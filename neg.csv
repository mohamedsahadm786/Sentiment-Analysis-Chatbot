"With a cast that reads like the Vogue Oscar party guest list, Valentine's Day should have been can't-miss cinema instead of standard Hollywood schmaltz."
"Small pleasures aside, the movie doesn't offer anything particularly memorable or inventive."
"Vanderbilt tries to show us the TV news reporting process from inside the fishbowl, but he doesn't so much walk us through the world as talk and talk and talk us through it."
"Rumor Has It doesn't seem to realize who its most interesting character is and spend some time with her. Coo, coo, ca choo, Mrs. Robinson. Here's to you."
A handsome dud.
The film suggests Jennifer Connelly's snorri-cam puke scene from Requiem for a Dream stretched out to 80 minutes.
It feels a lot like X-Men: The Diluted TV Adaptation.
"Flattened out and oversimplified to the point of preposterousness...Eastwood's never handled such a squeaky-clean, insufferably perfect protagonist before, and let's hope he never does again."
"Yes, people act out when they're unhappy. Usually, however, their efforts are not reduced to pop-psychological pablum like this."
"The observations of the filmmaker herself end up making her intentions very diffuse and her ambition something deeply vacuous and, ironically, inconsequential."
"Since his death in 1973, the country singer Gram Parsons's legend has become a figure of worshipful legend, to which this rambling, low-key movie makes a modest contribution."
You can't help but wonder how much more someone like Werner Herzog could have done with the story.
"For a movie about a chef who just will not shut up about how great everything needs to be, he sure is stuck in a movie that otherwise screams milquetoast, in both ideas and execution."
"The problem with this new release lies in his script, which comes as the film, too late, 40 years too late. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"It would be just a special-effects-and-hardware extravaganza, with a dead-end script full of wrong turns, were it not for Robert Downey Jr. and a game and witty cast."
It's the kind of cutesy idea that doesn't ring remotely true.
"Dark Places along with Gone Girl, mystifies in terms of Flynn crafting such distasteful female characters. Then handing over for co-conspiratorial execution, so to speak, stories precipitating the misfortunes of the men around them, to male filmmakers."
unfunny and aimless
"Our star, framed in many an alluring closeup, gives us nothing here. She's almost expressionless, and however ""true to life"" that might be for a cold-blooded killer, that choice makes for a dull, uninvolving performance."
"Once the story chooses its path, a glance downward reveals the ruts worn by the many plot vehicles that have traveled this road before."
"Wades in its own shallow cleverness, and seems to be under the misapprehension that acknowledging the shallowness of the characters and storyline is, in itself, clever. But it only takes a few scenes for that observation to become painfully obvious."
"Influences of The Funhouse, The Strangers, and even Saw are all woven throughout, but without the innovation or imaginative set pieces that made those movies memorable. Despite what the premise suggests, there's nothing ""extreme"" about this haunt."
It's a sorry situation when actors as talented and funny as Queen Latifah and Steve Martin waste their efforts in an offensive exercise that feels like a bad sitcom.
"A near-miss, a supernatural romance-cum-whodunit that strains under the weight of its warring elements."
"The Bangkok cinematography has its moments but falls short of the gritty realism of the original. The whiff of the ""exotic"" is redolent of Judith Chalmers' banal old TV travelogues."
"There's nothing particularly groundbreaking here in terms of storytelling, and it seems like a fairly trivial waste of its two leads."
"The cynicism is so blatant and unpleasant, but seemingly pointed at nothing, that I found it draining to watch."
"A great wall separates the producers, writers and directors at present from the kind of mental effort it takes to represent the world in a serious artistic manner. For the most part, unhappily, they have only clichés and guesswork at their disposal."
"Blakeson, who worked low-budget wonders on The Disappearance of Alice Creed, handles the shifts and twists of the plot efficiently enough, but the result remains lumpen and crucially lacking in surprise."
"The cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious, untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate."
"Dull dialogue, a dull story, and dull animation. What's left?"
"In a sense, this qualifies as animal cruelty."
"The actors don't interact so much as issue pronouncements, and there's not a hint of levity to distract from the gravity of the situation."
The very lightness and froth that initially makes Blithe Spirit such an enjoyable experience eventually leads it to peter out into almost nothing.
"Boozing, violence, and cursing in so-so Southern thriller."
To call the acting amateurish does a disservice to hard-working amateurs everywhere.
"After an intriguing setup, Runner Runner devolves into a by-the-books thriller."
"The Dead Don't Die, instead, stomps in like your drunken uncle at a wedding disco and announces that it's here, and that everything's fine because it's going to have a lot of fun at the zombie movie's expense. If only."
"A quest toward an inevitable inspirational destination, continuing the recent trend of using precious theater space as dumping grounds for a-cinematic PBS also-rans."
"The In Crowd isn't a movie, it's Gorgonzola, a crumbly summertime stinker veined with pop-cultural fungus."
"A collection of dry interviews and so-so music, it's better suited to public TV than the big screen."
You'll shake your head in disbelief at the nonsensical plot machinations and idiotic character motivations required to bring the two terror titans together.
Kevin Bacon has been within zero degrees of separation from so many great filmmakers that it's remarkable how virtually every decision he makes as director of Loverboy is completely misguided.
The film is way too goofy for all but the most thumbstruck Hitchhiker.
Its just a pig pile of atrocities happening to people you barely know.
"It's beautifully shot and too long, and contains pained references to the Holocaust; it's a movie tailor-made for awards rather than for personal reasons."
"The sequel to 2008's ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" isn't a movie so much as an amusement-park ride without the park. Or much grown-up amusement."
"This theme-park-inspired adventure is one small step for cinema, one giant leap for corporate synergy."
"""Small Time"" has its heart in the right place, but its screenplay's in serious need of a tuneup."
"Sam Levinson may have based Malcolm & Marie on actual events from his life, but more distance from the material was needed."
A leaden attempt to recapture the effervescence of classic screwball.
For Python cultists and completists only.
"Simply runs out of good ideas and, like a nominee behind in the polls, starts throwing anything and everything at the voters/audience to see what sticks. Not much does."
Not even Wilkinson's undoubted class is enough to give it the kiss of life.
... the kind of mess that never should have made it to theaters.
It's tough to build a character study around an unconvincing character.
"It is virtually impossible to watch The Master of Disguise and not feel embarrassed for stars Dana Carvey, Jennifer Esposito, and Brent Spiner."
Does an Oscar winner like Berry really need money so badly that she consents to be in this?
"Redford has said that he wanted to go out on a fun note, and that is an accurate description of this movie."
"When Hollywood bakes a pulp pastry like Daredevil, the dough that rises isn't simply the budget. You can feel your mind becoming a sponge cake, so porous that air whistles through it like wind."
"In trying to balance grandiosity with playfulness, to lampoon cowboy-and-Indian clichés while taking somber account of a history of violence, greed and exploitation, it descends into nerve-racking incoherence."
"You have to appreciate director Edgar Wright's ambition, but watching this highly stylized film is an arduous undertaking."
"La despedida de Robert Altman no está entre lo mejor de su obra, pero es una cálida evocación de tiempos y ritos pasados animada por un atractivo elenco."
The title stands as a beckoning call to audiences to join in the devilish delights Chase has conjured. Yet the scares fail to scale from a mobile device to the big screen.
"The good news for Carey is that she gets to prove she's a pretty decent actress after all. The bad news, of course, is that she's done it in a movie no one has any other reason to see."
"The funniest moments are the unrelated, extraneous conversations that fill up space between physical actions."
"Know this: There are no original romantic comedies anymore, only original people in them. Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds make The Proposal a lot better than it ought to be."
"The movie attempts a false ending that doesn't quite work; the picture feels prolonged, dragged out, and its ennui lessens the impact of some of its more terrifying fillips."
Go in with (very) low expectations and they may just be surpassed.
"A concoction seemingly plucked from the lower rungs of Tim Burton's filmography, with eccentricity as the main attraction."
Alternates between a slurry of Franz Marc expressionism and the most elaborate Thundercats episode ever made
"Facetious and amusingly amoral, it lacks cohesion and consistency - and the carnage is far from comedic."
A fruitless franchise launch for a series I doubt we will ever see again&#46;
The one running joke in The Animal becomes familiar and predictable all too soon.
What is the point?
Vampire movies should suck but not like this. Some will want to drive a wooden stake through my heart. It's a waste of time. Ask anyone who knows me. I don't have a heart.
"Throws into sharp relief the hitherto unexplored tragedy of the artist's life. Imagine it: you're one of the great artists of the 20th century, and yet your own story is embarrassingly contrived."
"The notion of pets leading a double life has been much tapped for family movies, and the kid-friendly spy genre has been wrung dry."
The latest from director Rob Reiner is a well-meaning mess that wants to tap into universal experiences of childhood and first love but bogs down in squirm-inducing banalities.
A manic and not entirely convincing romantic comedy in which there is no discernible difference between its characters drunk or sober.
"A formulaic slab of supernatural dirge destined to be forgotten by year's, or perhaps even month's, end."
Hollow Man is hollow is because there's a void where its imagination should be.
"Little more than another tone-challenged stumble through mob clichés as prevalent as the trash, graffiti and flared threads dominating the period design."
It would just be way too easy to hate Bad Boys 2. It would be too easy to say the excessive humor involving human cadavers is nauseating. It would be too easy to say that jokes at the expense of dead women are offensive.
"Terminator Genisys plays like the worst piece of fan fiction ever written. Every imaginable sort of cheap gratification is thrown up on the screen, to the point where the film eventually begins to feel desperate."
Slick-looking and initially engaging film fails to live up to its premise and becomes deeply silly in the final third.
Steeped in an all-consuming aura of audacious indulgence.
This film is somewhat interesting and a good first effort for Zach Braff in his directorial debut.
Director Chelsom...can't obscure the rigging which holds up a plot that should be lighter than air.
"Given the title, it's remarkable how little space is granted to the offspring, who are introduced as excretory machines, sex-blocking irritants, and occasional simpering angels, but never as beings unto themselves."
It's the definition of 'nothingness.'
Thriller's coherence gets lost in the Tasmanian wilderness.
"Despite its drawbacks, Zorro is acceptable in a pinch though not without its puzzling elements."
There's something undeniably compelling about the cast's daringly go-for-broke performances... but Daniels fragments the narrative and throws in so many tricksy directorial touches that the whole thing becomes an annoyingly indulgent mess.
"This could have been a great survival epic, but instead it's just a mediocre piece of eye-candy."
Crudely made tear-jerker.
"... An earnest, heavy-handed adaptation of Bethan Roberts’s tragic love story, for which the word “plodding” seems all too appropriate."
"While interesting, at nearly two hours the film feels repetitive and, compared to 'Room 237,' rather shallow."
"Stardust is a mostly listless odyssey, its lack of excitement compounded by the absence of Bowie's music."
Someone should tell O'Haver and the gaggle of writers it took to write this unenchanted mess that updated doesn't have to mean washed-up and dumbed-down.
"Even the slightest misstep is going to be magnified in this type of film and threaten the credibility of the narrative, and unfortunately that is what happens here."
A terrible closure for a trilogy that never should have existed. Remove McAvoy's performance and Glass is laughable. [Full review in Spanish]
There&#8217;s some macabre glee&#44; but you&#8217;ll leave wanting more&#46; Or at least a lot less of the digital gore&#46; The Terrifier guy is the brightest effect&#46; The rest of &quot;The Mean One&quot; is a tad too suspect&#46;
"Slow, overly respectful, and crushingly earnest, Ghostbusters: Afterlife is proof that fans should always be careful what they wish for."
"A very cold film for an author who is always remembered by the warmth of his prose, the overflowing imagination, and his adventurous spirit. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Romcom - like everything else in this text-happy society - is two words shortened and bonded together. If only the movie was chopped and shortened.
&#91;O&#93;ne gets the sense that this movie was made by people who realized they probably had much better things to do than to care about making this movie&#46;
[This] is the first time I feel like The Force is no longer with the franchise and the Darkside of corporate cookie-cutter greed has proven to be victorious.
This is one motel comedy that does not warrant an extended stay.
"Headache-inducing, and featuring one of the worst D-movie performances of the aughts from Costas Mandylor, the latest ""Saw"" franchise addition is more of the same torture-punishment-rehab-porn audiences have come to expect."
A problematic blockbuster with one essential saving grace: It's profoundly frightening in a way that few directors have the talent to capture.
"The real disappointment is that the film does not transport an audience to another world, as 300 did. Nor does the third-rate Chandler-esque narration by Rorschach help."
"Like bread without yeast, 'Angela's Ashes' minus the author's wit can't rise to meet expectations."
A supine memorial to missed opportunities and frustrating directorial choices.
"The gimmick wears thin quickly, and the story's social commentary is too superficial to matter. Even Barrymore's undeniable charm isn't enough to warrant a recommendation."
Struggles to be complex enough for adults yet simple enough for kids and ends up giving neither audience exactly what it wants.
"Annabelle is a dire effort from all involved: thoughtless, wholly uninspired and utterly unnecessary."
"Tedious and tiresome, it's not surprising that the gag reel over the concluding credits is funnier than the 90 minutes that preceded it."
You just have a film with a lot of silly situations and none of them make it to being funny. Jonathan Demme has a real ear for how people don't talk and a real feeling for how people don't behave.
"Penn is no Malick, and even more certainly no Tarkovsky; the transcendence he seeks through character study flops because [it] purports to embellish rather than enunciate character."
"This movie not only has literally no cause for existence, but it's a testament to how faceless, lazy, and pathetic movies can be."
[McQuarrie] spreads a unearned veneer of intelligence over...a plot one character aptly describes as 'grassy-knoll ludicrous.'
Russell&apos;s misstep with Amsterdam is as unexpected as it is shocking&#46;
As dull as the cubicle work that it's about!
"Unfortunately, Godzilla cannot be on screen all of the film's near-interminable 140 minutes. And when Godzilla goes missing, so does the film. "
Melancholy Will Smith film about extreme selflessness.
"As much as Angelina Jolie and Michelle Pfeiffer squaring off holds appeal, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil falls solidly into the terrain of 'sequel that no one but accountants asked for.'"
"One feels bad for Smith, who looks weary beyond what his character feels; it's as though he finds it exhausting to deliver the trite hard-boiled dialogue."
"The Crazies is 101 minutes long and about 87 minutes of that is crap. The characters are lifeless, the scares are predictable and the allusions to the Iraq War are even more fucking mad than you'd expect."
"The lives of these four friends are lived at a monotonous level; they lack the words and perhaps the concepts for pastimes more challenging than drinking, smoking dope, holding aimless arguments and getting into meaningless fights."
"At best a tossed-off lark that taxes its creator not at all, and at worst feels like some exercise that everybody involve decided to joylessly grind through."
I'd be lying if I said it didn't annoy the hell out of me for most of its 103-minute running time. But I might watch it again sometime and try a little harder to get on its wavelength.
A misfire in virtually every respect...Tonally the picture is a mess rather than a satisfying blend of disparate moods.
"... more pose than convincing psychological portrait, leaving little more than a well executed horror film with a very different kind of sexual danger."
"To viewers without a preexisting emotional relationship to the couple and their saga, that everyday angst is just banal."
The whole thing feels less like a genuine Woody Allen comedy than a pale imitation.
"It feels flat, disjointed, with too many moving parts."
"While this could have been the perfect portrait of a certain kind of idiot, the baroque cruelties and tonal monotony go too far."
"While it is a treat to see this kind of old-fashioned film making a comeback, it's hard not to wish that the story grabbed us emotionally as convincingly as those darn fires."
Only existing fans of Virginia Woolf and Vita Sackville-West are likely to be drawn to this stiff recounting of the writers' 1920s Sapphic affair.
"When an ancient army of foot-long Nazi sausage clones, called Bratzis, begins to attack their small Canadian town, two girls must put down their iPhones to save the day."
"Callas deserves, at the very least, a film the equal of Amadeus. This isn't it."
A killer thriller exploit that will hold some appeal for audiences that tense up in enjoyment at every fresh spurt of blood and ask for little more.
"The evolution of the little mouse who could glosses over the domination of Disney as a corporation, the gluttony of its toy manufacturing, and the growing emptiness of Mickey. Perhaps Mickey is an endearing piece of iconography because hes a blank slate."
"Suggests an incipient posthumanism in more senses than one &#8230; both compelling and troubling in a way that reminds me of the History Channel series ""Life After People."""
Pointless remake of the 1951 by the usually overrated John Carpenter
"The film picks up some, but by that point its myopic pandemic over-focus will likely have made many check out."
"Limitless riffs boundlessly on what it means to be creative and how chemical stimulation (speed, booze, whatever) can tamp and temper the willpower necessary to achieve greatness. It's all fun and games until you start seeing stalker."
The whole thing seems to be about five hours long.
"A cheerful teen attitude infuses this sci-fi adventure with enough interest to keep us watching, even if it's never remotely challenging."
"Worst of all, it soft-sells the horror of ethnic cleansing, with a climactic neighbourhood massacre reduced to a few broken windows and some offensive chanting."
"[Crossfire] has the neatness of a Chiclet, the tone of a nickel, and the speed of a hiccup."
"Guys are idiots, lower your standards? I can't tell you how sick I am of seeing this moronic message beaten into women's heads in cinematic 'romance' after romance."
Do you ever feel like everyone but you is in on the joke?
"Too many different stories are vying for attention here, and none of them are very good."
"When it comes time to wheel Hefner out for his cameo, even he seems irritated by these guys."
There are foetuses that would be more convincing in the role of a jaded lawman than Wood. You can festoon him with hookers and drug paraphernalia - he still looks like a newly hatched baby bird.
"You can't say ""Bayou Caviar"" doesn't have twists, but it has the wrong ones."
Just might work as a glossy thrill ride for viewers oblivious to the actual events it haplessly trivializes.
"More aptly titled Sexually Desirable When Drugged, the movie features slumbering sex slaves in what seems like a necrophiliacs brothel for grumpy old men, and nothing less than a romanticized and lusty aesthetic portrayal of date rape."
A big case of wasted potential.
Aiyaary is sketchily-written and not compelling. It tests patience even if you are a fan of the genre.
It almost seems like they made things up as they went along.
Yet another adaptation of the classic novel that falls very short.
Offers little that Scorsese doesn't offer with more lan and wit.
Middle-earth should never feel this middling.
"Star Anna Kendrick's appeal is stretched to its limit here, and her lover Jeremy Jordan's character is hard to take in large doses."
"Zhang's mixture of unsparing violence, mawkish sentimentality and garish flourishes creates one uncomfortable aesthetic."
"It's plenty stupid, often funny and occasionally pithy. That may add up to a movie you want to see, or it might add up to a movie that will make you ill."
Feels like an elongated episode of a series rather than a standalone movie.
Innocence is about what it means to confront death and mortality. But what it needs more than anything is some life in it.
"Hardcore action buffs might be willing to forgive the unfortunately generic nature of Triple Threat based solely on the star power alone, but those who require even their basic genre fare to have a little substance to it are advised to look elsewhere."
How so many talented people came together here and just so completely whiffed on one of the most incredible stories ever written is beyond me.
"By constantly weaving these tales together, Rubin takes humanity out of the equation, almost as if all these human intersections were engineered by technology, not an increasingly interrelated world."
"Scenes that should take 30 seconds take three minutes. Writer-director Jon Watts does successfully channel childhood, though: He's like a kid short of ideas who triple-spaces his book report."
"I like my action movies complicated, but At World's End is less a complexity than it is a high seas bazaar with everyone and everything vying for attention. You end up going home with nothing to show for your adventure."
If they weren't dressed like members of Earth Wind & Fire you could be forgiven for thinking you were watching a left-wing book group in a trendier corner of Portland
"This second film from writer-director Brady Corbet (The Childhood of a Leader) is subtitled A Twenty-First Century Portrait, and it's exactly as pretentious as that sounds."
"While at times the film does reach great heights, a certain indecisiveness about what exactly it is, The Aeronauts often finds itself adrift in the moments it gets off the ground at all."
"As for the singing, it's pleasant but unctuous and, frankly, made me squirm."
There is a bulky bundle of sports movie cliches to sort through here if you do intend to follow the rise of wizardly soccer winger Santiago Munez (Kuno Becker)...
"the cast seem embalmed, as does most of the action..."
This is a Mystery Science Theater 3000 special.
"The movie is one big scream, clichéd and hardly credible as an oblique call to civility."
"As the end credits finally rolled, the best review was uttered by a woman in the row behind me: ""This is the kind of movie they'll show on Starz in a couple months and you'll watch when you're really bored."""
"At a painfully overlong 144 minutes, Motherless Brooklyn will leave you hailing for the nearest NY taxi cab to come and take you far, far away."
"Lock your doors. Bolt your windows. And for heaven's sake, stay away from the multiplex."
"The movie is caught in the crossfire of its two missions -- to celebrate the universal things that ""really matter"" in life (friendship, family) and to celebrate what it means to live like Jack Nicholson."
"The plot goes through motions that will be tiresomely familiar to anyone who saw Baby Boom, Three Men And A Baby, Raising Waylon or dozens of other movies about unplanned parenthood."
"Dull and instantly forgettable, a nostalgia trip that takes you nowhere worth going."
"As the god-doubting theologian sent to Rome to learn exorcism as a way to conjure up his missing faith, a less charismatic figure couldn't be found."
What the film lacks is heart.
"There is nothing fun about Sith, except maybe the opening space battle, and it's not so much an adventure as an ordeal."
Loses altitude faster than AMR stock.
"A filmed bloodletting like no other on record, essentially a terribly graphic two-hour torture sequence."
Why bother remaking a cult classic?
"""The comedy is as familiar as the ceremony at a cookie-cutter wedding factory: Much feels old or borrowed; nothing feels new."""
"It seems sacrilegious to dismiss a zombie movie by Romero, who's been blending horror and satire since 1968's Night of the Living Dead. But his latest approach feels uncomfortably behind the curve."
Inside somehow manages to be remarkably devoid of suspense throughout its brief running time.
"If you support your family picking lettuce, your life is more interesting than Linklater's family."
"Bad, but never painfully so . . ."
"With an easy-in towards 80s nostalgia and the creativity to explore a techno-horror, it had such potential to unlock something exciting and fright-inducing. Instead it feels underdeveloped and like a mashup of other mediocre films that have come before."
The result is a film too cold for melodrama and too restrained for tragedy.
Domino is less a movie than a hyperkinetic slide show -- presented during a nuclear attack.
"Depp portrays Wilmot, who was also remembered for scandalous poetry and theatrical satire, as a careless and generally unpleasant fellow, who is neither funny nor profound. And we're supposed to spend two hours with this guy. Ugh."
Damien Chazelle&apos;s new Hollywood epic is full of excess&#46; Sometimes&#44; to a fault&#46; 
"The agony of Untraceable is as predictable as a computer program, and about as inhuman."
It's difficult to swallow the premise of yet another tale of a heroic white Westerner with good intentions trying to give hope to Middle-Eastern misery.
"When it comes to big-screen biopics, ""Lovelace"" never makes it past the shallow end of the pool."
"...Fox is wasted, given nothing more to do then wear revealing outfits and pout."
Cranston is theatrical and showy as Trumbo - his performance seems to come though his cigarette holder.
"If not for Mazur's script dropping the ball, this might have been just worthy of a mild recommendation. Kinnear, however has a future behind the camera if he wants it."
Watching this movie is like visiting a museum with two fey tour guides who lack any real insight.
"It's not particularly bad, just deeply, painfully average."
"[Burstyn's] best scenes with a Bee are with Loretta Devine's Sally, whose uproarious bit on 'underboob sweat' is the film's funniest. But these elements are like a life raft on the Titanic."
"The rug is never really pulled out from underneath you, which is all you really take away from a good mystery, but as a debut feature, The Cow shows promise. "
"Several performers from the original Grease return for the sequel, but not the important ones. Most conspicuously absent is John Travolta, replaced here by Maxwell Caulfield, who can't lift the original greaser's comb."
"With the exception of Mr. Strasberg and Mr. Levene, the actors are as hysterical as their material."
A disappointment.
The best I can offer is the damning of faint praise: Inferno is a modestly entertaining diversion.
"For every three eye-roll-worthy scenes, Snow Cake offers one that's genuinely funny or moving."
Ultimately comes up short.
Only the &#8220;Scream&#8221; series fans will want to see this film&#44; seeing the previous two are required to understand a lot of the plot and non-fans will both be lost and bored&#46;
"An underwhelming heist-gone-wrong movie that, inexplicably, has avoided going straight to DVD."
"Cold and scattered, Minority Report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals. That's not vintage Spielberg and that, finally, is minimally satisfying."
'Death Wish' goes the corporate route in this silly action-thriller that's nonetheless leagues beyond Nicolas Cage's usual fare.
"The third installment in Sylvester Stallone's jobs program for expired action heroes is easily the best of the bunch, which is not to say it's any good."
"The first, comparatively lucid Transformers was a headache, but I sort of enjoyed it....Revenge of the Fallen is more like listening to rocks in a clothes dryer for 2 1/2 hours."
"Expectedly, the cinematography is superb. And Rahul Bose as the conflicted handyman stands out. The rest of it is quite linear and ordinary."
"Catch and Release is overlong and unfocused but not entirely unlikable. Unfortunately, its least likable element is its lead character, Gray, played by Jennifer Garner."
"In the end, the film doesn't feel like it's about very much at all. It's a throwaway movie, a bit of filler in the Woody Allen canon."
Overall the picture is a bland affair&#44; from the farfetched original premise through a relatively laugh-free midsection to a finale that&#8217;s a definition of manufactured sentimentality&#46; 
"Fails so completely to generate suspense, shock, dramatic momentum or anything else that a kind-hearted viewer may end up rooting for it out of sympathy as it slowly digs its own grave."
"Though Pedro Pascal and Kristen Wiig do their best to inject life into their respective villains, Wonder Woman 1984 is a two and a half hour empty shell of pseudo-inspiration and laughably bad action."
"Memorable set-pieces aside, the film trips up on far too many horror nods and tropes, shifting awkwardly to fit them all in."
"Even with the director hustling his cast like a fashion-show martinet, there's only so much cartoon emoting to be done before we're anticipating a TV commercial break."
Saying this movie is better than the first two solo Thor movies is faint praise&#46; While not Thorrible&#44; Thor&#58; Love and Thunder has few real triumphs&#44; and its disappointments are glaring&#46;&#10;
"I grew to resent the way the storylines began to collide and converge -- it isn't a small world, it's microscopic."
"A simpler, leaner treatment would have been preferable; after all, being about nothing is sometimes funnier than being about something."
"For those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects, the new Star Wars installment hasn't escaped the rut dug by the last one."
"A tune that humorlessly circles back in on itself, sounding seductive in parts but leaving dissatisfaction in its wake."
"Absolutely beautifully photographed, deeply respectful of Tibetan culture, and more than a bit tedious."
"Antonio Banderas is a charming and talented man, but in Take the Lead he lays on the old-world panache so thick -- the accent, the flowery courtliness, the romance of romance -- that he comes off like Dracula's metrosexual cousin."
A History of Violence is a hollow story from an empty graphic novel. A master -- Canada's David Cronenberg -- has directed it. But all he can do with the material is turn it into a clinic on movie mayhem.
It sets up this distaff-Deliverance scenario much better than it pays it off.
"Consists of mistaken identity screwball nonsense, slapstick gags and yawning sentimentality. The feel is close to that of a weeknight sitcom, with jokes that seem as though they should be accompanied by a laugh track."
Another buffoon 007 by Moore
"Less the blistering satire it imagines itself than a blustering, bloody, blundering melodrama."
[An] almost endearingly silly amuse bouche of a comedy depicting how the End of Days might play out in Seattle ...
"Could have benefited from the presence of, say, Ralph Macchio, Kobe Bryant, Clay Aiken or Michael Jackson as a singing priest."
The lack of a streamlined narrative and reliance on manipulative devices turn a story of stark significance into a middling melodrama.
The profoundly mediocre screenplay was factory-farmed and you can feel the various conflicting drafts grinding up against one another.
"Zwick's latest film, Defiance, is based on an exceptional true story. Regrettably, the movie is anything but exceptional, and represents Zwick's most disappointing work in more than a decade."
Those in search of a film about gay men disillusioned in Hollywood with a better script and more dramatic heft should rent Gods And Monsters or Thom Fitzgerald's Beefcake.
[Cage] shouldn't do any more movies in which his character signals his acceptance of a Faustian bargain by buying two candy bars.
Perhaps the biggest disappointment in Humpday is Shelton's murky motivation for the porno film.
"Too much of a slight and, at times, self-consciously naughty-minded thing."
"A comedy with no redeeming features that may be, in what is now a depressingly competitive field, Martin's worst film to date."
"""The Millers"" might be the first movie ever made that could have been improved by casting Pamela Anderson, Charlie Sheen, Lindsay Lohan and Chris Brown."
"While nothing here frightened me like its TV predecessor so long ago, it scares me to think that those involved read the script and thought it would be great from start to finish. It isn't. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)"
A lightweight teen horror that only breaks from the formula when it comes to the less-than-terrifying predator.
Dull blades. Saddles audiences with a buckets-of-blood mentality that deadens the spirit and drowns the film.
"There's nothing wrong with updating the ""old dark house"" chiller as long as it's done with style and humor. These are, however, precisely the qualities sorely lacking in ""The Legacy."""
like two Syd Field books falling in love
"As lousy as the movie is, I must speak up for its makers' valiant attempt to make something old look new and also old ... and new. It's a vexing problem for a system that relies on sequels, ""franchises,"" ""tentpoles,"" etc."
"Uninspired and inconsequential, The International provides less thrills than a meeting with your local bank manager to discuss interest rates."
Just about the best thing that can be said for this spiritual potboiler is that it is not much worse than The Da Vinci Code.
The movie is often a lot of loopy fun -- it's just not very good.
Parents ... are more likely to experience the film as a blend of clumsy slapstick and mind-numbing bathos.
"Come on Vincent, throw in some food coloring for us!"
"Traditionally dreadful Christmas comedy that's brought down by a combination of atrocious acting, terrible writing, cloying sentimentality and jaw-droppingly bad special effects."
"""Abduction"" is just the third movie John Singleton has directed in the past decade, and it contains neither the passion nor the competence of his two previous genre efforts - ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" and ""Four Brothers."""
"The performances are convincing, and sufficiently nuanced to elevate the characters beyond mere clich."
The film's story is so dry and unimaginative that it appears to have been preserved in amber from an earlier era.
Roteness is no excuse for something as egregiously bland and bungled as Firebird.
"It cuts back on the rapid-fire pop culture references that dominate the other films to focus on the story, but unfortunately, the story isn't all that interesting."
The plot remains joyless in its contrivances.
"The screenplay is so lacking in narrative sensibilities, it's difficult to enumerate all its failings."
An inspiring true-life story gets a less-than-inspired film dramatization.
"The final sequence is not only surprisingly satisfying, but offers us an uncomfortable moment that resembles closure, while avoiding an overly clean denouement. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of this ending highlights the weakness that preceded it."
"A solid yet unspectacular film by Francis Lee, rescued by some flawless performances by Winslet and Ronan."
"...far from the light-hearted, family-friendly comedy its promotional materials have been promising..."
Amy Schumer is always fun company. But who the hell thought that making plus-size jokes then simply tacking on a moralizing ending was hilarious? Or acceptable?
"Awkwardly tries to balance gross-out gags with tender, warm-and-fuzzy moments."
"Caper flicks should stay two steps ahead of the audience, and this one just barely keeps pace."
"Plays like a melodramatic rip-off of Bret Easton Ellis books about insufferable kids obsessed with money, drugs and themselves."
Fanning practically dares the audience to throw sharp objects at the screen with her thoroughly obnoxious performance.
"Gosling is given the barest blueprint of a life gone terribly wrong and the actor struggles to make something out of nothing, though he does manage to give the older David an aura of weirdness that is downright creepy."
"A three-hour practical joke without a punchline, at once maddeningly obscure and infinitely boring."
"In their quest to make this film different, however, I just feel Anderson and Wilson forgot to make it interesting."
A mostly unsuccessful animated feature that repackages established DC Comics lore as a separate origin story involving the superheroes&#8217; pets&#46; 
May be one of the most cheerfully unamusing movies in a long time.
"Camp Rock is not all that good. It doesn't have the earnest, smart silliness of the High School Musical franchise."
"Both Weisz and the always agreeable Fraser... are capable and attractive performers, but the film drags its uninspiring action out too long for anyone's good--even for anyone who's not 14."
You know a movie's in trouble when it's called The Arrival and nothing arrives -- the film's aliens are already here.
"They're not just making fun of rom-coms but of the idea of satire itself, or of the idea of jokes have to have meaning or logic or resonance. Fans will no doubt be amused; for everyone else, the results are so post-modern that they're post-funny."
The best part is the interpretation of that excellent actress named Marion Cotillard. But it is not enough to stop Mal de Pierre to be mediocre. [Full review in spanish]
"It's ostensibly a remake of the 1950 Walter Lang comedy, though latter-day audiences will detect a far greater kinship to an early episode of The Brady Bunch with twice the brats."
"It's a minimalist science fiction film that builds an impressive atmosphere, but that can't escape from superficiality. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Joseph Cedar's Footnote is a sour, rather unpleasant affair that hinges on acts of Jews behaving badly."
"Nothing more than insufficiently directed codswallop in delectable costumes, with a starry cast who are worthy of much, much better."
The Scorch Trials is trying to pack a lot into its running time but it still feels like a bridge between two better movies.
"At best, the random, endless Steadicam shots set to Arvo Pärt symphonies suggest he's boned up on his Tarr and Tarkovsky; at worst, they're examples of an empty formalism that adds nothing and mistakes showing off for significance."
"Sorry, dudes: This is a totally bogus sequel."
"Every meninist who forgets that he is not a real term is on you. Every subsequent Sonu ke Titu ki Sweety ka Punchnama will be on you. And the joke, as always, will sadly be on us."
"When did comedies get so mean? Step Brothers has a premise that might have produced a good time at the movies, but when I left, I felt a little unclean."
Eastwood loses control of the last half of the movie because he has no interest in the specifics of the mystery and because his view of police corruption is confusing at best.
Code Name: The Cleaner is one of the year's big stinkers.
"Although she has made two films in rapid succession, Sarif shows no discernible aptitude for her new medium."
Thought it was impossible to make the story of a drug-addicted musical icon boring? You were wrong.
"Smallfoot doesn't always trust the music's ability to move the story along, so the movie proceeds in fits and starts..."
"The Royal Wedding is actually less entertaining than the original, mostly because it failed to produce more bizarre, fairy-tale inspired sequences - like the ""heroine attacked by wolves"" scene in the original version."
"After a rousing early stretch, The Witches takes a colder turn before a sunny-again conclusion that feels rushed and incomplete."
"It looks great, and James Newton Howard's score works ... however, are good performances and handsome visuals enough to recommend what is ultimately a drab, weary yarn?"
...didn't pry so much as a giggle from my lips until 42 minutes in...
Didn't seem to add up to much when it was all over.
"Duvall can justify it all, he's just that kind of actor, but ""A Night in Old Mexico"" hasn't worked hard enough to give him a story worthy of his talents. In many cases, he is acting all alone up there."
Eventually you sense that the whole movie is spinning its wheels.
This film about spirituality and faith suffers from the lack of both.
"A PG-13 sitcom rom-com that desperately wants to be a Judd Apatow movie when it grows up, Tom Vaughan's flat film mixes screwball comedy with self-help clichés to tired effect."
All the buzz in the world is not going to make the latest incarnation of the beloved 75-year-old radio/serial/comic book legend a fond memory for many viewers this month.
"A lazy, flat and poorly written thriller that fails at grabbing viewers by the throat or by the heart."
"Most surprising, Chris Rock isn't even consistently funny in the scenes he should have been able to do in his sleep -- his character's stand-up routines."
"For all the twists and turns and questions and complications of She Will, there’s something oddly undone -- too many answers avoided, too many possibilities unanswered, all topped with a too-neat ending that deviates wildly from the film’s tone."
"Smith can't find a tone to settle on here, and his imagination for the macabre is limited to the torture-porn aesthetics that have long overstayed their cinematic welcome."
"The film plays like Cloverfield redux, except with less personality and tension."
Cirque Du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant is a film with a chronic identity crisis and no clear idea where it's headed.
"There's no redeeming this movie, possibly the worst idea Hollywood has conceived in a decade."
"The movie wavers between Hallmark card sentimentality and goofy, life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial."
Mostly bland and unmemorable babysitter for kids too young to go trick-or-treating.
"The film is edited so skittishly that the actors are barely able to complete their sentences, let alone their thoughts. That's probably just as well."
Adds up to less than the sum of its better parts.
Pushes its thesis way past the breaking point of even the most gullible or charitable of viewers.
The violence and other shenanigans are too much and it distracts from the jokes.
What's good for `Domino' isn't necessarily what happened to Domino Harvey...
"Has gorgeous cinematography with spectacular landscapes -- plus a lazy script, forgettable performances and regrettably uninspired direction."
"There's nothing awful here, but also not a single aspect of the movie to really like."
"M&M-colored high school fantasia for aspirational 10- and 12-year-old girls who'll be shocked (or, hopefully, delighted) when they get to ninth grade and find out life isn't so super-Bratz-fabulous."
"A sob story that averts its eyes when things get uncomfortable about the tangle of sex and frustration. Still, you can't blame audiences for being seduced by two shining young stars."
"While apt at times, often it seems overwrought and muddled."
Interminably slow.
Quarantine fails to correct some of the problems evident in its predecessor while also incorporating a few defects of its own.
No audience will enjoy itself more at a film&#44; as long as they remember that this film is raunchy and does not stop at any boundary of good taste&#46;
"Involuntary drug use, the understanding female waiting at home, masturbating innocents, violent strangers with crowbars - it seems as if this whole film is a hangover from The Hangover."
"In the most inadvertently hilarious addition to Christies canon, Branaghs film begins with a tragic, black-and-white origin story for his silly mustache."
"A fairytale full of quotes and well intentioned ideas, but rather empty as a whole. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Despite poetic overtones, this film is a hack job--an overlit, underdirected, barely scripted longform music video celebrating violence and bastard amber gel."
"A compelling real-life story, an acclaimed director, impressive visuals, a good cast, First Man has so much going for it, which does not explain why the film is so underwhelming."
"'We have universal remotes in stock,' says 7-Eleven spokesperson Chandrashekhar 'Chan' Slurpeevasan. 'But normally we use them to fast forward past hold-ups to the point where charges are dropped and the perpetrator is set free.'"
Pretentious and pointless -- take a pass.
"The choreography is sloppy and lifeless; the outmoded blend of vintage rock, country and Broadway styles doesn't click; and the characters are such caricatures that it's no wonder the entire cast is overacting."
"---- a few years later, the two guys (from 'School of Rock') get together again and the film is a total dud! You're asking yourself ---- what the @#*!*?% happened?"
The backgrounds are too realistic and there's no warmth and little magic in the story and the characters.
"The problem with this far-fetched fable is that it delves into a painful part of Black history, plays loose and fast with details and time jumps in ridiculous ways."
"The dialogue is risible, there is no headline star like a Tom Cruise or Will Smith, nor is there a young star like Dakota Fanning to give us a wide-eyed interpretation."
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows isn't so much a movie as it is a product with a really long name. It's 112 minutes of CGI mayhem, snappy catch phrases and a standard hero plot, all pieced together in a familiar formula."
"When Flyboys finally ends, a too-long 139 minutes later, there's a sense of emptiness, perhaps even disgust."
Disappointingly overworked and mechanical.
"What is this, anyway? Noir? Thriller? Fantasy? A bit of all three...whatever it is, it's the kind of movie that you come out of saying, ""What was that all about?"""
"Though actor, writer, and director Emilio Estevez might again be ""on the wrong side of the law for all the right reasons,"" right reasons alone don't make for good art."
"A film that works for virtually all of its running time on a scene-by-scene basis, but also completely fails to work as a holistic object."
The weakness of the movie is that it so skims on what actions Pitsenbarger did to set him above other soldiers who voluntarily put their lives at risk.
"It's just not funny or fresh enough, and that has everything to do with the material and how it's handled visually, and nothing to do with the people on the screen."
"You want to say: ""Can I have the message in a separate envelope and just spend the film looking at the landscapes?"""
"The screenplay, unhappily, has retained the general flatness of the scenes on Earth...Scott has a number of talented performers at his disposal, who struggle to make something of the oddly colorless and often drama-less dialogue..."
"Even when it isn't depressing though, the characters are too flat and cartoon-like while the jokes are too few, too far between, and too often repeated."
"I had high hopes for Crimson Peak, a luscious thriller created by Guillermo del Toro, but what a prancing big mess it turned out to be."
"Please, not another boring action movie. Alas...too late."
At first Weir's approach to the harsh task of adapting O'Brien's unwieldy series of novels seems to be a clever idea.
"As a social experiment for the effects of marketing, the results of The Greatest Movie Ever Sold might hold some weight; as an entity unto itself, it's in limbo."
The reputation of Wes Anderson as one of America's most consistently over-rated directors gets another boost with his latest exercise in stylistic posturing and forced whimsy.
"A big-budget war thriller that sets up a nice little cinematic cat-and-mouse game but manages to fumble it with conventional, clichd and unrealistic storytelling."
"A horrible movie and an even worse parody, it's sad that one ends up laughing less with it than with 'Fifty shades of Grey'. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The desolate country is alluringly evocative, but Michôd relies too heavily on atmosphere when we need meaningful action."
"To call Tooth Fairy a bad film is like calling star Dwayne Johnson a big guy. Both statements are accurate, but neither actually conveys the degree to which they are true."
"What kills the movie ... is the script. That's strange, because it was known for years as one of the industry's best unproduced screenplays."
Bloated and overlong...
There's too much a sense of the frayed and familiar to Suspect Zero.
"Coraci doesn't impose much discipline, letting some scenes run wild and others peter out, their punch lines dangling."
Seeking Justice is a mostly fun but ultimately forgettable and generic thriller that makes me yearn for the days where Cage still gave a damn about his career
"The type of movie people say they don't make anymore, but when someone does, no one sees it."
The real problem is that September Dawn isn't a very good movie. It moves too much like a public-school history pageant and gives us mono-dimensional characters who speak dialogue that fairly reeks of printer's ink.
"It truly wouldn't take much - a minor re-edit, a few arch looks to camera, a wiseacre sidekick named 'Shortballs' - to inch this utterly mystifying throwback into spoof territory."
"A curious twist on the body swap comedy, with its talented creator and stars ostensibly pulling a switcheroo with a group of exponentially less talented people."
It&#8217;s a lot&#44; as they say&#44; and Ings does not have the skill to pull it all off successfully&#46;&#46;&#46;&#46; overstuffed and overreaching&#44; &#91;Punch&#93; puts both the characters and viewers through too much drama and suffering&#46; &#10;
I found it easy to root for the cast who deserve a ton of credit for keeping the film afloat&#46; But even they can&#8217;t sustain it among a deluge of half-witted gags&#44; crass and shallow dialogue&#44; and uninspired storytelling&#46;
"I'm probably not the first to say it's a train wreck. Starts out good enough, shows ability to the 1/2way mark, but the last 30 mins are just a scripting mess."
The visual invention and draughtsmanship are mightily impressive; a shame the drama's a bit of a bore.
"If Bowden's motivations were clearer, Apt Pupil might have gone somewhere interesting."
The heartwarming fuzzy feelings that the genre is built on never take flight for Penguin Bloom&#46;&#10;
You have a great cast that gets lost in an overstuffed story&#46; There&apos;s no emotional connections&#44; so many of the characters just didn&apos;t get enough screen time&#44; and the goals of what they&apos;re setting up with Kang feel too abstract&#46;
"Given content that screamed out for a vital, 'Boogie Nights'-style treatment, what we get is a workmanlike biopic that feels TV-safe rather than big-screen daring."
"Whenever Guy Pearce's Snow is on screen, the film's a fun, brainless, action flick with a main character that deserves a better movie."
"Po-faced, dull and sadistic, Man On Fire is a major disappointment from the Crimson Tide team of Denzel Washington and Tony Scott."
"As the ghosts suck the life out of their victims, the audience suffers the same fate."
Whatever gothic originality the first Human Centipede possessed is altogether lacking in this sorry follow-up.
"From time to time, hints of a smarter and more complex film peek through."
"Another misfire starring its director, Tom At The Farm is the first real folly from young French-Canadian director Xavier Dolan."
"Christopher Felver is too reverent to properly convey the invigoratingly profane, angry messiness of the sense of community that Lawrence Ferlinghetti and his peers too briefly brought to life."
&#8220;Sidney&#8221; works more as an explainer for why Sidney Poitier remains such an important figure in American history&#8212;not just Hollywood history&#8212;than it does as a warts-and-all biography of Sidney the man&#46;
"Although the film has a lot of charm and heartfelt, charismatic performances by Camacho and Ali (in one of his last roles), it’s not quite enough to overcome the slow-moving plot."
A Jaws ripoff no less ludicrous than Orca-Killer Whale... not only silly but narratively muddy and visually murky.
"What's the worst that could happen, you say? Well, for starters, getting locked in a theater showing this movie on a continuous, 24-hour loop."
"Not quite as good as it should have been, despite spirited performances from Black and Stiller and Christopher Walken on top crazy bonkers mental form."
"Woody Allen has a definite formula for his comedies, and his latest shows just how worn out, tired, and outdated it's become."
It stirs sympathy for one man's plight but little passion over the policy that imprisoned him.
"Despite its high craft level and Washington's participation in it, this movie's showy violence is finally as deadening as the over-emphatic violence in these kinds of films generally is."
"Static and dreary, drained of juice and drenched in ""respectable"" lighting"
"When every other scene looks like a cola, jeans or motorcycle commercial -- perfectly unposed with hair proudly mussed -- Gallo's motivations seem too compromised."
...there's simply never a point at which the almost distractingly uneventful narrative becomes as compelling as one might've hoped.
"The very flimsy premise of Playing God is bloated into 95 minutes of tedious and uninspired repetition, with dull acting and empty characters. It's ironic that this vapid comedy, which tries to use spirituality as a punchline, actually has no soul."
Wearyingly violent and drearily shot.
"I won't say this for many films, but ""Godzilla"" needs more carnage and intensity, and less of anything else it has."
"Niccol hits on some fascinating topics, many which layer on top of one another and weave in and out of the story, but Simone simply lacks bite."
"What we get in FearDotCom is more like something from a bad Clive Barker movie. In other words, it's badder than bad."
"This is Zhang's first feature, and while she handles her leads carefully, she can't always make their behavior credible."
"Wow, what a quaint little film Sneakers is!"
"Guy Ritchie's transformation from gritty, innovative filmmaker to by-the-numbers purveyor of explosions continues with King Arthur: Legend of the Sword..."
"Everything that made the Terminator films great is absent in this film. The violence, the terror, the basic fear is gone ... In this film, children defeat a terminator."
"Perhaps the makers of My Big Fat Greek Wedding subscribe to the Quentin Crisp theory of housekeeping %u2013 ""After the first four years, the dust doesn't get any worse"" %u2013 but this feels more like 70 years of dust, and badly in need of an airing out."
"This travesty is so pitiful, it isn't even worth being indignant."
"It's a slow-moving orgy of lowbrow grandiosity that's as tedious as it is overblown and pretentious. Songs, scenes, dance numbers, lyrics and set pieces all blend together into an indistinct, ludicrously self-serious mush."
"Moody, suggestive horror piece has fascinating elements, but never quite takes off."
"With farting contests, very scary monsters and lots of cleavage and short skirts, the movie appears to have young teenage boys more in mind than the kindergarten set. The script, however, is way too childish to attract teenagers."
"The Perfect Family seems to resist introspective pit stops, cruising toward its tidy resolution with a host of missed opportunities in its wake."
"This is a survival story marked by passivity, where those involved must simply bow down to the power of nature and hope for the best."
"The Strangers gave me a look of disbelief, not the suspension of same, with its jaw dropping flaws."
Master of Disaster Roland Emmerich lives down to his reputation with what amounts to the biggest snuff film of all time.
"[It has]a hardcore, colourful tone that is so much more enjoyable than the epic bleakness of Bats V Supes, but it is still a hardcore, colourful mess"
"Suffused with an air of dread thanks to director of photography Rob Hardy's atmospheric, dark-hued lensing, the film nonetheless never achieves the necessary dramatic tension."
Just terrible enough to make you wish it was even worse.
A big mess!
"Splendor, purportedly a a sex farce, has had all of its joy and energy surgically removed."
This watered-down throwback to The Wicker Man never really heats up.
"The only thing Playing for Keeps teaches us is: Guys, forget the bars and nightclubs. Soccer moms are where the action is."
[W]hy dramatize your premise when you can blow the windows out of an abandoned warehouse instead?
LaBute has replaced the seduction of the first film with a general sense of bewilderment and loss; it's good for building tension but doesn't fit with the payoff. The plot elements lead where they need to go well enough but don't mix particularly well.
"[Once Upon a Time In Hollywood] feels like the work of a man reaching for the novelistic dialogue of The Hateful Eight, the intimate characterisation of Jackie Brown, and the triumphant violence of Inglourious Basterds, but nailing none."
I did see and greatly enjoy the previous &apos;Bournes&#44;&apos; but was dizzied at what the heck was going on in this new take&#46; No doubt this is the end of the franchise&#46;
"In truth, ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"" is an excruciating grind, just scene after scene of people creating disturbance over tiny matters, fighting over nothing, and making Toula clean up after them."
"Still, no amount of-minor spoiler alert-blood geysers can quell the feeling that the whole of Suspiria doesn't add up to the sum of its witchy parts."
The film is generally plagued with incomplete plot elements.
"Rarely do the filmmakers show people mutually affecting one another in cycles of pain and control, rather than blaming phantom figures."
"Ultra Art-house, ultra obscure... a step down from Drive. (Video Review)."
It was competently made but overlong and occasionally infuriating.
"An abysmal, painfully unfunny comedy."
... perhaps one of the shabbiest excuses for a horror film in recent memory ...
"Likeable as they are, Kate and Leo are hampered by the heavy-handed storytelling going on around them."
Woefully unfunny.
"Intriguing as it is, I found the story too confusing, and the leading figures' supposed passion too remote, for the end result to feel all that rewarding."
The story is too slight.
"The dialogue is forced and stagey, the actions as predictable as they are improbable and the insights little more than dusty clichés."
The main problem is that the narrative is evasive...; we can't trust Mamet as a storyteller!
"For all the virtuosic technique on view, the schematic nature of the project is too glibly nihilistic."
"With its story actually quite interesting, a ruthless editor is all that would have been needed to turn this into a fantastic film."
"Another tale of an unusual program to help disadvantaged school kids turned into a formulaic, sappily uplifting Hollywood product."
"While co-writer/director Sheldon Candis and co-writer Justin Wilson's screenplay could have benefitted from a few more drafts (or at least a little more sobriety), the acting in Luv makes the skinny script more palatable."
In simplistic and self-congratulatory fashion&#44; the film renders its main character as a sort of feminist crusader who undermines the sexist traditions of her time&#46;
I hate the way the film forces us into its epic structure and purposefully fractured narrative as if the audience is a puppy having its little nose shoved in a puddle of its own making.
General Boredom meets Major Tedium on the Civil War fields of Virginia.
"The talented Liam Neeson makes a valiant effort to carry this wannabe Hitchcockian thriller on his solid shoulders, but, alas, he's defeated by an incongruous and improbable plot that gets worse as it unfolds after a promising start"
"'Teknolust' embarrassingly resembles insulting, insistent television commercials. Unfortunately, they may be the future."
90 minutes of mostly uninspired vapidity that appears to be ticking the correct Despicable boxes.
It's difficult to gauge who gets stranded more in Eight Below: the team of sled dogs left at the bottom of the world or audience members forced to sludge through two hours of very human melodrama to see them reunited with their handler.
The picture trades in hoary Bruce Willis police procedural clichs and underdeveloped conceits.
"Carpool, the new Tom Arnold comedy, is one ride to avoid, unless truly idiotic car-chase slapstick comedies are the destination genre."
"Throughout this desultory, dreary movie, odd lines of dialogue pop up that seem to perversely comment on the sheer superfluity of Ocean's 8."
"Okay for forgiving romance fans, and a maybe-see for the rest of us."
"It's directed as if by some mad Goth disco queen, utterly tweaked on crystal meth."
"... despite having excellent ingredients, this great adventure ends up repeating the franchise's go-to instruction manual in a surprisingly bland way. [Full review in Spanish]"
An overly gimmicky and fatally repetitive terrorist thriller that quickly wears out its welcome.
Sandberg does nothing to update his horror film from some of the genre's more damaging stereotypes.
"The intended humour mostly falls flat (lame jokes like ""cat got your tongue"" are neither funny nor logical), but there's something in the garish, glorious failure of it that can absolutely be enjoyed. It is unbelievable that it even exists."
"Noelle is perhaps the most ""woke"" Christmas comedy of all-time...but there has rarely been a more sanitized film, even for a Christmas movie."
"For a 20th-century story, this how-to-make-a-terrorist biopic carries a very 21st-first century sense of constant social crisis, but a disappointingly slick approach drains away any risky politics."
"It's not that you don't sympathise with the characters' sentiments it is, though, that you can't actually go along with their agenda."
"[The film] rarely bares its claws or its teeth, just its heart -- which, as we all know, can be a sincerely misguided piece of equipment."
A microwave burrito of a movie: You’ll eat it while wondering why.
Two pounds of story flopping around in a 10-pound bag.
"Devoted fans of the HBO series (2004-2011) will find it passably engaging, and newcomers will likely stare at the inside-Hollywood tropes and panic attacks the way Nipper the RCA dog stared at the Victrola."
A flimsy sentimental comedy with more product plugs and fewer laughs than might have been hoped for.
"Even with the presence of Johnny Depp can't save a dull and routine narrative that, in my opinion, burns like the blank pages of a book. [Full review in Spanish]"
"It's handsomely shot, but only fitfully entertaining."
"Believers and fans of uplifting, unashamedly emotional stories will enjoy this. Non-believers will struggle with the message and tone."
Denis' elliptical narrative avoids politics. This siege tale ignores the details of colonial life to gloss its chaotic collapse. Her equanimity is tiresome.
"This low-budget comedy will most likely try the patience of a paying audience with its uneven pacing, wavering tone and poor production quality."
"A Bad Moms Christmas is not an absolutely terrible movie, but it's just very uninspired."
"It can never seem to decide if it's escapist action or social commentary and, as a result, it never commits to either."
The Pang Brothers' The Eye and Gore Verbinski's The Ring were better remakes of Dark Water than this.
"The Life Before Her Eyes might offer a fresh perspective on aborted dreams, but its insights are buried under stale, inflated moviemaking."
The wildest thing about this movie is its faith that what kids (and parents) really want for Christmas is a Nutcracker version of the Final Solution.
The interior scenes fail to honor Simenon's whetted prose.
"Given its overall lack of excitement and smattering of mano-y-mano spectacle, Wild Card should really be called Mild Card."
"May be the fulfillment of Shyamalan's long-gestating dream, but it's a dreary downer for the audience-a portentous, self-indulgent dirge that limps its way to a feeble conclusion."
"Ultimately this Bait is, as its title gives away, just another decoy that'll take you away from more substantial fare in other waters."
"SIGN UP Instead of nurturing his kooky inventions the director keeps moving to the next one, with an absentminded 'quick, look over there!' approach channelling his inner Dory."
"A movie based on a lie. Within a year of the Springbok victory promoted by Eastwood as bringing whites and blacks together, the team was up to its old racist ways."
"They didn't bother to write it; you shouldn't bother to ""Watch"" it."
[Snyder] twists the brawn and battle into a cartoonish FX extravaganza with severed body parts and globules of blood flying across the screen.
"If Sagan is an underappreciated literary icon as the filmmakers imply, they've failed to restore her memory any glory with this underwhelming, uninspiring portrait."
"I hate to drag out that word again, but it's seriously needed here: pretentious."
"It's a small-scale premise for a movie and, given its wooden, dubbed dialogue (a supreme irony), it's an experience purely for Callas fans."
The problem is Mendes’s inherent shallowness -- he’s the British Mike Nichols.
The result is a mindless popcorn movie that speeds frantically for almost as long as the real runaway train before grinding to an anticlimactic stop.
... this humorless film as unimaginative -- and as exhausting -- as you can get.
"When Peter actively rebels and is ironically rewarded for his efforts by the head honchos, the picture loses its bite -- what began as discomfiting satire soon devolves into silly farce."
"It's a triumph of streamlined design, but TRON: Legacy never enters the fourth dimension where it's worth a plugged nickel to humans."
"It's just too contrived, at its most banal when it thinks it's being profound, and it doesn't add up on any real level."
Run in fright.
"The chemistry between Smulders and Bean is simply terrific. Their performances almost save the film from its earnest, if bumbling, attempts to make a statement about the social, economic, and racial differences that divide the two characters."
A disappointing return to the iconic franchise with a spinoff that does not have many findings. [Full Review in Spanish]
A film so confused it honestly doesn't even know if it's a prequel or a sequel.
"Missing the operatic sense of doom that helped characterize 1995's Seven, Zodiac's effort to avoid sensationalism conversely becomes disrespectfully unemotive."
"As encouraging as it is to see a religious movie that doesn't turn on an alternately cloying and fiery insistence that miracles, heaven, and/or God do factually exist, it's hard not to wonder how much there really is to Last Days In The Desert."
This low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the Farrelly brothers' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time.
Pieces of a Woman...communicates little in the way of psychological or emotional acuity. What remains instead is a film troubled by its unfulfilled possibility.
"We're waiting for this pressure cooker of a scenario to go nuclear and spill gunk all over the pretty, expensive stuff. It never quite happens and, for all the actors' impeccable restraint, something is missing."
"It's a very August sort of movie, the kind that benefits from low, lax expectations."
I could identify the mole in 'The Sentinel' the first time he appeared on camera. Don't you hate it when that happens in a movie?
"A comic-tragic-sentimental genre hodgepodge that wants to make you feel all the feelings amid all that action spectacle. It doesn't entirely deliver, but at times you can't help but admire its strangeness."
"Racism, parental dependence, heartbreak and police abuse are the issues American Son addresses in its hour and a half. But what may seem little... can be a lot if there is no rhythm and the dialogues are cumbersome. [Full review in Spanish]"
It's impressive to live in a day and age where comic movies can still be this bad. 
"The Blakes are hardly sympathetic figures, so when their lives are threatened, I began to silently root for their demise, if it promised to hasten the movie's end."
"Even masters have their off days ... and Dante's new picture, ""Burying The Ex,"" seems to have been made over the course of quite a few of them."
Disenchanted starts with promise but largely drops those interesting threads when the over-the-top action really kicks off&#46;
"An exercise in muddy, moody subjectivity."
"The movie isn't without its entertainment value -- of the sillier kind, which in the cases of Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy may be intentional."
It's so sterile and clinical and emotionless that making a film about the emotionlessness of sex has become more of a cliche than just good ole Cinemax softcore porn.
"The Benchwarmers is full of potty humor and worse, but this ""make work"" program for The Friends of Adam Sandler is not a dreadful movie, it's just an inconsequential one"
"Perhaps Ledger's death tore the heart right out of the film, or maybe Gilliam just can't quit his addiction to discomfort. Though it promises something fanciful at times, Parnassus"" can be disappointingly moody."
I wish the movie kind of caught fire for me.
"For a film that reminds use over and over that this is a whole new world, this movie feels awfully familiar."

The film was cast wrong and written shallowly.
So-so.
"Although the film seems very proud of its clever gender bending ""twist,"" there's really nothing fresh about Made of Honor. It's a one-gag movie that wears out its gag well before the halfway mark."
"While Shue makes a more credible scientist here than she did in The Saint, it's still a stretch to see her in a role that isn't either a prostitute or a babysitter."
A heartfelt examination of confusion and shame&#44; but it&#8217;s a lousy genre offering&#46;
Only the baby actors are spontaneous.
"Despite the exhausting quest taken up by the documentary's hero, the film doesn't register as inspirational."
Truly lame dialogue.

The major accomplishments of The Revenant are its extraordinary cinematography and its ability to try our patience.
"The exquisitely talented Moore, obviously uncomfortable with rapid-fire banter, should sue director Peter Howitt for an annulment, on the grounds of nonsupport."
"Carol Fuchs's silly, mushy script has her character swerve without warning between obtuse rigidity and sweet normality."
"There are so many moments in Happiness of the Katakuris that beg us to walk out on the movie, it's hard to pick just one."
"The use of archival footage is both expertly and ineptly done, the descriptions of the nation's reaction just doesn't play true [no one really cares that much-not even President Cheney]."
A grisly carnival of poorly executed and just bad ideas. It's difficult to count the ways in which House of Gucci is undeserving of your time.
As yawn-inducing as most of his live-action brethren.
"Where [writer/director Joel] Potrykus goes awry is in the undeveloped nature of his own script, which becomes very slack in the film's second half."

Stay away!
"The climax, which involves the homecoming dance and a death ray, is frenzied in its effort to entertain, yet ultimately underwhelming, much like the movie as a whole."
"Perhaps the irony of The Film Critic is that, while its protagonist seems desperately, vehemently against clich, the film itself waltzes into a forest of them almost with aplomb."
... why would you intentionally take a subject this difficult to show and make it into a film this difficult to watch?
"Irritating, faux-edgy, tonally wack, strained, unfunny, and such a colossally tone-deaf misfire"
"Amid the swamp of crude humor and self-conscious parody, the biggest problem ... is that it has more uplifting messages than a very special episode of Blossom."
Too much of the movie feels predestined---down to the rainstorm on opening day---and subplots involving budding romance end up forcing what's implicit.
Vince Vaughn commits rampant acts of comic zeal while the script around him crumbles in a movie that loses its thrust like a cat caught in traffic.
"When it comes to characters, story and personality, though, the movie's as thin as a wisp of brightly colored hair..."

Audiences may not get too excited about devastated people who conduct their social lives at the local Dairy Queen.
"Considering the narrative rope-a-dope in the first act, including a confusing and needless framing device that makes the film feel like a victim of post-production tinkering, it is occasionally entertaining and occasionally engrossing despite itself."
Schematic and unconvincing.
"Those that have been to France might enjoy the look of the food and the scenic landscapes but for those after a character-driven drama, Paris Can Wait comes up empty."
"Because of the lack of depth in supporting characters and half-baked writing, this movie couldn't have ended fast enough."
"Lautner seems perfectly capable of playing a three-dimensional character who can also, as it happens, kick butt, but you'd never know it from Abduction."
"An unnecessary remake? judged by the end result. it's hard to tell what motivated Irwin Winkler, a poor director, to redo the Jules Dassin noir classic of the 1940s; perhaps the opportunity to work with De Niro and Jessica Lange, though neither is good"
"If you parse its time-travel paradoxes for even a minute or two, the whole movie falls apart. But if you're the kind of person who likes this kind of thing, here it is."
...ultimately reduced to a barrage of unintentionally hilarious one-liners.
"Tries to be as wholesome as Ward Cleaver, but is about as sincere as Eddie Haskell."
"Cop Land is a movie that seems to have either too many subplots or not enough editing. It is either way too long or too short, depending on what it was meant to be in the first place."
Black Adam is a two-hour-long diversion &#8211; things explode&#44; or get punched&#44; we get the classic Johnson smirk&#44; and nothing changes&#46; Maybe that&#8217;s how people want it&#46; But not me&#46;
Probably the darkest movie ever made with endless scenes in shadowy rooms.
Harden's Mrs. Carmondy would bring the whole production down if it weren't already flawed for other reasons.
"While The Wolfman has some really proud moments, ultimately it feels like a Franken-film... In short, when the Wolf Man wasn't ripping off people's heads -- it was unbearably boring."
"Any warm feeling toward the counterculture is tainted by an air of smugness, like tear gas wafting through a peace rally."
"It's a cinematic comic book, shallow, silly, filled with stunts and action, without much human interest."

No amount of catchy music&#44; production polish and star wattage can camouflage skin-and-bones writing&#46; Gold plating&#44; after all&#44; is just that &#8211; plating&#46;
"To coin an anagram, ""exploit nuance and battle forge"" - that is, unexceptional and forgettable."
"The film works best when it lampoons the opportunism of politicians, portraying extreme governmental policies with dystopian weight."
Terrace pretends to be about the persecution of a mixed-race couple when really it's about how anyone might react living next door to the shark from Jaws.
A movie about a gospel music competition should be fun and inspiring; Joyful Noise is lumbering and dull.
Calling Extreme Makeover: HE. Your intervention is sorely needed at this disastrous would-be horror movie...from the same folks who gave you the awful Thr3e.
Collapses in a heavy-breathing marriage of irony and unearned sentiment.

The first two-thirds seem jumbled and underdeveloped.
Kahlil Joseph's concert film profile of Arcade Fire is a disorganized mishmash.
"The last third of the film, as it stuffs more and more in, feels less like a movie and more like cramming for a history exam at 2 a.m."
"The first movie was good-hearted and I liked it, but since then Babe has raised the bar, with animals that not only talk more realistically, but say things that are wittier and more pungent."
"By no means a great -- or even a particularly good -- movie, but its sustained nastiness shows a stunning disregard for box-office niceties."
A movie of half measures and near-misses.
"Falls quite short of its mark, mostly due to the poor casting as well as a deathly slow pace that far too often veers away from [the film's] greatest strength, which is the music."
Sidney Poitier is the FBI deputy director and the only one in the cast to lend this movie credibility. 
"I cannot in good conscience, however, recommend that anyone, man, woman or child-pay money to see this film, as being forced to sit in a cinema for the film's 2-hour and 30-minute runtime was devastatingly exhausting."
It doesn't give us any more insight into what drove this phenomenally talented young woman to self- destruct at such a young age.
"The movie does get under your skin, but the way it has been put together reminds me of those animal shows where the crew nudges the gazelles in the direction of the lions with multiple cameras standing by."
Ultimately undercut by its fictional elements and its flat characters.
"Marriages can, do, and in certain cases ought to end, and bravo to [Noah] Baumbach for his candor in examining his own. But just as some matrimonial ties should be severed, so too should Marriage Story have pared down its fussy indulgences."
"Though certainly well-intentioned, Summering marks another disappointing effort from the talented James Ponsoldt, awkwardly colliding a coming-of-age drama with a grim detective story."
It's as much a triumph of boyish wish fulfillment as Peter Parker swinging on skyscrapers.
"Instead of breaking new ground, Emmerich seems to be revisiting bits from his glory days, down to daring escapes in a spacecraft. The first time around, they were a blast. This time, they're a bore. "
"Its attractive cast are game for the loose material, but the script is so off-kilter that it fails to connect credibly with the viewer."
Is it fun? Sort of. But it shoulda coulda been a ton of fun.
"So much emphasis is put on pratfalling that it leaves the sensitive moments completely stranded, unable to make themselves felt for fear they may get a punch in the mouth."
"An unfunny, manipulative romance about two unlikable people and their prop of a son, the pic mangles the premise of its source material."
... might be viewed as a symptom of a Hollywood system in which women of a certain age are devalued and ignored.
"Blank screamers, fastidiously amplified ""boos,"" and the most confused intimations of lesbianism since High Tension"
"Rather than making a movie some people might love, Abrams tried to make a movie no one would hate, and as a result, you don't feel much of anything at all."
White is clearly a keen observer of human behavior but he chose the wrong subject.
More heart-tugging mlo than spooky thriller.
"May be one of the blandest, mushiest non-rom-com films of the year."
Whatever were they smoking?
"Wolf Creek is a well-made film, but its technical merits are overwhelmed by the disgust registered as it wallows in some of the nastiest human behavior imaginable."
"Bright takes a bunch of gobbledygook from The Lord of the Rings, liquefies it in a blender and pours it liberally over the same ""corrupt cop comes to a moral crossroads"" blueprint that Ayer has been copying since Training Day."
"The film should have come across as a profound stand for liberty, not the petty grievance between selfish people devoid of scruples we eventually receive."
"Apart from a truly absurd script, director Tate Taylor's film performs ungainly political gyrations -- asking us to root against a survivor of sexual abuse and humiliation for trying to gain (albeit misplaced) revenge on her attacker."
"[I]t's not a story. It's a quirky Hallmark card... A story needs conflict; even a comedy, which this nominally is, needs drama. And there isn't any here."
It's disappointing to watch the continuing fall of director William Friedkin.
"This movie's veneer of knowing slickness is more than canceled out by a thick, fatty layer of stupidity."
...essentially a pile of contrivances supporting science fiction concepts we've seen before and a moral question it neatly sidesteps.
"The movie epitomizes the problems inherent in attempting to depict new (and constantly morphing) media -- the inevitable obsolescence, the intangible particularities that resist or get lost in translation."
"Say what you will about Bugs Bunny, at least he never needed a backstory."
A long slog through familiar elements of current action-blockbuster filmmaking.
"Warhol's statement was just a one-liner, and a movie requires more than that to run two hours."
"Costner delivers black-and-white simplifications -- the unequivocally right, justified in doing whatever they want against the demonized wrong. It's a film for the George W. Bush era."
The fatal flaw ... is its refusal to examine Angelina's occupation from outside the bubble. You might even call it a recruitment film.
Angrezi Medium is such a shabby non-starter of a movie that it's difficult to imagine so much talent amounting to almost nothing.
"The film is little more than a foundation for Parker Posey's usual fine performance, as the story lacks wit and narrative drive."
Avoid!
It's OK to write comedies about morons%u2026as long as you don't insult the intelligence of the audience in the script.
While I didn't like Playing with Fire the kids in the audience did. Maybe that's enough.
"Exorbitantly MTV-ish with its slick pacing, utter lack of depth and frequent, mindless outbursts of euphoria for mere euphoria's sake."
"It is time that Victor buries the hatchet once and for all, and gets out while he is ahead - or at least not totally behind."
...a promising yet half-baked endeavor that surely would've worked better as a short.
"...for the uninitiated, the story meanders far too much to resonate, and Altman's relentless focus on mortality dampens the show's amiable charm."
"Still, if you're a fan of Ice Cube you shouldn't be too disappointed. More, if you're a fan of Morgan you'll probably be downright pleased. Me, I'm neither here nor there about the darn thing."
"Its story is a familiar one, whatever the decade."
Many of the children whose faces are shown in the film were shot as they looked at video games; their expressions suggest that whatever they were watching was a lot more fascinating than this.
"Even though Hide and Seek's chilling tag phrase--""Come out, come out, wherever you are!""--may be enticing, just stay right where you are."
Too much of this feels as if Giannoli is circling around the same points over and over again...
"You can detect a flicker - one might even say a ghost - of an interesting idea beneath its polished shell. But at every turn, Ghost in the Shell sacrifices the opportunity to actually say something interesting."
Vengeance proves more technically impressive than truly gripping.
"excepting experimental films, plot is a key reason we watch movies. Without an interesting one, an hour and a half of competent filmmaking becomes about an hour and 25 minutes of boredom."
I'd take raw shots of sweat dripping on pavement and heavy panting over slick graphics and guitar-strumming any day.
"Does anyone really want to sit through the campaigning, scheming, and dissecting of fictional candidates when we're drowning in the minutiae of real ones? Especially with Costner?"
"There you have it, kids: all you need is love. Although loads of money and a good wi-fi signal definitely help."
"Despite a cast that includes six former Oscar nominees (and two winners), Collateral Beauty is essentially a rich person's Hallmark Hall of Fame movie."
The movie is a black hole of failed ambition that mystifies on every level and offers zero payoff.
Feast of Love is a multi-layered -- layers of baloney -- tale of pursuit of love.
"Through its first two-thirds, at least, Hide and Seek does a good enough job of piquing our curiosity that the movie's ultimate dumbness is more than a minor insult."
A visual and magical delight that isn't enough to be enchanting for all muggles; It doesn't petrify emotions as a good spell. [Full review in Spanish]
Sin City has been made with such scrupulous care and obvious love for its genre influences that it's a shame the movie is kind of a bore.
A sour and pointless exercise.
"This funnier, glossier Alfie is a mite too watered down. In the end, we're having so much fun we don't feel his soul-sickness. It's lightweight desolation."
Practically imperfect in every way.
"The film's PG-rating, even for the time period, is an almost tragic waste of Grier's action chops."
"An action-packed mess from its lackluster, two-pronged opening segments to its final showdown."
Tolkien's brisk story of intrepid little hobbit Bilbo Baggins is drawn out and diluted by dispensable trimmings better left for DVD extras.
"Wrong, wrong, wrong, every step of the way."
"The trouble with this third film in the franchise is that its messages are muddled: the premise changes, there is too much going on and the filmmakers have forgotten that we need to care about the characters"
The movie ultimately crushes itself in a vise of self-loathing&#46;
Mark my words: Mindhunters will do for psycho-thrillers what Showgirls did for stripper movies.
"Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau further damage their credibility (though not their bank balances) with another lazy, underwritten comedy."
"If it doesn't bother you that they speak terribly bad Spanish, including those who boast of having it as their native language, and that the drug trafficking is the main theme... you may at some point enjoy this irreverent comedy. [Full review in Spanish]"
The film rapidly degenerates into an Escape From Canary Wharf video game.
"All the broad humor of the original film is gone, replaced by clunky and often tasteless gags, and the attempts to extract pathos from genuine tragedies vary from tacky to insulting."
The film rarely manages to generate much in the way of suspense or terror.
"Sorkin never quite finds a way to tell a cohesive narrative within this jumble of ideas, characters, relationships, and intentions."
"The material feels stretched thin over feature length, and indeed, it was a short film first and should've stayed that way"
"Perhaps for someone who never saw The Blair Witch Project, this might represent an adequate scary movie."
"For all the affairs, the jealousy, the self-involvement and the obliviousness of some characters, these are lives in lower case..."
The writer-director's interest in desire and longing is habitually channeled through quirky-quick brushstrokes that reduce the already borderline-pretentious proceedings into full-blown treacle.
"There is exactly one idea in The Matrix Resurrections that feels new, fresh and exciting."
"Woods can't even bring herself to make Leah any worse than naive, if sometimes dangerously so, which makes White Girl less complex and sophisticated than an average episode of Girls."
Yet another princess story calculated to revive the public's cash-dispensing interest in that kneaded-to-death formula.
"Although the tone is dark comedy, it's tough to see where it's meant to be funny, even in a deadpan way."
A better title for M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening would be Nonsense. It's like an amusement park ride that has no reason for being -- and no meaning -- besides visceral excitation. Only difference is that The Happening isn't fun.
Myers has this unerringly creepy way of delivering punchlines straight to camera and laughing like a ninny. He does it too quickly - almost desperately - as if he knows the audience won't be chuckling once the joke is told.
"Back on planet Earth, we're still talking about a ridiculously infantile film, one that flatters itself by intimating a deeper comment about suppressed masculinity and romantic passivity. Nope."
"As a rule I'm a pushover for Oscar Wilde's brand of high-flown drollery. But A Good Woman, director Mike Barker's film version of Wilde's Lady Windermere's Fan, left me high, dry and grumpy."
[Winter's Tale] looks nice and goes down easy-and with a few hearty laughs for more cynical viewers-but has little narrative substance or emotional sustenance.
This lazily plotted and performed political snoozer has to be one of the most disappointing films I've seen all year.
"Sadly, there's so much going on in Big Sky that the spotlight is taken away from Hazel and she becomes a bit part in her own story."
"As if this weren't enough baggage for one movie, especially an indie movie, Radnor front-loads the proceedings with further complications."
..it pulls all the heart strings it can in a shameless attempt to get real emotions.
I hated Hot Tub Time Machine 2 so much I now can't even think about the first one without feeling annoyed.
"I found it rather comparable to a typical television sitcom, which isn't exactly a glowing recommendation."
"The structuring allegory's invocation of familial bonds and immigrant burdens grows stilted: It doesn't collapse this delicate film, but it can't quite hold it up, either."
"Despite a good opening section and some strong suspense sequences, No Escape is an ugly hearted and shamefully xenophobic B-movie directed with remorseless efficiency by brothers John Erick Dowdle and Drew Dowdle."
There's just enough cleverness in Escape Room to enjoy that this bad-horror-movie experience becomes more discouraging than droll.
An epic snuff flick which fails to engage the viewer on an emotional level.
"It's an arresting piece of work, but it's also disordered and shapeless."
"Jeremy Garelick has a clever title and an amusing premise, and the movie benefits from the teaming of Hart and Gad. But the picture suffers from Garelick's inept direction."
"Hoax or no, the narrative can't escape death by a thousand newfangled iMac cuts."
...may well have the most asinine plot in the history of cinema.
It feels like every time the movie gets close to uncovering something that may feel authentic it shies away and goes for a Hollywood cliché instead.
Sandra Bullock is lucky to have a career after this...
a gale force of energy and creativity in the service of a lame idea
The movie is simply too much.
Superficial and unsatisfying...
"As a lousy mystery and lousier romantic comedy, The Bounty Hunter is two bad films in one."
"Unfortunately, while Black's assembled all the parts, he's not locked in the conflict early enough, and the good scenes simply aren't enough good to make up for the plot's too-late lock."
"There isn't much here, and what there is is awfully easy."
"If the characters in The Last Kiss come across as a bit too whiny, it's not because they're too young, but rather because they're too self-inflated."
"I've always believed Nick Hornby books make for better movies. Here, a Nick Hornby screenplay was probably better left as someone else's book."
"The characters are one-dimensional and surprisingly shallow, the film is unpleasantly predictable, and the realism factor here is You've gotta be kidding."
The problem is self-indulgence and a distinct shortage of real gags.
"Starts with a fine first hour, then dissolves with a twist ending that comes much too fast"
"Awful. Just awful. And while watching it, you get the distinct feeling that everyone involved with When The Bough Breaks knows it, too."
"Its third act is so hopelessly inept, I'd have preferred the writer/director just default to a ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" ending, unceremoniously wrapping the film mid-scene..."
Here's a sentence I'm just incredibly sad to type: Alien: Covenant is bad.
There are many other dull and naughty characters in this brisk whirl on the Washington merry-go-round.
"What lets Eiffel down, as ironic as it sounds is the love story. It feels a bit contrived. Lovely as it is, I could have done with less of it and more about the man and his buildings."
"Costner gives one of his strongest performances in recent years, but the effort is for naught in a film that ultimately doesn't have the courage to deal honestly with the issues it raises."
"How Ben Hozie approaches sexual professionalism is not the problem. To put it lightly, it's just about everything else on-screen."
"[Warwick] Thornton is exceptionally skilled at intertwining genre, formal innovation, and political revisionism; what finally undermines Sweet Country is that his skill does not extend to more fully depicting Aboriginal women."
"Much of the dialogue is scatological humor that's leadenly unfunny, like a professor reading out loud from ""Tristam Shandy."""
"If you would rather spare yourself the torture of having the image of the legendary, Oscar-winning actor tarnished for good, then you are advised to look for your dirty laughs elsewhere."
"Not even Stoppard is Shakespeare, and the end result resembles one of Neil Simon's middlebrow romps more than it does As You Like It."
"""The reverential film will not change the minds of either believers or doubters."
"An ever sprawlier, messier, talkier affair."
Always is one of the more serious Spielberg films in the 1980s films but among the worst films in his entire filmography.
"Ambitious but only partially successful, this British character drama belongs in the 'curate's egg' bracket."
"The Burning Plain is missing a surprising and compelling story that packs an emotional punch, so Arriaga uses his signature style to distract you in the same way a magician would use the old sleight of hand practice."
There's no moment during this true-life Little Codger That Could tale that doesn't drip with unabashedly calculated schmaltz.
The script prepared by Mr. Huston and Richard Brooks was too full of words and highly cross-purposed implications to give the action full chance.
"The Nutcracker and the Four Realms doubles down on CGI, bright colors, and clichéd storytelling"
A very bad movie.
"There's no sense of wonder in this frantic tour of wonderland, and Lyra escapes trouble so easily, there's little suspense."
"As a body-switching flick the pic offers some decently inspired moments. But the rest feels like the sort of video game you might begin playing, but quickly grow bored by it. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
It never made me believe for a sec it was not nonsensical or had much to say that meant something.
"The bigger his thematic ambition, the more Shyamalan seems to lose control. If Sarah Paulson's Dr. Staple is looking for a character with delusions of grandeur in this film, she might not have to look further than the director himself."
"Continuing the sad slump in Atom Egoyan's career after last year's The Captive, this plodding new drama is perhaps a shade or two less risible."
The laughs ultimately take a backseat to a convoluted white-collar crime story.
"Costa-Gavras' political thrillers used to jab and thrust with lethal efficiency. This one just pounds against a heavy bag, huffing and puffing all the way."
"Ozon, for all the prettiness of his comic and visual grace notes, runs out of ideas."
The result of what would appear to be a great deal of effort and some horribly misguided conviction is an extremely slow-moving train wreck.
"Running Scared will probably play best in prisons, where lowlifes, applauding the heroic amounts of foul language and blood, will be heartened to know that society has finally stooped to their level."
"So, here's the deal. Don't send us any more Chandni Chowk movies, and we won't send you anything with Adam Sandler."
"""...bring a container of aspirin to the theater and pop the cap far before the lights dim."""
An increasingly idiotic picture that could easily have been titled Dumb and Dumber had that moniker not been snapped up nearly two decades ago.
"""Minions"" does feature a ""groovy"" soundtrack, but it's not enough to overcome the movie's lesser elements."
"The premise and performers yield some emotional moments, inadvertently heightened by recent events. Yet as a whole, the film never quite takes wing."
There’s such little meat on the bone here plot-wise that it feels like everyone involved in the production got a checklist of beats that the studio wanted to hit and did their best to make that all that they did.
[Clark's] leering treatment of teenage flesh is likely to call forth even the biggest libertine's inner prude.
"The only reason to see Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within is to gaze in amazement at what the future of film may hold. It's not a particularly good movie, but it's a movie that may change the movies."
"If this film aspires to be a cinematic Lord of the Flies, its showiness and intellectual hypocrisy make it something far less in practice."
"A dull, listless, derivative chunk of celluloid lacking any spark or even basic storytelling ability."
Mmindless and senseless.
"Let's be honest: If you're asking the Rock to do voices, you're out of ideas."
"To get to the final message about What Really Matters we are required to sit through the sensational whoop-de-do of the big game, which seems to go on for an eternity."
"The movie is an ugly, self-indulgent, pretentious exercise masquerading as artistic and insightful filmmaking."
"It's a credit to the British director that he's captured so much regional and class detail, but disappointing that his film's conclusions are almost banal, with a contrived finale that ties too many threads together."
"McDonagh uses advertising as a metaphor for aggravated communication, as apparent in our media and social relations, but, regrettably, it's also a foreigner's careless simplification of America's current unease."
There are only so many clever gags the filmmakers can include before it becomes obvious they're trying to cover up holes of their own making.
This handsomely mounted biopic is an overall muddled depiction of a critical period in European history.
...sweet-as-Splenda Garry Marshall pipedream...
An overstuffed fantasia.
"The tone is stillborn and static when it should be ominous and engrossing. The characters fail to connect with the audience. This is a cold, distant, and off-putting motion picture that generates little in the way of tension or suspense."
"While it's intermittently amusing, none of this was appointment television to begin with, so it's hard to imagine big crowds shelling out for it at the multiplex."
"The Protégé sucks the fun and excitement out of its action-thriller premise, and it turns its gorgeous, incredible actors into charisma black holes. Everyone involved not only deserves better, but has done better versions of what they do here."
Want to see lots of barf scenes? How about tons of references to genitalia? What about several poop-focused jokes?
'Over Her Dead Body' is a supernatural romantic comedy that's guaranteed to make viewers loose their faith in love in this world or the next.
"From a helicopter's point-of-view, The Rock is just typical big American dumb fun. It's only when you look underneath at the film's underlying assumptions that you want to recoil."
"Of course, these things sing on the strength of the ensemble, but for all the films two-hour runtime, no one really gets to shine."
"a shallow, cliched biopic treatment from...Jalil Lespert. Niney is incredibly well matched physically to Saint Laurent but it is Gallienne who creates the more memorable character here"
...wannabe mob sons in a hick town milling around-buying beers and showing off their leather jackets.
"Much like its frazzled protagonist, 6 Balloons has a strong sense of direction, but the film is too constricted to let go, embrace the detours, and allow life to takes it course."
"Released the week of the Ferguson shooting, the film seemed poised to probe the raw nerves of America's love-hate relationship with law enforcement. Unfortunately, the spoofery of police power soon gives way to formula comedy and be-all-you-can-be uplift."
"This soft, languid road movie benefits from accomplished actors Mirren and Sutherland; they share a genuine chemistry, but despite some lovely moments, the film meanders and becomes lost."
"Like Norbit, Kickin' It Old Skool is a film unable to provide its charmingly stupid characters with the movie they truly deserve."
"This too-languidly-paced film lacks the emotional payoff of The Lunchbox, and rising newcomer Malhotra is not yet in Siddiqui's league."
"The movie has a nice look -- gray, rusted metal exposed to Siberian and Bering Strait snow. What it lacks is coherence and a compelling reason for us to take this often-abrupt journey with Aurora, Toorop and Sister Rebeka."
"Tenet is all action all the time, sacrificing heart and clarity for spectacle."
"Another heaping helping of middlebrow mush from Nicholas Sparks, the modern-day version of Fannie Hurst."
A sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like The Ghost and Mr. Chicken.
Too many gremlins and not enough story line.
The film was so phony that not even the drag queens looked real.
both the behavior of the characters and the viewer responses sought are so repetitive and unchanging that it all becomes wearisome well before the far overlong feature wraps up.
"McConaughey too once showed promise, but here he seems to be auditioning for a bad sitcom, while Garner misuses her gawky sincerity."
"Wimps out by going for that PG-13 rating, so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted."
"It's a movie made for a syllabus, not to entertain."
"Even those sympathetic to the picture's cause will recognize it as a case of shoddy journalism, not so much due to its partisan mind-set but because it lacks clarity and revelation."
"Horror aficionados may appreciate some of its stagings and detail, but for anyone seeking more than just meaningless blood and guts being spewed there's no reason to give I Saw the Devil a look."
Can't invest its characters with enough reason to be in either its own future or the future inside its future.
A movie that left me as cold as the snowman's grin.
Students beware: This is no sub for Cliffs Notes. The script takes more liberties with the text than Elizabeth Berkley did with that pole in Showgirls.
"As a longtime admirer of the director's work, I can't quite believe I'm saying this, but the most shocking thing I found about The House That Jack Built is how tedious it is."
"While in theory it all sounds very interesting and intriguing and, well, Godardian, the whole never really comes together"
Parental Content Review
Radnor's script takes some dips toward the cloyingly cute.
You should know that the film's incomprehensible bits are complemented by much incomprehensible blather.
"Unsuccessfully attempts to fashion an actual story out of slapdash, seemingly improvised sequences awash in uneven CG effects."
"It's very beautiful, but it's so contrived."
For all of the film's high-minded aspirations it's just too silly and stupid to be able to live up to any of them.
The Menu starts off intriguing&#44; but eventually gets too bogged down becoming the very thing it&#8217;s spoofing&#46;
Surely Owen Wilson can do a lot better than a slipshod animation about time travelling turkeys?
This overwrought and underdeveloped psychological thriller with heavy-handed political implications adds up to exactly nothing.
Perhaps writer-director Roland Emmerich was hoping for a so-bad-it's-good cult status with his latest disaster flick.
"Hazanavicius has confused sobriety with impact, and mulched down all the stories you might want to tell about Chechnya into a generic, undermotivated wallow."
This interminable farrago feels like swimming through a sea of excrement.
"This overly twee, morbidly cute romance initially digs up the ageless ""Harold and Maude"" as a touchstone before it slips the coils of watchability."
Ellis seems to believe that artists have an enlightened sense of beauty and greater access to it than common folk. And he may be right: He's clearly mastered the skill of convincing art-school chicks to take their clothes off.
"In the cinema, all of us tough, cynical critics had tears welling in our eyes, swallowing hard; our lips, so often curled in a cheap sneer, were now trembling, because of the same desperately sad thought: ""Owen Wilson used to be really good..."""
The new Fantastic Four might have been palatable if we hadn't already met a certain wall crawler or Caped Crusader on screen.
"[Not] very amusing--its stabs at humor are low-key to a fault, and too sporadic--but it is mostly truthful about yuppie love, and that's something."
a minor message at best.
"A hijacked airliner action-thriller with a relentless pace and 10 or so potential villains, Non-Stop is nearly unstoppable fun -- until the killjoy of its big villain reveal."
"The thudding, obvious symbolism is the film's biggest concern and its primary problem."
Stiller and Wilson look bewildered.
Isn't there some little corner of Hollywood that still believes in the sweet and charming?
"Not just confusing, predictable and mis-sold as a feminist film, the calamity that is Jane Got A Gun is hobbled by the dullest of plots."
"By adhering to ""realism"", though, Clifford the Big Red Dog continually calls attention to its title character's artificiality."
"[Not] just a weaker movie than all three of its predecessors, it's a movie that straight up does not work in any way."
Well intentioned yet utterly dull...
"Like many rodents, the plot runs in circles, covering over and over again the same ground...[Plus,] Psy, who parties like it's 2012."
"It's Watts who keeps this movie interesting enough to maintain our investment, wallowing in June's sadness, fear, and anxiety..."
Stacie Passon's drama is like Luis Buuel's Belle de Jour without much of the humour or surrealism.
"A movie should be fun, this isn't."
It's sad to see a beautiful mind whittled down by such a plain one.
"The real problem is that the movie doesn't have much of a point of view on anything, apart from the fact that harassment is bad."
This new Massacre wants to be the new Halloween so badly it might as well be wearing a mask made from Jamie Lee Curtis’ face.
The film plods along as slowly as a funeral procession on Therozine.
Soderbergh does (Gray) no favors with a series of overwrought stylistic choices.
The biggest disappointment of the summer movie season.
"Hellraiser: Judgment does not entirely work as a movie. It's a mixed bag, with the stuff I enjoyed ultimately outweighed by the stuff I did not. But it comes so close to breaking even."
Tame gags are about all the film has to offer.
Josephine Decker&apos;s experimental direction offers some stunning visuals&#44; but they often feel at odds with Jandy Nelson&apos;s more grounded meditation on grief&#46; And while Kaufman is charming&#44; there&apos;s no chemistry among any of the characters in the love triangle
"And the award for Best Actor in a Disappointing Movie goes to... Benedict Cumberbatch as Julian Assange in ""The Fifth Estate."""
"Mohenjo Daro is a well-made film, just not very well thought out."
"The problem with Keeping Mum is that the slaughter is very real and, worse, the victims are often innocent or otherwise undeserving of their fate."
"Unfortunately Mr. Fraser comes off as a forlorn, outsize Pee Wee Herman."
"It's a shame that ""The Sentinel"" wastes its intelligent façade, because with all the unthrilling thrillers that have come and gone from movie screens, this one might have been worth something."
An exceptional Italian film becomes an average American one in this bland remake.
"Veteran actor Jeffrey Wright gives the only spot-on performance, but even he can't save a silly storyline from itself."
"Strange how dreary it all is, and how tired Fraser seems."
The people in this movie are some of the stupidest people in the history of movies.
Saga is especially sapped of its appeal and energy by the toxically charmless titular character whose central obsession -- dressing up like Stevie Nicks and singing her material -- is curiously wedged between comedy and oddity.
"The first time we see Ben Affleck as Daredevil, he's high atop a church in Manhattan, looking beaten, bruised and woozy in the sort of lipstick-red leather bondage gear you'd expect to find on a cross-dresser..."
Renny Harlin drives this film into the ground.
All attempts at non-effects storytelling fall completely flat.
Inconsistencies in tone are minor when compared to the confusion created by the editor's butchery.
There&#8217;s a real crisis of imagination in studio animated features&#44; and the minions are the prime example of an uninspired property that exists merely to churn out mindless content&#46; 
"That it is harmless entertainment for the youngsters is fine, but don't confuse this with quality entertainment."
"The long-delayed ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" finally has been released into the end-of-summer Sargasso Sea of lost films where it will probably be quickly forgotten."
"It peaks way before the movie's over. You're caught in a slow but steady decline, an unwanted comedown."
It's a movie that only sci-fi nerds are going to enjoy.
"Remember Hide and Seek? Yeah, the twist is that obvious."
"Insistently -- and constrictedly -- pocket-size, an adventure for families who've decided on local travel for their next vacation."
Partially entertaining but insubstantial. [Full review in Spanish]
Almost two hours is much too long for all this.
“Memory” has the most ironic title in the Neeson canon because it feels like a recollection of every cliché the great actor has solidified in his career as a gun-wielding tough guy.
Doesn't live up to its truly inspired title.
Two central performances that are entirely better than the script deserves are the only thing keeping the movie from floating right off the screen and dissolving in mid-air.
"Throughout, one character refers to the new RoboCop as 'Tin Man' and to the film's credit, it desperately wants to have a heart. Oh, if it only had a brain."
Fraser does his Mummy best to save us from the true disaster--the script.
"Although he's the darling of many critics, I still don't understand the fascination with David Gordon Green and his films."
Mortal Engines marshals billions of pixels and barely an iota of inspiration.
Instantly forgettable thanks to a mediocre screenplay.
The movie would be a hoot if it didn't drag on for two and a half hours and feature witches who talk so much that Hansel and Gretel would fling themselves into the oven to get it over with.
...a rather ludicrous premise that's employed to persistently underwhelming effect by writer/director James DeMonaco...
"Gigli certainly isn't the worst film of the year, as it has been made out to be, but it does make one wonder if the lynch mob mentality against certain cinematic endeavors isn't at least a little deserved."
"As a straight-up erotic thriller, In the Cut is too self-possessed, scattered and moody to function."
It's not that being privileged makes them boring; being two-dimensional does.
"The story falters when it runs through its very traditional, even hackneyed arcs ..."
"the conclusion comes across as tacked-on, padded to get the thing to feature length. That's an unfortunate way to wrap up an otherwise sweet little movie."
Dugan takes many wrong turns and ends up in Boston with a duck-boat load of one-dimensional characters and a suitcase of outdated jokes.
"Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin joins the group to remind us that this is no longer the franchise we remember. No, unfortunately, that's long dead."
"Just an Alien knockoff, albeit a serviceable one."
"Even with Nickelodeon's cross-pollination efforts and the dazzling Oderama concept, the 12-year-old babies just aren't funny this time."
"""Tag"" is one of those movies that's better than you'd think. But you'd think it's flat-out awful, so don't get your hopes up too much."
'No one was expecting Remains of the Day but this film could have been more than just a Dawson's Creek stop gap.'
"Neither horror film, spoof, nor social commentary, 'The Skin I Live In' wanders in limbo, unsure of what its own essence is."
"The concept behind Frailty is terrifying, but the ending ruins the movie"
"There's such a gaping discontinuity between her physical beauty and her vacant, gum-snapping personality that she's like a walking advertisement for everything that's right and wrong with America."
(Tom) Dey's erratic cuts disrupt the momentum as he rushes to get to the next easy physical gag.
"Predictable, corny, schmaltzy, inane, unfunny, flat, sentimental and utterly fatuous. Most of the acting is bad, and none of the characters are interesting. Watching it is about as culturally rewarding as actually getting drunk, and less fun."
"Navigating halfway between blatantly bonkers and bitingly brilliant, The Shallows sadly got stranded in beautiful but bush-league."
"There's a lot of screaming and carrying on (this is, remember, a movie containing Russian gangsters), but there's a curious absence of weight to the performances."
More offensive than the poor humor and bad acting...is the cheap arm-twisting created by making this film serve double duty as a promotional piece [for the Special Olympics].
"So much movie, I think my engorged eyeballs had to stick a finger down their throats and vomit out a couple of epic battle scenes just so they could get through the finale."
Just how many stupid mistakes and dumb decisions will a father make to protect his family&#46; Unfortunately&#44; from Beast&#44; we get the answer
"[Roland Emmerich] again wipes out enormous swaths of humanity and real estate, but this time the overall tone is funereal, sober."
"The sequel is a live-action Road Runner cartoon, which is a criticism to the degree that you think story, characterization and some fidelity to the laws of gravity are important."
Rather predictable and afflicted with dashes of rather heavily Teutonic whimsy.
Far too purified of human struggle to be deeply felt
The story is just told very poorly... what is this movie? A thriller? A ghost story? A police procedural? A tearjerker? It's all of those and none of them.
"While in its romantic and romanticized particulars, this A Star Is Born can often seem silly, hoary, disjointed or meandering, the essence of the showbiz narrative still exerts a powerful pull... [Blu-ray]"
"The dream fulfillment seems more silly than romantic, and it brings the movie to an abrupt end that is wholly unsatisfying."
"Dreary, misconceived movie about a man redeemed by the love of a child."
"It has all the right beats, but falters in the end. Maybe the book is better. It might be better to read than to have seen."
A bland B-movie that begs the question: How did this get made when so many good films never escape development purgatory?
"This is a sloppily made film, imitative of the smoother made The Parallax View."
A lack of empathetic characters cripples this poorly paced but well acted drama about an Iranian family who purchase a city-auctioned bungalow in Northern California after its former tenant has been unjustly evicted.
"I really did want to love it, but I just can't."
As a society we must stop kink-shaming the Hell Priest&#44; Pinhead&#44; but as a critic I have some complaints with their latest movie&#46;
Unfortunately we're not in the business of thumbing up films with a couple of gags
"A formulaic sisters-are-doing-it-for-themselves (and doing each other's hair) ensemble drama in the manner of 'Beauty Shop,' elevated by the novelty of its Lebanese locations and Arabic cast..."
"Although intriguing, the film is way too long and is narratively all over the map, varying from a fictionalized documentary to an almost surreal soap opera."
Let the record show that neither tact nor timing are the strong suits of this so-so new action thriller. Bound to happen when you're a movie that gets its tension levels rising by blowing up civilians with terrorist-planted Semtex on the streets of Paris.
This movie is only remarkable in how underwhelming it is.
There's nothing really wrong with Till Human Voices Wake Us that some actual dramatic tension couldn't resolve.
"Stories about mythic figures at the end of their days are compelling - but they still need some zing. That's what ""Mr. Holmes"" is missing."
Maybe they should've sent a robot back in time to force Cameron and company to direct this film.
A movie with no heart or soul.
"T2: Trainspotting is unsurprisingly disappointing, even though a strong third act proves that it isn't a total waste of time."
It just doesn't leave much of an impression.
"[Steve] Antin hasn't really written Burlesque, he has merely spooned the story out of a can labelled 'Instant Musical: Just add eyeliner.'"
"...every clear-eyed observation of how adult humans court affection must be pulped and sugared, refined into treacle."
"Shannon is superb at being contemptible and intense, tossing about vein-popping speeches that attempt to justify his immoral and regularly illegal approach to making money."
"By this time next year Shark Tale will be on a sale rack at Wal-Mart for $5.99, probably as part of a bargain double-pack with Ice Age."
"The semiserious comedy by director Sven Pape is in its own category, and unfortunately it's not always an interesting one."
"When Mapes' story about Bush airs, the film gives us a montage of all-walks-of-life Americans glued to their television sets, as if '60 Minutes Wednesday' were the Kennedy funeral."
The whole thing unravels like a long night of Trivial Pursuit.
"Regardless of Zhao's (and Marvel's) intentions, ""Eternals"" is a parade of faces without experience, a movie that reaches back and forth through history and comes back empty-handed."
"Q-bert terrified out of his mind, watches a child play The Last of Us, as Adam Sandler quips ""is this the most violent game you have ever seen"". Of course, the writers then ruin that goodwill built up by having him piss blocks"
"""Severance"" is just enough of an exploitation satire (think, Roger Corman in his heyday) to hold your interest beyond its gratuitous knife, blood and breast recipe for suspense and shock."
"Like most modern action films, Shooter is too explicit, more interested in mayhem than motive."
"Fairy tale sequel has tired jokes, tedious references."
"Director Todd Kalin seemed the perfect person to bring the Baekeland saga to the screen, and Julianne Moore the perfect person to play the demented and doomed Barbara. So what went wrong?"
Things get soft where they should be sharp and cozy instead of crazy.
"Based on actual photos the rovers continue to buzz back to planet Earth, the CGI landscapes are impressive but the camera maneuvers are ungodly."
Good direction isn't able to overcome a really bad script that feels like it was written by committee.
"Better than it probably deserves to be. When so many trilogies start strong and finish with a whimper, ""The Hangover"" movies set the bar very low to begin with, and then lower still, just so the only way to go for the finale would be up."
"Four stars to the subjects of this movie, and two stars to the way they have been boiled down into cute pictures and sound bites."
"If you have seen the first two Final Destination movies, you know what you are getting into. If you haven't seen the first two, why start now?"
"The action, villainy, twists and overall logic fall short of its awesome predecessor."
"Putting [Dwayne Johnson] in this role makes about as much sense as putting Pee-Wee Herman in a weight-lifting contest. Johnson is very, very good at what he does. But for the sake of all of us Rock fans, please: Don't ask the man to act."
[The picture] is about the poorest In the series of cabaret-underworld specimens that the screen has offered.
"If you're going to lock us inside a dumb thriller with attractive people, can you at least make it lurid and lascivious?"
"As an actual procedural narrative, the film is only passably interesting, afflicted with the kind of stop-start rhythms endemic in movies that compress a legal battle spanning years into a two-hour movie."
"While Patton almost single-handedly makes you want to take the film a little more seriously than is in any way warranted, it's impossible to do so on any level..."
Full Frontal is like the 'Special Features' disc of the DVD without the original movie.
"Basically, don't put too much thought into this movie, because no one involved in making it did."
"Though the director and his sterling cast seem to get all the biographical details right, the soul is somehow missing."
"Sci-fi hits the skids as bad melodrama rules, and we get such risible dialogue as, ""It's not really me you like, it's this body"" and ""I'm still of two minds."" And how about this groaner: ""Kiss me like you want to get slapped."""
"By the end of the over-tightened ""892,"" unfortunately, a memorialization to Brown-Easley's plight, we know little about the actual man."
It's all too inane and superficial. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Other than the brilliant, deeply moving ""If Anything Happens I Love You,"" this is a surprisingly weak bunch of shorts."
It all feels like a Monty Python sketch gone horribly wrong.
"Glass disappoints, but is not unwatchable. It's not in the same league of Unbreakable and Split. James McAvoy continues to be sensational as The Horde."
"The look of this Mitty turns panoramic, but it's generic compared to the 1947 Technicolor version, in which colour and Kaye bounce out from the screen in a then-novel product."
Eddie Murphy -- was that Oscar nominated performance in Dreamgirls just something I imagined? -- continues to trash his very real talent with bottomfeeding material.
A ruthlessly winsome movie
Gets stuck in a no man's land between the real and the fictional.
"Can you imagine Clark Gable or Humphrey Bogart or Cary Grant or Spencer Tracy unzipping and pulling down their pants, feigning orgasm, self-induced or induced by another man?"
"The ensuing plot is mostly gibberish, full of universe-threatening stakes that are too easily overcome."
"There is little to recommend here, even for Huppert completists who follow her anywhere."
"Mostly ""Mank"" made me impatient -- that so much time and care and money were being spent on a sliver of Hollywood history that doesn't have much resonance beyond, well, being a sliver of Hollywood history."
"A lot has been lost in the translation, which is a shame because there is the potential there for this intrepid young woman and Jennifer Lawrence has an amazing screen presence."
the potential for in depth look into the dark world of East-West espionage is buried with a script that is more titillating than interesting.
"A sitcom type of nonsensical comedy, one that has absolutely no bite."
I'd rather not laugh than laugh at a film's practiced inability to make me laugh.
"Too much time is spent sneaking aimlessly around the building. And when the B-movie reveal finally comes into focus, it feels like a waste of a good set-up."
&#8220;I Feel Pretty&#8221; is a movie with a message &#8211; a genuinely good message&#46; And we are constantly getting whiffs of it throughout&#46; Unfortunately it&#8217;s buried in a tonally challenged film with an glaring identity crisis&#46;
"This is the most engaged De Niro performance in at least five years: his dialogue is both apocalyptically unfunny and clearly enunciated, which somehow makes it all the more galling."
"At the end of the movie we are conscious of large themes and deep thoughts, and of good intentions drifting out of focus."
"Though entertaining at times, Kung Fu Panda 3 isn't entirely different from watching that video of Tian Tian, the Smithsonian's National Zoo panda, rolling in the snow on an hourlong loop"
This is a disaster and the worst thing Judd Apatow's ever done. 
"Hardball might have been a decent movie, if it wasn't so racially insensitive, monotonous, stale, insulting and completely predictable."
...one of the most monumentally boring films I've ever forced myself to sit through.
"If any Hollywood movie were so completely devoid of black, Asian or Latino characters it would be torn to shreds by the same critics that find Crazy Rich Asians refreshing and empowering."
"The characters in Horrible Bosses are defined by their quirks, which are spelled out in boldface."
"Fairbrass moves stiffly through both the drama and fight scenes - as if he were underwater. Supporting parts in Jason Statham movies may be his calling, instead."
This is a &#8216;whatever&#8217; movie&#8230; A lot of stuff happens but without enough time to have an impact&#46;  They&#8217;re throwing too many things at you&#46;
"I would say that this film is 50/50 good and bad. The stuff that works really works, but the stuff that doesn't work doesn't really work."
"Suffice it to say, this is not a terrible film and could have held strong to its core plot if it had a few more twists and turns. Instead, White Lie comes off as an underbaked drama with a paper-thin conclusion."
"I'd stop well short of calling it a cinematic treasure, but it's better than the first one, and that's worth at least a few gold doubloons in my book."
"Dunne, who also co-wrote the script, brings admirable grit and pathos to her character without allowing her to become a victim. Still, the film's abrupt tonal shifts are jarring."
Jacobs Jr. gives us a film perched somewhere between the realistic solipsism of Mutual Attraction and the insufferable quirk of Garden State.
This isn't a horrible movie -- it's actually engaging for most of two hours -- but it's just so silly. Even in the harshest moments you feel like there's a punchline coming.
"The film, shot entirely on low-grade digital cameras and rarely framed for beauty, is stingy with rewards."
"Save for some impressive underwater photography and a scene-stealing cameo from J.K. Simmons, Renegades proves less enjoyable than a week at boot camp."
"While its plot is strictly by the numbers, Clean is elevated by its stylistic flair and propulsive pace."
"Ultimately it doesn't quite work, but along the way it is easy to be somewhat sucked in, especially by Eva Green's suicidal artist and Sam Riley's emotionally shattered dreamer"
"The movie is successful, I suppose. It's just not a movie that can't be enjoyed just as much at home."
"The very definition of a disposable, kid-quieting fluff, done in a predictably Sandler way (read: watch out for Rob Schneider's umpteenth variation on the 'You can do it!' schtick)."
"Although fast-paced with unpredictable twists and turns, the game doesn't live up to Julien's description of it as being 'better than drugs, sex, masturbation.'"
Mr. Silberling's vision never makes a seamless transfer to the screen.
"Works best if you can switch off your brain. Those who can will reach weepy nirvana. Those who can't will find this sticky-sweet wallow a bit, well, dumb."
Nap time for adults.
"Worth seeing once, but its charm quickly fades."
"Not one of the characters ever behaves in a normal human manner, nor is even one of the stories compelling, funny, or interesting."
"Edited down from its original incarnation as a two-part TV mini-series, the film in memory becomes a series of scenes with Sagan staggering about dropping drunken bons mots. Nothing can redeem this laughable material."
"It's a mess. Beautifully photographed (by Caleb Deschanel), gorgeously designed (Jeannine Oppewall) and conscientiously acted, but still a mess."
The filmmakers should've just taken the same approach I use at a sushi buffet. Less is more.
"Children up to age 4 will be diverted, while those from 5 to 10 will secretly pull out their Game Boys. Anyone over 11 will be bored to tears."
The Breed is all bite.
A little perversity never hurt anyone. But the French film Ma Mere has a lot of perversity and it hurts everyone -- including the people in the audience who don't get up and walk out.
"Unless you find the man-infant Galifianakis appealing, you%u2019ll surely spend The Hangover wistfully remembering the days when Will Ferrell made good movies and Luke Wilson was still relevant."
"Listening to children say 'f**k' is only entertaining up to a point, and this film gets its tone and timing all wrong: there are three or four good jokes, but for the most part Good Boys is a regrettable enterprise."
"Ramshackle one minute, pointlessly deliberate the next."
"Unoriginal and dull, the worst animated movie of the year so far"
"... a heartfelt and modestly poignant examination of maternal grief, yet it's consistently undermined by plot mechanics and clichs."
Deeply disappointing.
The jolting stunts and competitive races deliver all the excitement you'd want. You'll be disappointed only if you insist on a plot and complex characters.
"Maybe it's churlish to be so harsh about what is, after all, a jungle fantasy. But with such a surfeit CGI, the film is more hollow than heroic."
"Like many woeful major studio releases that run under 90 minutes, The Ex seems arbitrarily edited to squeeze in extra screenings before it's killed by word-of-mouth."
"Perhaps it will be argued that [its intention] is to excite disgust with crudeness, to invite us... to recognise a general tough goodwill which teaches the visitor to know his own weaknesses Maybe. Myself I find that the film excites disgust, period."
"A light, uneven Pygmalion story that may win young girls over with its wish fulfilment theme and teen movie staples, but does not live up to the expectations created by the cast and director."
there were better ways to portray fascinating life of Coco Chanel
"While Onward begins as a story of bereavement, it soon turns to celebrating the payoffs of positive thinking."
At best a cute anecdote that scrapes by at just over 70 minutes.
The whole enterprise is scrubbed clean of the very quirks such a comedy craves.
"For better or worse, this is a movie intended solely for fans of the series."
Shannon renders this all with an enviable ease. If only the filmmakers had been so adroit.
"Men, Women & Children attempts to achieve the tone of Reitman's early films, pirouetting between behavioral levity and dark melodrama, yet it often falls flat."
"For a film about upholding personal ideals, its glossy packaging and derivative 'will he get the girl?' narrative sell any credibility down the river in favour of affected screwball larks."
"The biggest trouble with W.C. Fields and Me has to be the ""Me"" being Monti."
Shutter is seriously short on shudders.
"It is watchable enough, but it's ended up on the wrong size of screen."
"[T]alk all they want, nothing the characters say alters the [simplistic] melodramatic mechanism."
"Yes, I pretty much followed along with the mess-with-the numbers story of this accountant, a math genius with Asperger's Syndrome"
"It's little better or worse than the original. But, to be honest, the original -- minus its nascent stars -- wasn't very good."
"This incarnation of Johnny Got His Gun is a mismatch of medium, text and talent."
"The rare period piece that resists a helpful infusion of modern-day freshness, Effie Gray is entombed by the same emotional repressiveness that frustrated its namesake."
"Director Malcolm Ingram ... opts here for the simplest, least demanding structure for this filmed hagiography: a linear, chronological order."
The script doesn't know the difference between being something scary and pointing at something scary.
It's a bad sign when even the prayers in this movie are crappy.
"It's not completely ho-ho-ho-horrible, but if this Santa Claus comes to your town, you better watch out."
that 'jolly hockey sticks' vibe feels outmoded with the only efforts to update the concept being shorter skirts and push-up bras.
"It is the sort of movie where you will know the moment it defeats itself, but will still appreciate and respect the effort in the trying."
It had NO weight to it...
"What truly makes ""U.N. Me'' repulsive is its crassness."
It seems as if we've seen this set-up before and it's getting tiresome.
"Technically well-made, but suffering on the artistic side for the lack of connection with the characters at an individual level. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"...lurching from one shootout to another,...this is pretty faithful to the facts. Unfortunately, as entertainment it falls short."
"While the movie has all the feel of a classic Hammer production (old buildings, dark shadows, moody set pieces), the story never really has enough oomph."
"The assertion that they find out who she really is, or even present a twisted, subjective version, is nothing but a beautiful lie."
"... generates some mild intrigue, although the characters remain cold and distant, allowing for little emotional investment surrounding the juicy climactic twists."
"There seems to be a lot going on in this film, but somehow it's all rather unpalatable and unsatisfactory. The one thing you can say about it is that Aaron Eckhardt is very brave."
It's like a mashup of classic commercials for Ford pickup trucks.
We can't recommend this little item as a sample of the best in Gallic films. It is clumsily put together and rather bizarrely played.
"Like e-mail, this movie is a message delivery system, no more."
Death Sentence most certainly is not a good movie.
"Though the script for ''Hellbound'' is related to the Barker story, the film drops its plot whenever a fake-looking monster walks on the screen. Ogling strange creatures is the film's true reason for being."
The roll-up-the-sleeves-and-dig-in attitude is a joy to watch; the multitude of self-righteous monologues are anything but.
... well acted but tugs too eagerly at the heartstrings and relies too heavily on manipulative melodrama that tends to trivialize its protagonist's plight.
"A sumptuous film with beautiful cinematography and a lush soundtrack, but they're wasted on a film that boasts neither great scares or shocking plot twists."
"A muddled, dire film that feels chopped to pieces."
Doesn't pull back the curtain on anything.
The latest waste of celluloid.
"It is all well and good that nobody has anything to laugh about in this movie, but the relentless gloom and frothing paranoia soon begin to drag on an earthly audience."
"Debut effort by ""Project Greenlight"" winner is sappy and amateurish."
People raised their hands in joy when Coppola announced he was returning to horror after his recent wobbly adventures in the arthouse. They'll be begging him to reconsider - or perhaps just simply to stop - after seeing this.
"Game Night is like playing Monopoly where the only properties are the four railroads. The players can go through the motions, but without more elements the overall result is good but far from as great as it could have been."
...this is such an underwhelming affair...
"The potential that Norman Wisdom once undoubtedly possessed is quite obscured by this film -- with its silly, tawdry script and the inept direction of Robert Asher."
"The crazed flag-waving would be a lot easier to take if it weren't so clearly a commercial calculation meant to salvage what is otherwise a crass, careless, shamelessly padded film."
One of the weakest kids' films in recent memory.
"A flamboyant failure, unwilling and/or unable to open itself up to anyone who wasn't totally in love with the show already."
"Using an eating disorder as a plot device for a horror movie is a slippery slope that A Banquet mishandles in uninspired ways, and it essentially sinks the movie ... A Banquet is desperately trying to be a high-minded, artsy horror film. "
It seems life is still unendurable for those who feel entitled to absolute comfort from it.
"Come back, The Angry Birds Movie, you 2016 cartoon calamity! Not only is all forgiven. You are a paragon of taste, restraint and higher learning when compared to this year's app-trocity leaping from phone screen to big screen."
Infuriating more often than frightening...takes what was intriguing in brief form and transforms it into something that feels rather derivative and flabby.
"[It's] such a miscalculated ploy that it puts future releases under the brand on immediately shaky footing. The film has too much on its plate, but that belies the incompetence with which it is handled as a story, much less as a product."
"Working with a shapeless script, directors Anthony and Joe Russo (Welcome to Collinwood) can't figure out what they're making."
"Efron works hard, and it’s an extraordinary tale, but Farrelly is in way over his head and he struggles to tell it properly. The result is a clumsy, mismanaged stew of broad, half-cooked comedy and hammy, surface-level drama."
The ending is as predictable as it is insulting in the degree to which it disappoints.
"There's serious intent here, but an often thudding execution."
Antonio Banderas' admirable performance fails to energize Hugh Hudson's handsome but ponderous period drama.
"The plot of A Long Way Down is as awkward and annoying as they come, but some really good acting by the film's four major stars almost makes this one worth seeing. Almost."
"Beneath the abundant tattoos and facial hair, the gangsters - and the women who love them - feel like nondescript bit players from an episode of ""Sons of Anarchy."""
"It just...lingers, futilely praying that the leads can wring something out of this material."
Bullock deserves better. We deserve better.
"The necessity of such a re-adaptation is directly proportional to the comparative talent involved. In this case, it's a significant step down from the first."
Where's the political sophistication that made the first movie slightly more interesting? That was a decent game of chess. The Golden Age is checkers.
"If you treat The Greatest Showman entirely as fiction, it's an earnest, enjoyable musical, but removing it from problematic source material is a challenge."
"The 1980 film was not great, but its concept was fresher, the music and dance seductive and the stories emotional, but this recycled version is too slick, bland, and overly familiar due to Disney's High School Musical series and American Idol."
"This newfangled Arthur comes up short on grandeur or even old-fashioned matinee adventure, trading them in for cosmetic Game of Thrones grot."
What the hell is Will Ferrell doing to his career?
Jim Jarmsuch has been responsible for many of the dullest hours ever spent at the movies. His new The Limits of Control is no different.
"The Last Picture Show is a stark and hypnotic portrait of a West Texas town in its final death throes, a lyrical and touching film about friendship and love and sex. Texasville is about nothing."
"Crisply made and gutsily performed as it is, this slender 78-minute film too often feels like pointed social allegory in search of a really good cover story."
"Fascinating enough to hold our interest, even as it drifts away from its early promise and tries just a bit too hard to bring all of the plot threads to a happy, tidy conclusion. But then, believability isn't an issue here."
"If disappointment can be measured in dinosaurs, ""Jurassic World Dominion"" is a brontosaurus of a bummer."
"For an adventure movie based on chase scenes in exotic locations ""Sahara"" never takes hold because director Breck Eisner and his team of screenwriters can't agree on what the story's about or what tone should resonate against it."
"A sequel that pulls time-and-a-half to carry all the corporate water the first one left at the bottom of a hill. To watch it feels like freebasing fifteen 5-Hour Energy drinks, and its message -play nice with siblings to get more LEGOs - is rancid."
"Rampage is a dull, uninspired and boring action film. [Full review in Spanish]"
"All in all, it's just another brick in the wall of cinematic stinkers."
"The problem is Gaiman's story, which keeps accumulating otherworldly mythology but doesn't establish a clear line of action in the home stretch."
"[I]f only more of ""Girls of the Sun"" had that empowering sentiment as a primary aim, the filmmaker's earnest intentions would manifest more organically."
"The big book of Coen characters must be stuffed with ideas, paper scraps jotted with traits and scrapes for the next Dude, Barton or Marge to get into. Hail, Caesar! is what happens when that book is dumped open, contents fluttering into randomness."
"The ponderous title, unfortunately, is appropriate to a film that is not only lethargic and unexciting but will be a muddle to anyone who doesn't bring a pretty good knowledge of the Watergate affair to the theatre with him."
"This movie is one of the most incompetently made things I've seen in theaters for a long while, and though moments of it may make you smile, you aren't going to care enough to be invested."
"Some of it just seems silly, which is fine for a family movie, of course, but there's silly and then there's silly. Kung Fu Panda is silly."
"Hanks is a likeable actor but rarely a subtle one. Viktor is another cutesy emotional heart-tugger in the Forrest Gump mould, all galumphing slapstick."
Strictly vacuous and insulting.
"Sorrentino's film, far from its more bombastic styling, lacks any dramatic impulse when it presents his coming of age autobiographical portrait in a Fellinian key. [Full review in Spanish]"
This is like a C-movie version of Spy Kids. And I didn't even like Spy Kids.
"The movie version of Aqua offers pretty much the same surreal, gross, half-baked antics as the TV version, and that's just not enough."
"The movie doesn't generate a lot of energy. It is dark, brooding and slow, and takes its central idea way too seriously."
You could make the same movie using the music of Huey Lewis. And most likely a less embarrassing one.
"Nothing much that's fresh to see or hear here, a near miss. But that doesn't mean the intent isn't smart."
"Three long hours of wind, an exercise in titanic self-importance intent on passing off klunky rhetoric as poignant drama."
"For all the talent Hangover II reassembles, our boys just can't muster the hair of the dog that bit them the first time around."
News flash: Love ain't easy.
"The filmmakers simply don't possess the skills to bring off a drama that can support serious themes, thus trivializing the very concerns they are trying to bring attention to."
A dumbed-down remake of Kiyoshi Kurosawa's disturbingly abstract Japanese horror film.
"Seriously overrated, it's a series of gross-out scenes intended to shock and nothing more."
"The finale, instead of tying the story together, is simply bewildering."
"Glib, ego-thumping disaster that tries so hard to be cool that flop-sweat practically drips off the sprockets."
It rather boggles the mind how so many micromanaging handlers allowed their A-list talent to participate in a production that looks funded from a frat-house's loose-couch-change collection.
The sensitive performances here deserved a better vehicle.
Thunder Force is just a full-on mess.
"Despite a few flashes of inspired brilliance, this goofy curio just isn't consistently funny, opting instead to coast on the novelty of its premise."
"Desperately avoiding the risk of even a half-second of boredom, the movie is wall-to-window-to-door noise, babbling, and jokes (the first minute sees the first fart gag), and demographically it's a hard-sell shotgun spray."
"Bits and pieces of it are clever and entertaining, true enough. But not enough to make it a certified hit."
Ambitious but lame.
"Taken 3 makes clear that the only place left for this franchise to be taken is out back, and put out of its misery."
"Punishingly paced, flimsily constructed, and tackily executed, with the subtlety and panache of a third-rate 1930s melodrama."
Blonde-haired white women are omens of doom in screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga's arduous directorial debut.
That Heigl's desperate flailing manages to make a movie this trite mildly entertaining speaks to her talent. Now maybe she can bury the hatchet with Apatow and they can make another good romantic comedy.
"It's effective, it's heart-wrenching, but it's also kind of a drag."
"So hackneyed, tired, labored and overstuffed with contempt not only for all of its targets but also its own self that one gets the feeling that the talented Mr. McDonagh has gone mad with rage."
"For Love or Money stars Michael J. Fox, one of the most likable stars in the movies, in a romantic comedy so lightweight that his charm has to carry the whole enterprise."
The shenanigans of five grown men letting their adolescence hang out
Who is supposed to be excited by this? What child would care? What adult would care?
"It could use more heart, courage and brains."
"Remember when McKay was making movies like Step Brothers? Now he's making movies like Vice and Don't Look Up, glib, unfunny infomercials that are closer to Ted Talks than Talladega Nights."
Devil's Kettle might as well have been called Crock Pot.
"There are interesting scenes, moments, ideas: but Eastern Promises does not have the sinew and boldness of Cronenberg's best work."
"At points, 2012 was tedious enough to make us feel like we were in the theater until 2012"
A dull premise with lackluster execution&#46; The Lion King still reigns supreme&#46;
"The situation -- a mother and daughter switch personalities for a day -- is rife with possibilities, but since this 1977 comedy is a Disney film, said possibilities are scrupulously squandered."
"Like the original experiment, this film fails when it tries to impose a conclusion, rather than letting its meaning reveal itself naturally."
What was once fresh and fun is now just obnoxious and worn out.
"Watching Felipe languish before the camera, it is hard not to question what he got out of the experience, and why the filmmakers couldn't have aided by him. The observational style of the doc makes one feel helpless. But is that productive?"
"In what has been an alarmingly weak summer, Transformers 2 really doesn't contribute much to improve it."
"The film's understanding of the brittleness that begets the ""traditions"" of frat culture is altogether shallow."
"there is plenty of conflict to be found in the Bukowski's life and work, yet little of it makes its way into Born into This"
"Deepa Mehta's film is only intermittently engaging: it is limited in scope and imagination, and in parts it becomes plodding and stagey."
"Beauty and the Beast lacks both the charm and the aesthetic splendor of its predecessor; it's a meaningless and empty remake that, for the most part, just poorly mimics the original's iconic scenes."
It easily takes home the Josef Mengele award as the vilest movie in recent memory.
A by-the-numbers effort that won't do much to enhance the franchise.
Olivier Assayas is treading water with this amiable but self-indulgent and finally negligible movie about intrigue and adulterous goings-on in the publishing world of Paris.
To say this movie is sick is too facile. Let's just say it's perverse. Crash is a grotesque film filled with vacuous characters and a destitute theme.
A movie for which a customer might have demanded a refund in the DTV days.
"A silly, overexaggerated movie."
"Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is superb and at times almost redolent, capturing the smells of both lush fields and grimy trenches, but the film's stabs at episodic drama are torpid and unambitious."
Everyone loves Rota Moreno but somehow this documentary makes you love her not so much.
Nothing in this assemblage of clips will convince anyone not already sold on the enduring artistic importance of these movements beyond the world bounded by 14th Street and the Holland Tunnel.
To Paraphrase Denis Leary: I'm stoned; I'm nobody. I'm stoned; I'm famous. I'm stoned; I'm dead.
"Will Ferrell and Nicole Kidman try to turn an old TV show into a magical Hollywood satire, but their trick's not much of a treat."
"I had hoped more of the stories could have been explored, but they were not."
"While it features a few powerful moments and impressive cinematography, the film manages to say nothing new about its themes and does so in a particularly out-of-touch manner."
"The doc prioritizes flash over facts, leaving you pining for the New Yorker exposé it could've been."
Categorically the worst movie of Tom Cruise's career.
"It's a film about healing; about burnt-out yang being weeded, fertilized, and watered by yin, to grow a relationship tree. But, like, a Charlie Brown Christmas tree."
"Parts paranormal, home invasion, family drama. Whatever Aftermath is trying to be, it's bland. In every way. With a couple leaving a stained past behind to enter an even more troubled future, there's character stupidity at every turn."
"Romantic comedy is not supposed to inspire apathy, but Alex and Emma does just that."
"Has little connection with first two ""Halloweens,"" including true terror."
"Basically, Sonic the Hedgehog is a distilled encapsulation of all the useless, banal grotesqueries inherent to our collective capitalist nightmare in a fuzzy blue ball. Eat it up, kiddos!"
"A film that could've been told in a shortfilm, faster and more efficient. [Full review in Spanish]"
A terrible movie about the workers who keep the electrical grid functioning.
Are you aching for a great big Christmas downer? Look no further.
It's puzzling why a talent like Macy bothered with a project that is so long on sentiment and short on comic relief - and unclear on what it wants to say on a variety of hot-button topics.
"Robert De Niro gives one of his warmest performances in recent years in this mighty likeable, ultimately flimsy comedy-drama. Much like its star, the film coasts along on charm and audience goodwill. A little more edge might have helped."
"As a whole, Kill Bill might be an entertaining product, but, after seeing Volume 1, I was insulted."
"Unfortunately, Aladag was not as nuanced in her approach as her star."
"The Incredibles announces the studio's arrival in the vast yet overcrowded Hollywood lot of eardrum-bashing, metal-crunching action sludge."
"Bigelow isn't trying to entertain the audience, but I'm not sure what she wants us to take from the film as the end credits start."
full review at Movies for the Masses
"I wouldn't have minded seeing a little Bay-hem on the big screen in Transformers 3; instead, with battles I didn't care about between characters I barely knew, all I got was idiocy, tedium and expense in the pursuit of Bay-nality."
"Universe's generic storyline and literalist approach to the songs pull it down. Even a relatively simple love song like George Harrison's ""Something"" outclasses the relationship it illustrates here."
Painfully obvious and cliched.
"This is little more than a Lawnmower Man redux, mowing its way through maudlin metaphysics and moral manure."
Strained and uncomfortably buffonish. Everybody (except Clooney) is mugging when they should've just tried acting. Real satire draws blood. This one nudges you in the ribs.
"History, as subject matter, is hard enough to sell as cinema. The Better Angels will not make the struggle any easier."
"The Shining meets Grand Budapest Hotel, but not in a good way. Good looking pastiche."
Overwrought and inept.
"The set-up couldn't be better primed for tension, but director Brad Furman doesn't supply as much clammy suspense as you might hope."
Dylan Kidd seems to be at the expense of another writer's published weepie rather than the sharp repartee he brought to Roger Dodger
"its dramatization of a U.S. dream team's journey to the international showcase is leaden with predictable character types and storytelling clichs, neither of which its well-executed but oddly infrequent dance sequences are able to overcome."
"It goes on and on, and just when you think you can't take any more insufferably trite good intentions, it keeps on going."
"If your child is in Grade 9, I can pretty much guarantee they're too jaded and cynical for a movie in which blemish-free twentysomething actors enthuse about how prom night will be the most IMPORTANT NIGHT OF MY LIFE, OMG!"
A train wreck romcom.
"Wan is still terrifically skilled at executing horrifying moments, but he's lost control of the bigger picture."
"Howitt's story stalls at that point, and from there on things quickly devolve into soap opera-like melodrama, with some disappointing character revelations and a preposterous ending."
"When Luzhin's old chess teacher shows up, the movie becomes a slow-motion wreck."
It doesn't offer viewers anything more than the sight of a talented director treading water with a story he seems to have little interest in telling.
"The ease with which the group falls back into their old patterns of trust and familiarity after an awkwardly long period of separation is narratively convenient, but not really probable."
"At any point, do the people involved realize they've got a lot of pretty animated images, no jokes, less story, and voice performances that never click together?"
"Marceau's real-life heroics cannot be denied but, as presented by writer-director Jonathan Jakubowicz, none of it really comes together into a satisfying whole."
"When Carrie asks Big, ""Am I just a bitch wife who nags you?"" I could hear all the straight men in the theater -- all four of us -- being physically prevented from responding."
"It's a tangential film, or perhaps elliptical. It approaches its ideas from the side without ever actually coming straight at them."
"A semidrama always on the verge of reaching for laughs, but never grasping them."
Turns profane raw materials into a lackluster array of stock horror drivel.
As involving as a pre-takeoff explanation of jetliner safety features.
"[T]his is an intriguing portrait of near-suicidal misery... until, ironically, it tries to lend Jim some hope.... [N]o one seems to know where to take things from there."
"American audiences expect crouching tigers and hidden dragons in their Asian fare, so plodding elephants may be a little anti-climactic. This one is for the history buffs."
"Chris Morgan (the screenwriter on ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" - 2006) is to blame for a script that runs more like a '70s Ford Pinto than the hopped up muscle cars burning rubber onscreen."
"Should convince studios that banking on computer-weaned kids to actually leave their keyboards to venture out of the house and pay for a movie was, is and will remain a bad idea."
[Rose] has little presence as an actress ... and her unremarkable voice seems better suited for singing corporate jingles than the Great American Songbook.
An entire generation has come of age since 1981 and I suspect that only those who haven't seen its predecessor will find any laughs in this rote remake.
A messy film can be just as boring as one where nothing happens and that is the case here.
"'Butterfingered' is the word for the big-fisted direction of Jez Butterworth, who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach."
It's an Assault on the senses.
"Much overrated horror, not even minor classic in this corner"
"The ensemble cast is mostly agreeable, but the script eventually bogs down amid too many characters and too many contrivances."
"By the time it gives us enough clues to figure out what's real and what's simulated, you might not care enough to put them together."
"Joe Carnahan shows how the film's titular bad-ass heroes become rogue fighters, but takes an age to do so. The TV show's opening credits managed the same feat in around 20 seconds."
This film is strictly 'plebe' material and should be booted out of theaters on its white-uniformed rear.
Kuldip Patwal: I Didn't Do It! fails to make a journey since it is too busy not giving a damn about Dalits while simultaneously trying desperately to be an edgy thriller.
We -- and the genre itself -- could use a good spoof or satire of superhero movies. Thunder Force definitely isn't it.
"Forrest Gump is a perfectly competent movie. Its major failure is one of morals and ideas, and the fact that so many, many people did not seem to notice or care, is what really flummoxed me."
"""The Protégé"" has so many cool elements, so many reasons that it should be better than it is. Chief among them are Maggie Q, Keaton and Jackson. But they can only do so much, and ultimately the film feels flat."
Can a Woody Allen movie set in 1920s France with Colin Firth and Emma Stone really be bland and forgettable? Yes!
A humorless self-indulgent and self-loathing mess that is saddled with an uninteresting story and arty pretensions.
"Audiard's fancy camera and music mannerisms are as trashy and superfluous as a Michael Mann movie: using ""Mack the Knife"" as a theme doesn't match Brecht but reveals Audiard's essential lack of interest in Malik's culture."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger provides a jolt of energy to the final half-hour of this otherwise lackluster satire about bickering hitmen, as he sends up his image and action tropes in general with freewheeling bravado."
"Bottom line, it's extremely predictable, even if you didn't read the original novella."
"A hyphen isn't the only thing missing from Eight Legged Freaks. Wit and imagination have joined that AWOL punctuation mark, perhaps in the same place where socks go when they vanish from your dryer."
"The King's Man has its moments, but it also has a lot of flaws. Fiennes and Ifans steal the show, but the disconnected story makes it feel like two completely different movies."
[Director] Litvak crams so many earth-shattering revelations and long-buried resentments into 93 minutes that the film feels as if it's struggling to provide something recognizable to every potential ticket buyer.
"The weight of Recall's mystery is suffocated in a series of fist fights, hovercar pile-ups, and foot chases pulled straight out of the latest platformer video game."
Advance word that this would be the scariest horror since Amityville proves well wide of the mark.
The Braff brothers tried to say something in Wish I Was Here about the commitment and faith that hold families &#8232;together. But their hesitancy allows the message to dissolve into the overall banality of the movie.
"Everyone is equally blunted by blandness. All the kids who undergo military training are constantly reminded they need to act like a family, but the script never affords them the opportunity."
A homage less interesting than the subterranean films it references and excerpts.
"I found the idea of teens laying down their coins to play arcade games in this present day a strange, semi-intentional archaism - nostalgic wish-fulfilment on the part of the middle-aged people creating the movie."
A true story that shies away from the truth.
One of Hollywood's moldy oldies -- brothers on opposite sides of the law -- gets yet another spin in this lead-footed crime drama by James Gray.
"Though there are a few great moments from the supporting players, they can't compensate for the emotional doughnut at the center of the story: a selfish, inarticulate lump where a leading man should be."
"Green and Straughan can't seem to agree on a tone or ways in which to make the subsequent political battle that interesting, engaging or entertaining. (Full Content Review - Sex, Violence, Profanity, etc. - for Parents also available)"
"Delivery Man has sentiment and affability embedded in its DNA, but Scott and Vaughn don't do enough to nurture the film to its full potential."
Collateral Beauty's positive attributes are slowly-but-surely crushed beneath the weight of a progressively eye-rolling and impossible-to-swallow storyline...
"At the centre of it Ma is a studied, unrevealed figure, while the rehearsals and jam sessions create a joyous glow of affirmation that overwhelms a deeper sense of inquiry; the longer the film goes on, the less it has to say."
"There's something particularly dispiriting about a movie that seems predicated on edgy authenticity, then goes soaring over the melodramatic top without any self-awareness."
"Like star Kristen Stewart's performance, it's pretty on the outside but hollow on in the inside."
It takes more than some stars and plot points to make a successful film.
"Labors to channel old fashioned Hollywood sophistication as unsuccessfully as any average 21st century rom-com, it just has subtitles and gorgeous Monaco locations to distract you along the way."
"Uunevenly paced, mounts slowly to a sizzling prizefight sequence, which comes somewhere about the middle, then sags off to a long-drawn, agonized finish."
"What do dithering tv weathermen do when they retire? They must take their lame, witless banter and their awkward timing to Hollywood to write and direct movies. That might explain Get Smart, one of the latest in a long line of humid, mediocre, tire"
A bland time full of unexplored potential.
"A rather pallid, pedestrian telling of a tale that screams out for more imaginative treatment."
"At some point, the social mores that functionally banned most other forms of ethnic stereotyping will catch up with the Slavs, a sad day indeed for middling screenwriters."
[I]t just ends up feeling like an intergalactic soap opera.
"Yes Day is a film which features kids tipping sugar directly into their mouths, and that's probably the best analogy; a short burst of energy which might make you feel happy for a little while, but which ultimately isn't all that good for you."
Writer-directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer seem to think a half-baked imitation of the original constitutes instant comic gold.
Just as readers will likely get lost in its gobbledygook subtitle&#44; so too does Rudd get swallowed up by the consuming CGI insanity of his latest comic book extravaganza&#46;
"It's a one-gag film that rises or falls on how funny you find the sight of fat, grease-slicked Jack Black crammed into spandex pants and capering like an epileptic lamb."
"Un relato crudo, probablemente desconcertante y extrañamente tragicómico, sólo para seguidores incondicionales del director, que repite su estilo sin sorpresas."
"Always Be My Maybe hits all of the beats we have come to expect yet fails to do so well enough, as if the mere existence of a technically well-structured romantic comedy is better than nothing."
"Just as robot scientists describe the ""uncanny valley"" effect, the more Clooney tries to be Clark Gable, the wider the gulf appears between them."
"Despite some lovely architecture and solid performances, this tedious and uninvolving period romance can't fulfill its epic aspirations."
Ambitious but anti-climatic Black Mass is an interesting miss...
This low-budget indie is somber and dreary on a moment-to-moment basis and leaves its talented cast stranded with few opportunities to alleviate the sense of stasis.
"""The Finest Hours"", based on an actual event, should have been edge-of-the-seat suspenseful, but it is not."
"It feels like the result of an unenthusiastic director working with a lacklustre script, under the eye of a studio more concerned with marketing the film than making it."
"Ramis has got his comic premise, but instead of constructing a plot, he and his co-writers work up only some feeble vignettes."
"A shoddy, silly, testosterone-fueled action film throwback, which teeters between clever self parody and an embarrassingly bad attempt to create an actual action blockbuster."
"Holmes' unfocused screenplay makes clear that his subject was an honorable thief (Hall never took a life), but the writer-director never makes any of it matter."
Occasionally [spikes] into dopey fun but mostly [drags] the lake of Frankenstein adaptations past for story beats that are beyond well worn.
"[Antonio] Banderas has a tentative charm - he is always holding something in reserve - and is captivating in an encounter with an old flame, Federico, but he's fighting a losing battle against the lugubriousness of the material."
One of the worst Christmas movies ever made.
"I'm knocked out and close to a nervous breakdown having to witness such a neurotic person... For three-quarters of the film, I watch a woman cry and scream. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Wilson, the man, may serve up great work from Harrelson, but Wilson, the movie, soon proves that 94 minutes in the character's company are far too many."
"The only time the movie connects is when Kendrick & Co. start singing, performing dynamic and energetically staged numbers."
Little more than a soap opera. And it's not a very good one at that.
"After sitting through this fractious fairy tale, we feel as plucked as a Christmas goose."
"What his expedition finds is less interesting to me than how he finds it. The tiny submarines, the 6 foot model, the video robots - these are all innovative, curious."
"A mumblecore bore about two heterosexual men, one living a conventional married life and the other a bohemian bachelor, who decide to make a gay porn movie on a dare. It would have been far more interesting, I'm afraid."
"A slasher shouldn't feel as boring and dragged out as this film is. From a barely functioning plot to characters we don't really root for, There's Someone Inside Your House squanders whatever potential there was from its earlier set pieces."
Both unfunny and rather gruesome
"Steve Kloves has written five of the Harry Potter screenplays, and The Half-Blood Prince reeks of formula."
"Even by director Michael Bays over-the-top standards, the frenetic pace turns tiresome. For two hours and 16 minutes, screenwriter Chris Fedak throws everything but the kitchen sink into the never-ending storyline. "
"The main problem for the film is gunning for lovability over authenticity, and to be absolutely fair, achieving neither."
"Stanton's screenwriting skills are, on this evidence, slightly below those of George Lucas, so there's plenty of clunky exposition and such inadvertent laugh-lines as: 'I would lay down my life for Helium.'"
"Excruciating as it can be for parents to endure, it may be worthwhile for kids to see the movie."
Horror doesn't get much more paint-by-numbers.
"A movie that manages to be everything -- romantic comedy, adventure film, family melodrama, farce, gangster movie, and history lesson -- and absolutely nothing all at once."
We're kept at a distance from Eric ... because 6 Below: Miracle on the Mountain isn't willing to give him complete credit for his survival.
"Pepper has always been what grounded Tony, what connected him to reality. Iron Man 3 ultimately disconnects Pepper from reality...Whether or not Tony deserves better, Pepper certainly does."
"An hour and a half of emotional overload that you can either buy into and feel depressed, or reject and feel cheated."
"Vivas tries to add a family-drama twist to an otherwise standard survival story, but the characters aren't complex enough (and the secrets aren't explosive enough) to elevate this beyond a basic zombie flick."
"It's by-the-numbers, big-screen video gaming. Hooh-ra!"
"The film is nearly over before you begin to wonder why it's called ""The November Man,"" and giving any thought to the explanation is beside the point."
"So, so bad, it's hardly worth mentioning."
"Ayer's overlong, 134-minute screenplay never pops with any urgency, passion, or fire."
It's all more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho.
"Violent, feverishly fragmented adaptation of the TV show, relying on sinister style over substance."
"While it effectively taps into some common fears of the unknown, this lighthearted, low-budget thriller doesn't have enough twists to maintain its suspense at feature length."
"It all comes off a bit like an extended episode of ""Everybody Hates Chris"" with really bad language."
This is another of Jim Carrey&apos;s surefire vehicles that can be whittled down to a phrase&#58; Jim Carrey is the Grinch&#59; Jim Carrey is God&#46;
continues the story with increasingly diminishing results
There is potential in every one of these action sequences&#44; only for them to fall flat typically due to some combination of choppy editing&#44; weightless stakes&#44; a confused tone&#44; and monotony
"The challenge of crafting a political satire based on a political system that's already a clown circus may have been too much for the filmmakers. Yet when this slash-and-burn comedy scores, it's convulsively funny."
Chimpanzees share 96 per cent of our DNA and a common Pan Prior ancestry. We'll bet they're embarrassed to admit as much when they see this.
What's missing is a healthy dose of skepticism -- of the material and of traditional horror techniques.
As moth-eaten as a Bengal tiger rug on the floor of a London men's club.
Unloads both barrels of righteous indignation on behalf of the working man.
"Belabored and in need of some tangential edits, Bodied may be more than the sum of its parts but could have potentially been more gutsy."
The thing comes off more like an action-movie parody on The Simpsons than an actual action movie.
You could attempt to summarize the plot of 'Stay' -- or could try to catch the morning fog in a butterfly net: Either activity would produce the same results.
"The Twilight films can hardly be considered masterpieces, but neither do they deserve the fear and loathing from male moviegoers threatened by the very existence of any franchise aimed at women. Still, this one fares the worst in practically every regard."
[A] painfully flat gross-out comedy ...
"So long as he's on the horse the movie works, but whenever he dismounts so does the story."
The script treats its characters with respect. The relentless music is another matter entirely.
"Tom Flynn's script isn't afraid of asking tough questions when it comes to Mary's fate... but couches the rest of the film in such superfluous material that it's nearly impossible to cut through the noise. In short, the math doesn't add up."
The writer-producer-director of American Dreamz makes nearly every mistake in the satirical book. His targets are either too easy or too dated. He's inconsistent in his attitudes toward them. His stereotypes are stale.
"Yet, something strange happens somewhere along the second act. The movie's charms kick in much like symptoms for COVID-19 five days after exposure."
"Stone used to know in his gut that a sermon belongs in the pulpit, not the multiplex. No more."
A horrifically bloated 127 minutes&#46;
Hopelessly naive ... The final impression is that a few bad apples were all that prevented the Christians and Muslims from joining hands and participating in sing-alongs.
The hurtful truth is that others -- many others -- have co-opted Romero's whole living dead thing and have been doing it with more style than the Pittsburgh zombie auteur is capable of these days.
"The momentum from the opening dissipates early and without a real engine pushing the movie foward, it begins to drag...the film is 87 minutes and feels like it's 2 hours."
"This November marks the 50th anniversary of his assassination in Dealey Plaza, and as such, it was inevitable that there'd be some kind of film to mark the occasion. We just wish it wasn't as terrible as ""Parkland,"""
"The 3-D performance footage is impressively lavish, though the film's unending idolization of the amiable singer will quickly exhaust all but the most devoted fans."
"Did I mention there are fight sequences? They are by far the best part of this movie, but even they disappoint."
"28 Days is a cutesy, heavy-handed morality tale that contains nary a believable moment."
"Writer/director Ron Krauss gives this 'based on a true story' an Afterschool Special feel with vaguely unsettling Holy Roller overtones, a secret agenda delivered like cod liver oil."
One of the most patently imbecilic thrillers to come down the pike in many a moon.
Margiela's notoriously reclusive nature prevents much meaningful insight behind the scenes.
The only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare.
"Director Paul McGuigan and screenwriter David Boula are content to rely on the usual suspects, taking their visual and dramatic cues from other, more clever and involving sci-fi capers."
You know things aren't going well when it gets tedious watching a teen girl strut around in short shorts and a loose top and you're waiting for her to use the ax and get it over with
"Joel Kinnaman deftly leads a cast of heavy hitters that includes Rosamund Pike, Clive Owen and Ana de Armas, even in what quickly becomes an overly aggressive game of cat and mouse that conjures the spectre of similar, better films like The Departed."
"There are some big laughs to be had, but just as many fumbles. Deuce would have been better off staying stateside and talking to his late wife's artificial leg."
"Betting dollars to donuts, the most humdrum trip to the market will offer a more riveting entertainment. Parker Posey notwithstanding ... Price Check is as limp as last week's lettuce."
A play for the fickle attentions of middlebrow moviegoers looking for an easy cause they can champion.
"Guy Ritchie's latest attempt at going back to his ""criminal"" cinema feels out of place and out of shape, translating into a story with little novelty or none at all, in spite of its top performers best efforts."
"While DreamWorks Animation's latest movie starts well and ends sweetly, the loud, frenetic middle seems like an awfully good time to squeeze in a nap."
"Without realizing it, the film becomes an ode to middle-aged male lechery of a literate sort; it plays like Left Coast Woody Allen, and I don't mean that as a compliment."
Old annoying ethnic family stereotypes meet new annoying gay-relationship stereotypes in this candidate for Kiss Me Guido's heretofore uncontested niche.
"The result is a heartless, mirthless waste of impeccably crafted special-effects work, made even more unbearable by James Corden's irritating vocal turn in the title role. Parents and children deserve so much better."
"Portman's emotional connection to the material couldn't be more obvious, yet the film itself is still largely inert."
"Just watch the original, The Intouchables."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger's latest vehicle, End of Days, is such a witless, bombastic, by-the-numbers hunk of millennial hooey it made me nostalgic for Commando."
Prisoners is cruel and unusual punishment.
"""Me Before You"" is a feast for the eyes, whether our doomed lovers are vacationing in Mauritius or trading banalities in Will's castle quarters. But it's the ugliness of the film's message that a life without limbs is not worth living that galls you."
"There is a theory that every Hollywood star has a turkey or two in their closet, so today, step forward Anthony Edwards, star of the hit TV series ER."
"The picture itself is gorgeously realized and richly atmospheric, but the subjects within the frame remain still lives."
Wicker Park frustrates to no end when a smidgen of common sense on anyone's behalf would clear up everything.
"The movie is a long and absurd exercise in kitsch, without any high aims and even fewer incentives to inspire more than a passive glance."
"By trading sexiness for melodrama and then subjecting us to a kidnapping subplot that is exceedingly ridiculous even by Lifetime Network standards, this movie is almost unwatchable."
"The stunning backdrop winds up being a crutch for And While We Were Here, which leaves its adept performers unchallenged in the face of forbidden passion."
"My Blueberry Nights should have played like a memory, but its hard-living, luckless losers are too beautiful to be believed."
The problem is not that they repeat formulas for this sequel or that all of it is a bad copy of its predecessor...the bad thing is that feeling of an adulterated product. [Full review in Spanish]
"A gentle, inoffensive chamber piece."
"Whether ""The Rental"" will injure the Airbnb industry is debatable, but its impact on moviegoers will otherwise barely be noticed."
"Full of fits and starts, it never really gets going, stalling at every turn without even giving us enough of what we paid to see -- Snoop Dogg and gore."
"Cops prowl darkened mazes, looking for perps they probably couldn't see even if they found them."
"The visuals are worth the price of admission, but this is as generic and by-the-numbers an origin story as the MCU has ever made. It's better than 'Green Lantern,' but it will remind you of 'Green Lantern'."
Aliens vs&#46; Predator&#58; Requiem is a bad movie&#46;
It occurs to me in all honesty that if you rent this thing you deserve what you get.
"What the original actors executed with ease, this lot make look clumsy, and joyless."
"Can't decide whether it wants to be a black comedy, dumb farce, or sentimental sit-com."
Too often the tone is incongruous&#59; sequences of excessive carnage already possess the right amount of uncomfortable humor&#44; without inconsequential characters chiming in for additional&#44; flimsy gags&#46;
It's a film to possibly employ to distract your kids for a few minutes if they've already seen absolutely every other option.
"The supposedly new, improved, futuristic Jason is just the same guy with a hipper hockey mask. Thumbs down."
"This kind of yarn would have inspired a major audience draw a couple decades ago, but now the whole thing feels tired and derivative."
"...the director spends so much time recounting in minute and realistic detail the agony of Christ that he neglects the stronger, spiritual message, of love and kindness."
Shoahxploitation.
"It's being billed as an adult drama, but beware: Darling Companion is a ponderous film with very little charm and a snail's pace."
"The characters, the story, and the subject matter of the film demand to be discussed and lauded, but the movie itself is not only conventional but openly uninterested in doing much more than getting you to the crying finale, like in a dry legal brief"
"A country music drama with a big heart but not enough focus, Country Strong tackles fame, artistic expression, addiction and love, although none of them deeply enough."
"Triple Frontier could have been a good film instead of the brutal, rigged mess it turned out to be."
The movie offers nothing new; I think I'll stick with the original TV series. [Full review in Spanish]
"It is normally quite exciting if you don't know where a film is going. In Tommaso however, that uncertainty is frustrating."
"An attempt to do for post-#metoo feminism what Jordan Peele did for race relations in Get Out, but mired in cliché."
"It's only half of a good movie. As soon as those dogfighting planes land, the story trips up by skimming the surface of history."
[How is it?] Loud and shrill. Bring earplugs. Seriously.
"What Lynch strenuously avoids is any examination of who these two individuals are, how the passage of time affects them and what could possibly draw them back together given that neither one of them is a walk in the park."
"With Dark Shadows, an erratic mish-mash of horror, comedy and camp period satire, Burton delivers less than even his most ardent followers might have bargained for."
"Eventually, you realize the movie isn't comprised of much more than premise, greeting-card wisdom and coincidences, and its two hours start to grow long."
"McGregor's character paradoxically gets too much and not enough. Swede feels clogged with sentiment for his daughter, with little room for other emotions."
"While Mendeluk's film is well intentioned and mildly intriguing, it falls well short of grandness."
"An entertaining film, but unfortunately is the weakest of the trilogy. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The two leads have considerable screen appeal and decent chemistry, but are ill served by the material's sitcomish beats and mawkish resolution."
"The movie has its affecting moments, but the drearily inevitable has come true -- an original and rather haunting poetic conception has been turned into a literal-minded love story."
The film's most inventive running gag involves what must be a MacFarlane obsession with the classic stiff subjects of Old West photographs.
"What Ewan McGregor's ""American Pastoral"" does to the Philip Roth novel it adapts is the cinematic equivalent of unslinking a Slinky."
"The characters here are swamped not only in huge surf, but in the unmitigated corn of a hopelessly mawkish screenplay."
filled with over the top gore and unnecessary plot twists better off left unseen. Leave this one at the orphanage.
"Director Moore and writer Neil Simon seem to have no real affection for either the characters they plunder mercilessly for laughs, or the locked room puzzle they turn on its head. Introductions over, the film slides downhill."
"action junkies, like myself, will feel like they've been duped"
"Nothing but a technical exercise in complete pointlessness. I've seen far worse films, but I haven't seen a film that deserved to fail quite as badly as this in years."
Semen joke. Fat joke. Goofy voice. Blah.
...feels like an entire television season's worth of story crammed into an awkward and ungainly two-hour picture.
"Passengers is such a mixed bag. Lots of people are not going to be able to get past the controversial premise; others, like myself, may be impressed that its grand stage holds such lofty goals, only to be let down as things veer off into the expected."
"American Sausage Standoff is a satire of religion, bigotry, and corruption of small-town America with a memorable visual style and strong performances, but the humor never takes center stage."
This is the way modern-day blockbuster franchises are designed: You watch the new film so that you know what's going on in preparation for the next one
"They're all pawns of the oil industry -- or rather, they're pawns of director Stephen Gaghan."
...mean-spirited and sophomoric sexual slapstick with all the trivial charm of a sloppy hickey on the neck...an extended dirty joke looking for perverse praise and attention
Pattinson's callowness and tendency to play rage as petulance don't help.
"Gross and skeevy, not to mention painfully long and repetitious."
"... started off incredibly strong and petered out to a predictable and dull ending. Not great, not awful, it's certainly a disappointment."
"What starts off as an intriguing coming-of-age story, ends up being a convoluted movie with too many characters having problems."
"It's strictly for devotees who won't balk at plot absurdities, clunky dialogue and patchy characterizations. I suspect loyalists will be pleased, but I can't imagine anyone else wanting to jump into the tale here."
"Frankly, this is one of those failures that is doubly disappointing when you consider the calibre of the failees."
These scenes flow like treacle and then the movie really slows down.
A visual feast that nonetheless leaves one feeling hungry for some emotional nourishment after the succession of all-too-similar courses has passed.
"Unrelentingly grim throughout its 130-minute runtime, Papillon is an exhausting experience."
"As superbly rendered as his 3D world is, Cameron has populated it with characters who are strictly 2D. And sometimes not even that."
"A fantasy adventure film needs more than ""cool creatures,"" a rousing score, and two certifiably over-the-top performances to make a lasting impression."
"Besson's black-and-white angel fantasy is a weak homage to Wings of Desire, if that's what he was shooting for."
"Despite a deeply expressive performance from Javier Bardem as an an author suffering from early-onset dementia, Sally Potter's deeply personal film stubbornly refuses to come to life."
"In this trashy Tarantino rip-off, I smell audience burn-out."
"In a medium increasingly dominated by special effects, the wow factor [of stage magic] is hard to maintain."
"The new film isn't very good, but it's possible to sit through it without holding your nose."
"If the only way to make us care about the main characters is to jeopardize their more compelling loved ones, why not make a movie about the loved ones instead?"
What happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares?
Perhaps the most insufferable Tarantino knockoff since the 90s.
the parents are really just a little too weird and the whole film is hard to warm up to.
Garish and superficial.
"Had Albert Zugsmith, who produced The Incredible Shrinking Man... concentrated upon the comic aspects of his story, he might have succeeded in creating a superb farce."
"Slapdash, with dialogue and plot points that were cliches in Dickens' era, the pic sends up, then reaffirms, all the values the media sell us each holiday: compassion, forgiveness, tolerance."
"While believable and well put-together, the story is a bit too slight to fully command our attention."
"Rango was crafty enough to extend an olive branch to adult viewers. Rio is strictly for the kids, and anyone expecting this Brazilian-set film to contain any references to City of God (or, heck, even The Boys from Brazil) will be sorely disappointed."
"At least a soap opera has the luxury of spreading its quota of sensationalism over many years. Concertinaed into a time span of mere days and distributed among only three households, the litany of suffering in Broken can appear hysterical."
"By the hour mark, it becomes abundantly clear why this film was made: Jackie Chan wanted it to happen. Everyone else is fairly disposable."
[I]t offers little to no insight into any specific element of what made the man unique.
The film is one that might have been dreamed up by one of the cynical bros from the Hangover during a blacked-out stupor.
"[Hellboy] is gloomily gorgeous, but its tone careens recklessly between light comedy and dark portentousness and the character relationships suffer."
The rather pale and uninspiring story of obscure poet Elizabeth Bishop's love affair in Brazil in the 1950s and '60s.
The script is full of half-considered character stances.
"The message of the picture, delivered with the sincerity of an unsolicited email from Nigeria, is that everyone deserves a second chance and forgiveness - even, presumably, Ashton Kutcher."
"Has many promising ingredients, yet somehow none of them quite gel."
"If the ultra-annoying Hitch happened to be a French film (Le Hitch?), it might be welcomed with the same double standard as this slapsticky rom-com..."
About as scary as a shower that suddenly changes temperature when someone flushes the toilet.
"Fans of musical theater will work themselves into a lather over Joel Schumacher's by-the-book film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's monotonous play, but most audiences will either fall asleep or hit the cinema doors running."
"""Dark Shadows"" is amusing, in fits and spurts, and sure to make tons of money, but terribly familiar and fatigued."
"Everything that goes wrong on Wren and Glaisher's flight is a manufactured obstacle, a video game puzzle we know is going to be solved."
"Centurion feels more like a video game than a movie. And it works fairly well on that sensory-overload level, except it's a video game you can't play."
"Space Chimps tries to please both kids and parents with a queasy mix of rapid-fire, Looney Tunes-y slapstick and sly pop culture references, but the surprisingly flat animation and tired jokes keep it from ever leaving orbit."
The running badinage of Roberts and Nolte lacks the tartness and bite that made those classic couplings and the old screwballs crackle with contentious wit.
"Whitaker sweats, vomits, blows and wails as the Bird (so named for hanging around jazz clubs like a yardbird), laying in some minor-key grace to Parker's self-destruction along the way. But he never lets you into his darkest fears."
For those who read the book and enjoyed it the celluloid version will disappoint. 
"Usher, who has a squinty charm, is forced to display an infinite polite chivalry that would have shamed Sidney Poitier."
It's amazing that a country which professes to love hockey makes such lame movies about the sport.
Feels like it stepped in dog doo-doo but doesn't know it.
It's too bad the narrative machinations bog down what otherwise is a fine tale of political manoeuvring.
"Instead of building tension and suspense, It just jumps from scene to scares with no connection or coherence to thread them together other than the mere fact that they've been placed on top of one-another, like toys mixed up from different sets."
...the scattered vibe prevents the viewer from working up any interest in or enthusiasm for the central character's ongoing exploits.
"It fell short, and it's nothing you need to see on a big screen. Or on a small one either."
"Unfortunately, the filmmakers forget that the most important part of an in-joke is the joke."
"Prospect deserves credit for its ambitious vision and scope, but Earl and Caldwell's effort is undone by mediocre script and character work."
Army of One avoids lazy Red State bashing ... along with insightful humor.
"Dragged Across Concrete is exciting, provocative, and more than a little phony."
The film has no shape or narrative force. It merely chronicles events.
What would be nice is if we feel something&#47;anything for any given character&#46;
"Mostly though, [McHenry] just goes through the motions of moviemaking, pandering the audience with hot sex and brutal violence while playing with recurring bus imagery that goes nowhere."
"I saw Revenge of the Fallen at Imax, which is probably why I managed to stay awake in what for me was the world's most boring movie."
"The whole thing is coarse and vulgar, as it hides its low fascinations behind a scrim of Holocaust piety until it becomes pure kitsch."
"The fact that this film is constructed to endorse the exercise of murderers, to emphasize killer bravado and generate glee in frantic manifestations of death is, to my mind, a sharp indictment of it as so-called entertainment in this day."
[Year One has] some very funny moments but not enough of them.
"Ultimately, under the guise of maturity, Permission turns a promising premise into a juvenile and destructive display of emotionally immature people."
"It is a true sequel, a film that cannot exist on its own terms, with nothing new to offer except more of the same."
"The movie is open-ended enough to allow for another installment, but what's the point if our hero has nowhere left to go, no more dark personal secrets to uncover, or nothing left to say?"
Laura Dern getting equal screentime is great and the nostalgic elements are hit or miss&#44; but an uninspired script leaves much to be desired&#46;
"Unfortunately, Everest's technical feats aren't matched by a subpar script from William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy."
"An artificial and blatant production that lacks of transcendence, which could not even be cataloged as a curiosity. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Overstays its welcome and feels preposterous, sophomoric, pretentious and barely engaging thanks to the talents of Denzel Washington & Gary Oldman. It might make for a great midnight movie to laugh at given its abundance of absurdity & mindless violence."
A spectacular but empty film. A single scene from David Lynch's failed version - Kenneth McMillan floating in the air and laughing wickedly - is more cinema than this entire movie.
"Between us, I didn't like the picture! Too many of the strong characters have been watered. But, I had fun watching it."
"The ""big reveal"" in Last Night in Soho is the single most unintentionally hilarious film moment of 2021. That's a bad accomplishment in a normal year. It's apocalyptically bad in a year that also features an M. Night Shyamalan movie."
"so-so... delivers a couple of jolts before the dopey finale, which takes place in a steamy, flame-filled cavern that looks alarmingly like Dante's Go-Go Lounge."
"The film is resolutely faithful to details of what Meursault said and did and saw, while missing the essential clipped calm of the style blanc and the precise shading of his detachment."
"The director has attempted to construct quite a complex little film here, but only parts of this delicate concoction work effectively. The movie feels like a strange, lightweight piece of ephemeral fluff."
"Ultimately pointless, this lethargic picture seems to be trying to make a statement but succumbs to its own artiness -- including a cast made up mostly of non-actors."
Yet another video game crashes and burns upon its translation to the big screen with this cinematic rendition of the venerable franchise.
"As laudable as the idealism may be, the movie sometimes feels like a self-congratulatory victory lap."
"It would be acceptable if all this fakeness lead to something legitimately funny. Instead, we're left bemused and bored."
Sucked from the Hollywood buzzword list like a bottom-feeder looking for sludge.
No one talks like that.
A disjointed film that feels as if it decided to changed tack somewhere along the way.
Excruciating
A frustrating melange of styles and themes.
"With only the most minimal of inspection, it's clear that J.H. Wyman's screenplay is a convoluted mess..."
Lots of sex in drama about longtime couple's experiment.
"""The Ottoman Lieutenant"" is all over the map in terms of tone, genre and acting styles."
"For all its surface bravura, Platoon proves a thinly-conceived film thickened out with quantities of visual and visceral rhetoric and war-is-hell philosophizing. "
Reduces a story of triumph over racial prejudice to a standard gung-ho war movie&#46;
Have your little ones already seen Ratatouille and rented Thunderpants?
"Fiennes seems to have opted for a subject a little too close to his heart, and this in turn has clouded his directorial judgement."
"At first, the movie feels and looks inventive -- charming, even -- but when the semi-adorable moppets mutate into morally repugnant adults, its appeal quickly dissipates."
"Too often literal rather than literary, stagey rather than cinematic, Genius can't live up to its title, and ultimately its good intentions are undone by mediocre instincts."
Feeds off a tenuous U2 connection to give a not-very-interesting tale of a rock'n'roll failure a higher profile.
"The movie is far too aware of its influences, especially when it imitates Bring It On's silly ""cheerocracy""-style slang with its own overextended series of aca-neologisms."
It's a bit of a shaggy dog tale and quite a disappointment from this talented director.
"This is a movie for the ear and the eye, not the brain and the heart."
"not unlike the event from which it takes its title. Some of it rekindles memories of what worked in the past in a nostalgic, even sweet way. Some of it reminds one what they liked about these people in the first place. Some of it is just sad."
"""Getaway"" has but one task -- deliver nonstop primo car chases -- and it can't even do that right."
"Even when Walken, Pacino, and Arkin are phoning it in - on a rotary phone - they still earn their status as icons."
"Cuaron tries to touch on a couple dozen of the subplots that so delightfully and leisurely unfold in the book, but here come off like a fast-forwarded highlight reel."
Nobody can't get over the fact that it cast Bob Odenkirk instead of letting the incredibly versatile actor tangle with the meaning of all this carnage. If only it took its own premise more seriously.
An unusually irritating misfire...
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have arrived at a new circle of hell: the one where Martin Lawrence is no longer the most irksome presence in a Martin Lawrence movie."
"However, there is much about director Amanda Lipitz's movie that feels surface level, a trait that feels particularly troubling when her subjects represent issues (namely poverty and systemic racism) that deserve a much deeper dive than they get here."
The film isn't all it could be.
"""Undefeated'' needs less of what we know we've seen (the football stuff) and more of the players' and coaches' lives, which even if we feel we've seen, we haven't."
"Strangers With Candy regularly lampoons junkie-reparation melodramas and after-school specials, but with so little focus it's never clear what the film, or even Sedaris's vaudeville buffoon incarnation, is supposed to be parodying."
End result: You can't believe any of it. And poor Haley Joel Osment. Now he sees dead movies.
"The limited animation style looks static on the big screen and the movie is too long for its age group even at 75 minutes. (It was too long for my age group, too.)"
"It's bad, but at least it's beguilingly bad."
"There is a gentleness here present in all Waititi films, but that soft touch does not quite work in a story dealing with the radioactive idea of racial hate, a theme diluted by the excess of supporting characters and secondary ideas."
"If your kid loves this, your kid needs to read a book, or even, heck, play a video game. At least you can tell video game characters apart."
"'Peter Pan,' 'Alice in Wonderland' return in ways that smack of crass consumerism."
"Damaged individuals healing one another is a serviceable idea for a film, but Things We Lost in the Fire is missing an essential component: plausibility."
"It's a very long way to go for a punch line, but Claude Chabrol fearlessly meanders along for the two hours it takes him to get there"
"While there are some eye-opening moments, not the least of which is a foray into a small town that looks like they're in the midst of a May Day celebration straight out of The Wicker Man, there simply are not enough of them."
"Serena is inconsequential, stilted, and likely being shoved out right now on streaming services due to Cooper and Lawrence starring in the two highest domestic grossing films of 2014."
"Taylor mostly just invents ways for Patton to parade around in skimpy clothes, confusing the tone of the movie, which uses exploitation to eventually condemn exploitation."
Manny is so uninteresting as a pivotal character that he's a black hole who sucks away our investment in the film.
"Given that Judd Apatow is a co-producer, you'd at least expect the film to make you laugh. The humour's all over the place, though."
Deeply mediocre ...
"Alfredson delights in showing ways people's noggins become detached from their bodies, but the queasy unsettling feeling those scenes produce mostly just serves to keep the viewer from falling asleep."
"A harmless coating that simulates telling a lot, but actually narrate very little. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Here the message -- it's not nice to ridicule, mistreat or ignore people just because they're different -- verges on the oppressive; more of the Farrellys' trademark over-the-top comedy would have lightened the load."
"My friend took the 3-D glasses off halfway through, which causes the image to be blurry. I should have tried that. Blurry couldn't have made it worse."
"There is the inkling of a strong, interesting idea here ... but ""Salvation Boulevard"" is itself too loosely tethered to the actual world to make the point with the necessary vigor or acuity."
The Sitter is mediocrity at its finest; too boring to hate and too forgettable to get angry about. Save your money and rewatch Uncle Buck instead.
"The film has potential, but ultimately there's more bark than bite."
"An ordinary, mundane tech thriller whose only distinction is that it's connected to a previous movie. It's the very definition of a sequel nobody wanted."
Without critical support or audience support&#44; Johnson will approach a crossroads&#46; He can continue to sleepwalk through blockbusters&#44; and they will continue to feel like empty calories&#46; Or he can work with directors who will challenge him&#46; 
The energy is sapped by clinging condescension in the guise of compassionate liberalism.
"Dumont ridicules Péguy to end up making an eccentric, perhaps failed, but politically stimulating anti-National Front. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Boils down to cinema as computer game, with Burmese military bad guys held up for target practice. Predictably disappointing."
&#8216;Raymond and Ray&#8217; isn&#8217;t a bad film&#44; but this modest&#44; everyday story feels inauthentic and forced at times&#46;  Still&#44; Verdu and Okonedo are terrific in key supporting roles&#46;
The film is let down by a storyline that strains credulity.
"Disney Studios have found yet another way to rake in audience members' cash without needing to trouble their own creative muscles, let alone reach far into their substantial pockets."
"The far-fetched concept isn't established thoroughly enough to support the weight of the remaining film, and the script - bafflingly - dwells on the most boring part. Nowhere near as good as it thinks it is."
"At least in the end, we'll always have Shame."
Even the 'original' movies this summer feel like sequels.
It's a film that boasts an exceptional cast and gets off to a blistering start before it settles into a lull that lasts until the credits roll.
The experiment's inherent drama is exacted with a tin ear and a cheesy style.
"The veteran actresses who co-star in this stoner comedy have an Oscar and multiple Emmys and Tonys among them, but it's unlikely they'll have to clear any more space on their mantels for Grandma's Boy."
"Some of the movie's problems stem from the fact that the filmmakers can't seem to decide whose story it is, with a constant narrative tug of war between Wade and Ryan's battle for survival and Drillbit's dreams of escaping to Canada."
"The first 20 minutes of Robots are wonderful. Then, Robin Williams shows up and sucks the life out of it."
Eagle Eye occupies a treacherous middle ground. It isn't credible enough to work as a thriller and isn't ridiculous enough to work as a spoof.
"Gives itself away as a cheap, phony melodrama within its first sixty seconds."
"A painful, wearying slice of pure drivel."
The pacing was rough&#44; Clark Griswold is not a fun protagonist to follow and the comedy was all over the place tonally&#46; Randy Quaid is the best thing in this&#44; which is bonkers to say&#46;
To call this feeble comedy a misfire would be to give it more credit than it's due.
"It's pretty much the same movie, minus some of the more egregious '80s fashions."
"Formless and meandering, Siberia is a film without much purpose or promise."
"Because JW isn't the strutting, duplicitous peacock he was in the first movie, the role isn't as rewarding this time out."
"Cub will keep gorehounds happy, but its cruel dismissal of youth makes it disturbing in more ways than it should be."
"In its first half, it is a decidedly effective, spooky tale of tormented ghosts, but it loses its way when de Bont drops all pretenses of subtlety and ramps up the CGI action"
This isn't a terrible movie; it certainly isn't the train wreck bomb of a release I've heard it described as. It just isn't anything great or especially engaging worth recommending.
"While fans of the original work might get into this filmed adaptation, I came in cold and left even chillier in terms of appreciating what the movie was trying to be and how all of that was executed. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)"
"There's no question that everyone had a ball on the set, but the final product doesn't merit all the effort."
"It's enough to keep smaller kids amused, and the ugly vibe that plagued Norbit is thankfully absent."
"Dreary dialogue, over-exposure to Ferrell and Kidman's ill-informed direction to channel Marilyn lite make Bewitched a bad spell at the movies."
"The Extra Man is a disappointment coming from Berman and Pulcini, whose American Splendor was an imaginative biopic about the late comic-book author Harvey Pekar."
"Jennifer Lopez has never looked better. That's about all she does here, is look better. She is talented and deserves more than this bird-brained plot about characters who have no relationship to life as it is lived by, you know, actual people."
"Inundated with liches and lazy plot twists, this Dwayne Johnson vehicle is a complete waste of time."
It&apos;s by no means distinctive&#44; hilarious&#44; or memorable in any way&#44; but&#44; for as cloying as this attempt at Brady brand rehabilitation could have been&#44; it&#8217;s a testament to the magnetic appeal of ageless stars who know how to carry a film to the end zone&#46;
Hudson isn't quite able to carry the film alone.
"Lacking horror and full of failed jump scares, this is another forgettable film by Cage. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile adds nothing new to the Bundy dossier. There are no overarching themes, no fascinating subtext, no discernible character arcs, or any of the other things that make for absorbing drama."
"Watching this movie is like trying to survive on Red Bull and Skittles. It might keep you up for a little bit, but before too long, you'll just want to throw up."
"There are a few sweet moments as the story reaches its unsurprising conclusion. But, all in all, Flakes isn't going to bowl you over."
"Strictly on its own terms, “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” isn’t much."
This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]
"A step down for Berg - heavy on style, but regrettably low on substance. If you're looking for a violent action fix, ""Mile 22"" will certainly get the job done, but it will leave you feeling empty as the final credits roll."
I felt myself age. I did not feel myself laugh.
"Has nothing to do with The Beatles' 'All You Need Is Love.' Based on the movie's low quantity of romance, it may as well be called The Walrus I Am."
It all makes for a decidedly underwhelming experience.
"The White Ribbon doesn't resonate at all. The filmmaker's doom-laden view of humanity -- that we are all unredeemably awful creatures, easily swayed to do dastardly things -- oozes with contempt."
"For a movie where so much occurs in the first 30 minutes, the pace still tends to drag and, at times, is as slow as hell. A lot of these problems can be attributed to Affleck's stilted screenplay that never quite finds the right tone."
"I felt like taking my felt pen to the film's poster and turning the overindulged star's name into ""J'aime pas Winstone""."
Someone once said the only thing worse than nuclear war was Evelyn Waugh. Maybe they'd seen this.
Big mistake.
"A romantic comedy with dramatic overtones saturated with stereotypical beings, a few funny situations, some inevitable entanglements and the redemption of all. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"In the last half-hour, the story, like the Japanese, loses its way; lacking any clear-cut goals except survival, the film becomes repetitive. Letters From Iwo Jima is a necessary movie; too bad it's not a great movie."
"The message gets muddled with plot strands going every which way, though the real culprit is some awkward animation."
"The best rejoinder to Public Enemies is Michael Jackson's Smooth Criminal video... It's a tommy-gun gangster fantasia with a touch of Guys and Dolls, and it's everything Public Enemies isn't."
"Okay, I've been reminded that I don't like Michael Bay's directing style. That's the last reminder I will need for the next ten years or so."
"I'm sure there's a lot more life in his technique, as well as different signature techniques he might develop in future films. Sunset is a sophomore slump but the lessons of this misstep might just make his next film stronger."
"Everything must pass through the filter of Phoebe, who is basically inexpressive and unlikable."
The wee'uns may enjoy the forest-based capers but for adults this is no pickernick.
"The blandness of story and lack of intensity with action makes Fuqua's ""Magnificent Seven"" anything but magnificent."
Nothing about Rugrats Go Wild is particularly bad or crass; it's just exhaustingly mediocre.
There&apos;s Something Wrong With the Children is fine as it is for a casual watch&#44; but it&#8217;s painful to watch such a talented cast trying to salvage a bland horror film that had so much potential to be unforgettable&#46;
A &#8216;critique&#8217; of misogyny that is outright misogynist&#44; even before it goes down a gorefest rabbit hole of infuriating contempt for women&#46; What the hell is going on with this would-be-mythic mishmash&#63;
"There's no questioning the high-octane energy of Garth Jennings' star-studded ensemble, but the cacophony grows a little tiresome. The show can go on, but that doesn't mean it must."
"The Offering is a bland rehash of ""inspirations"" from past horror films, none of which are re-imagined with much to offer."
"On the film rumbles, raising a few more smiles than moments when you want to wince in discomfort or eat cyanide, but only a few."
"It's been a while since we saw a truly boggling sophomore slump, one of those infamous second-act follies, like Steven Soderbergh's Kafka, made by adirector blinded with ego and overreach."
"The latest in Nicolas Cage's apparently inexhaustible supply of B-movie potboilers... Nameless people move around a lot in 'Running With the Devil,' but the end result is drearily aimless."
"So much for subtlety, not to mention sensitivity to stereotypes."
Wilmer Valderrama and George Takei's reaction shots are the only feeble sources of humor in this dramedy.
"Al Pacino and Robert De Niro seem to make this schlock palatable, but for everyone thinking Righteous Kill is going to be the next Heat, you're going to be left burnt. It's more like a bad episode of Law & Order."
"Perhaps, one day we will see the disabled in all their hues, in stories that truly are theirs, not churned out for our easy digestion."
Netflix's Army of the Dead is a failed genre homecoming for [Zack] Snyder after 17 years.
"This desperately needed a Diablo Cody touch. Well... at least we still have ""Tully""."
...feels like a promising (if brazenly derivative) sci-fi actioner that was at some crucial point hijacked by the ego of a desperately needy superstar.
"More than competently mounted, with a hollowness just discernible in its core... feels like the first draft of whatever film Michael Mann set out to make."
"A thuddingly joyless experience that feels twice as long, with a leaden pace, an awful script & phoned in performances."
"Lara Croft is a stern, all-knowing, effortlessly competent &#252;ber-babe &#151; but you wouldn't want to know her."
Save yourself a few dollars. Stay home and watch reruns of Home Improvement.
"As a former film critic, Lurie presumably knows how to communicate ideas, but there's an unbridgeable gap between the movie he thinks he's made and the movie he's actually made."
Hollywood needs to realize that it's not the '40s anymore; women don't need a man to be happy.
"Everyone's too mannered, and most everything's too slow. Especially for a throwback."
A mixed bag is maybe the best you can accomplish when you set out to structurally thread two storylines into one film&#44; or rather when your film has to sustain two mirrored arcs whose intersection is the endpoint&#46; 
"As usual, Billy Bob is very watchable in the lead. But the rest of the film is only so-so."
"Easily the best studio confection of the year... kicking ***, taking names, and reminding us all of the joy that going to a big summer movie is supposed to inspire in us."
"Sheen and Nighy do their best with the material, but this is easily the worst Underworld so far."
"Knotty and tense for most of its running time, Omar becomes muddled in its closing minutes, conflating personal and political treachery."
Cute boy and girl opposites meet and fall in love after their best friends die and leave them in charge of raising their orphaned daughter. Adorable.
Headlining a less-than-mediocre kids' movie taints one's brand rather than enhancing it. Just ask Shaq.
"In answer to the cinematic question Are We Done Yet? one can only answer, 'Let's hope so.'"
The Whole Nine Yards does not go the distance.
"I am sick to death of the clueless, arrogant buffoon that Will Ferrell has made his stock-in-trade, and desperate to see the talented comic do something -- anything -- else."
"The dramatic tension is nil. But the performances, particularly by Hunt (in a non-comedic role, for a change), are worth a look."
A decision by filmmakers to fully turn the Fantasy Island concept into a half-cocked horror movie buys the entire doomed enterprise a one-way ticket to the bottom of the barrel.
I hate Safe Haven. It's a terrible thing to do to your Valentine.
"Corporate Animals feels like it was written as a spec script for a sitcom that ended up being stretched out for a feature film, much to the detriment of the narrative."
So note-perfect are the performances from all the cast in I've Loved You So Long that you want them to inhabit a film that is somehow less contrived and more honest.
Fans of Chan's martial arts prowess and deft physical comedy will find very little to enjoy here.
Pretty tepid entertainment.
Clayburgh and Tambor are charming performers; neither of them deserves Eric Schaeffer.
"Another ""was supposed to be in multiplexes"" streaming premiere that's so bad it qualifies as a mitzvah to movie theaters."
"Even with Oscar Isaac's good performance, it doesn't have the energy or dynamism that characterizes the Coens' style. [Full review in Spanish]"
[Hate Story 1 & 2] were terrible films but at least they were not absolute zeroes. Hate Story 3 adds up to zilch.
There's a flatness to the filmmaking; what's needed here is a lot more va-va in its va-va-voom.
"The movie is too tidy to ever really feel like a living, breathing thing."
Originality should always triumph over retreading familiar territory&#59; especially when it seems like Scream&apos;s kills and major plot points are being plunged into the same stab wounds&#46;
There's a pleasing patina of pure schlock that almost -- and I stress almost -- makes Undiscovered watchable.
...sporadically amusing yet pervadingly tedious...
"If religious films aren't your bailiwick, stay away. Otherwise, this could be a passable date film."
"What a different, livelier movie this would be if Smith got jiggy with ['A Friend Like Me'], and applied some ""Fresh Prince"" rap stylings."
"Amid the entertainment value of excessively chaotic anarchy, the story is painfully far away from smart satire."
Some things should be left in the past and forgotten. Case in point: Tarzan.
The Transporter Refuelled has a good core but not much more.
"Sadly, the fun is far too limited to the sugar high variety."
"While it might be the height of critical cliché (and analytically wrong) to call G.I. Joe: Retaliation ""a real American Zero,"" if the combat boot fits..."
"Neither as funny nor as scary as it should be. There are some good gore gags and charming performances, but it's just a little too little."
"Beyond its tardy, fitful contribution to the undead evolution, this teen flick's apparently never heard of the actual women's revolution. So we're treated to some B-horror fun here and there, increasingly buzzkilled by horny-moan, male-it-in humour."
Overly pretentious.
"When [Catherine] Keener's Mary Weston suggests that Lopez may be exploiting Ayers, it is tempting to wonder how the filmmakers would react to the same accusation."
"Given its garish production history, one rather expected The Cotton Club to sing with hot-jazz desperation. Instead, we get the mediocre craftsmanship of a pit band in Vegas."
"Intriguing character nuances are continually brushed against without deeper exploration, all in service of an ending that’s not really scary, sad, or disturbing so much as a resigned shrug of abnegation."
"While it's not hard to envision how the ideas in the movie could result in something compelling, the execution is lacking."
"This star-studded docudrama about President Kennedy's assassination and its aftermath focuses on fascinating, relatively obscure stories, but fails to organize them into effective and revealing drama."
The questions here are good; it's the answers that feel like a cheat.
Confidence missteps in so many ways that you don't have to be a chess player to see ten moves ahead.
"For proprietary reasons ""Toasted Os"" can't taste exactly like Cheerios and ""Hillbilly Holler"" doesn't quite have the kick of Mountain Dew. Onward tastes more like a knockoff of brand name, rather than a true Pixar picture."
"Imagine Time Bandits confined to a boring Berkshire village and drained of colour, and you can see why this pig's ear of Susan Cooper's well-received children's story went belly-up at the US box office."
Zac Stanford's screenplay works only as a theorem proving Murphy's Law.
"The primary irritant here is Perry, whose performance is the cinematic equivalent of listening to fingernails scrape a chalkboard for two hours."
Zoey Deutch is too convincing as the gotta be an influencer&#46; You don&apos;t like her and you don&apos;t like the movie&#46;
It's almost a good movie.
"Dwayne Johnson is in Peak Dad mode in Skyscraper, a movie that is sometimes thrilling, mostly boring, and possibly underwritten by the duct-tape lobby."
Any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things.
"Despite all the heavy breathing and mood lighting, Basic Instinct 2 is so dull that you might find yourself easily distracted by side issues."
"The character's self-destructive, self-centered side echoes much of Downey's recent, real-life excess. His obvious talent makes you hope he can put his problems behind him -- and go on to a better film."
"The eponymous ""girl"" is the only reason to see this dull, misconceived drama that centers on a defamed male journalist who takes a job with a rich industrialist."
"First-time director Hue Rhodes, who shifted from a career in IT to go to film school, invests too much screen time pursuing the quirky rather than nailing down a story."
Mediocre drama centered a young woman's introduction to the porn industry.
...a more hyperbolic ode to male loserdom...
Bad pulp that results in flaccid fiction.
The battle of the sexes is restaged to clever but inconsequential effect in Conversations With Other Women.
"I'm Shocked, SHOCKED to discover Fox News is conservative!!!"
Plot exposition is delivered by Stallone over random detonations. My kingdom for an ear trumpet?
"If the Thor crazy persists, audiences may finally realize how weird all this stuff is."
"It rides a one-trick reindeer that tires well before the second reel, and it mistakes crudity and cruelty for humour."
"THE ZERO THEOREM is far from adding up to nothing. But the underlying message feels both contemporary and passé, and for a Gilliam film it feels oddly prosaic."
"Has a few too many balls in the air, and a few too many plot threads randomly started or abruptly ended. It feels at times like two separate movies awkwardly scotch-taped together."
A vain and vapid intellectual exercise that only serves to illustrate Lars von Trier's unswerving arrogance.
"..excels in period atmosphere and photography...But there's also a lack of drive and urgency in Techine's direction, which become most obvious in the muffled ending."
If as much money had gone into the screenplay as must have gone into the paying for the star voices we might have ended up with something less mundane.
It is a fleeting experience&#44; one that is primarily bolstered by a committed central performance from Kier and not much else to remember&#46;
"Gorgeous food and scenery, but not a lot else."
"It's mercilessly over-edited action unfolds with a tight-budget fury on two-and-a-half levels of a parking garage, and the result is dull, stupidly violent and dreadfully repetitive."
"Alas, good Hitchcock touches no longer make a good Hitchcock film, and Curtain falls, more redolent of mothballs than mystery."
An homage-o-rama so focused on looping in references and actors from past series installments that it forgets to tell its own story.
"Is there an actual character in Black Hawk Down? The story stars a battalion of 'our boys,' depicted only as stereotypes by screenwriter Ken Nolan."
"There's a great film to be made out of the Winchester story, but sadly this isn't it."
"Instead of being exhilarating, the excesses become exhausting."
"This movie might have been more persuasive if the boy had told the story of the horse, instead of the horse telling the story of the boy."
"Generic plot, meaningless action, overdone CGI, forgettable villain. The camaraderie of the first of the three in short supply. Only Karl Urban scores."
"It is a cinematic oddity, insofar its genre and tone are atypical for animation. Unfortunately, what is unique is not necessarily worthwhile."
"A film that, independently of anything else it gets right or wrong, is at least slightly dismal as an aesthetic object."
Works as a thriller for anyone who lives entirely in the present. Those with longer memories will find the film grows increasingly funny as it rolls along.
"Predictably, the derivative title here is a jumping-off point for another derivative slasher-revenge pic."
LaBute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public.
Just a bunch of spotty sketches slapped together that will satisfy no one except the diehards.
"It's hard not to shrug, stifle a yawn and reach for the popcorn when the Golden Gate Bridge once again buckles and sways and drops vehicles into the bay."
"Dark, dingy, overly violent, unpleasant and unfathomable. In all, not a pretty picture."
"Few expected Basic Instinct 2 to be very good, but no one expected it to be this boring."
The film is made confusing not only by the twisting plot but by the varied styles of the three cult directors.
"Estevez's true kindred spirit... is novelist Arthur Hailey... the political themes in Estevez's film are frequently submerged in soap suds: Despite all its noble ideas, 'Bobby' is less like 'JFK' than it is 'Days of Our Lives.'"
I think it's safe to say that the concerns about sexism in cinema that Heigl voiced so ardently after her career-making turn in Knocked Up have ebbed in direct proportion to the increases in her subsequent paychecks.
"There's a pleasant surprise involving Here Comes the Boom. No, it's not particularly good -- that would rank as a miracle more than a surprise -- but it does showcase Kevin James in his most appealing turn since 2005's Hitch."
"With a plot that's virtually identical to parts 1, 2 and 3, this fourth movie has one new gimmick that makes it worth a look: it's in 3D. And the filmmakers have a lot of fun with it, gleefully revving up the grisly carnage."
"Pirates of the Caribbean is a movie that you ride around in circles for 2 hours and 23 minutes, until at last it brings you back where you began, exhausted and a lot dizzier."
The leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting.
A decidedly average film with flashes of inspiration.
"Polished, ultimately unfulfilling film."
Hit and miss humour with problematic undertones buoyed by an intriguing premise and appealing performances from the film's human cast.
"A werewolf film, completely neutered."
"If it wasn't for some exciting roundball action, Shaquille O'Neal's hulking-dunking presence and a wonderfully guttural performance from coach Nick Nolte, you'd slither off the bench asleep."
"The writing is unfortunate, attempting clever repartee between the attractive stars, but just succeeding in making everyone slightly embarrassed."
"There are no revelations or surprises, just newspaper editorial-style lamentations disguised as cautionary tales. I'd rather watch racism push Sandra Bullock down the stairs in Crash."
"Richard Ayoades ironical voice work goes some way to saving it, but this remains a shamelessly anaemic half-term diversion. Didnt we decide that kids deserved better a few decades back?"
"Sadly, not even Pine's relentless charm and a brief, dimly lit and way over-hyped full-frontal scene can save the movie."
"One of those throw-everything-at-the-screen-and-see-if-anything-sticks movies...In this case, nothing does...All terrible--puerile, vulgar and unfunny."
"Except for a few death-defying special effects, it's two-plus hours of yo-ho-ho and a bottle of dumb."
"Just like the real experiment, the film starts out well, then gets progressively out of control before dissolving into chaos."
"Despite half-hearted moves towards providing a new take on a classic story, Victor Frankenstein is less ""aliiiiiive!"" than trapped in a coma of its own making."
"Holds a handful of chilling scenes and unforgettable images, but its cumulative effect is one of disappointment and missed opportunities."
Riiight. Who's up for some Parcheesi?
Borrowing from Agatha Christie&apos;s &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot;&#44; this is a who&apos;s next movie that goes nowhere&#46;
"It's exhausting trying to wade through a movie where every statement is delivered like a treatise. Life, death, sex, money, murder, what does it all mean? In the end it means nothing."
Robert De Niro is having sex with Carla Gugino. I know. It's like witnessing a traffic accident where an Edsel keeps slamming into a shiny red Corvette.
Deep under the skin of this shrug of a movie is a solid metaphor rooted in an appealing fantasy.
"Just like the Stock Market, this movie suffers from some pretty scary highs and lows."
"As weird as the story is, it’s been made all the stranger by the decision to turn it into a metaphor about fascism, a conceit that is as politically incoherent as it is unfortunately timed."
The only positive thing that can be said about director Mads Brügger is that he is self-aware.
"This has nothing but pretty pictures, and is extremely dull."
"Parker's approach is never dull, exactly. But it's never remarkable enough to overwhelm the suspicion that you're not being told a story here so much as being sold a career."
"Spinning Into Butter is the perfect example of a movie taking an interesting premise and, through incompetence of acting, writing and directing, turning it into an unwatchable mess."
"The project as a whole is a lot less mawkish than we've come to expect from Wilder's directorial efforts. Still, it ain't exactly state of the art."
"...patched together from hand-me-down remnants. Director Roy William Neill and the writers seem to be just going through the motions while waiting for that final smack from the clapboard. Rathbone delivers a magnetic performance to the bitter end, though."
An interesting production but not a good movie.
"Tame is what Magic Mike’s Last Dance is -- what it apparently wants to be, what it becomes in exchange for its new, cardboard-simple, ostensible pro-woman worldview. The movie’s pleasures mute themselves beneath its good intentions."
"The Island, which belabors itself for about 45 minutes before you have any idea what's afoot, is a clone itself - of Coma, a '70s medical thriller that once seemed so far-fetched it had to be sci-fi."
The Tunnel starts out strong&#44; sticking to the disaster film formula with style and efficient characterization&#46; It stumbles midway through&#44; however&#44; falling victim to pacing issues and mawkishness that undermine the promise of the first half&#46;
...another comic book movie with a lot of special effects. ...a complete waste of time.
It becomes impossible to care about what Lyra and her mates are doing when the dialogue is designed to do nothing but push you forward to the next film.
"While Sutherland's addled John makes for a surprisingly assured pilot of the couple's old RV, Virzi's film veers all over the map, too frequently straining the limits of taste...Mirren and Sutherland make a great pair, but they need another vehicle."
"The movie will probably find a modest audience for a weekend or two, but it could have been so much bigger if it didn't reduce senior citizens to sympathetic data cards. If it truly gave us something to see."
weighed down with so much grit and gloom that there's no fun left
It's obvious that screenwriter Knate Lee started and ended his thought process for this plot with a gimmick.
By the time we reach the largely predictably dark ending of Sucker Punch I was fairly begging for my own lobotomy.
"...formulaic beach-read of a movie populated by one-dimensional cliches...may have seemed merely subpar had it been released by a major, but bearing the usually so reliable Sony Pictures Classics label makes it loathsome."
"'Hall Pass' is like a late-'60s Bob Hope or Jerry Lewis movie, stubbornly grinding out what used to work, current styles be damned."
"Good Will Hunting but in the Midwest and minus the tortured math genius, psychological breakthroughs, and convincing local color."
A smothering pall of corruption and futility.
"The idea is interesting, but the execution is too tacky to make it fly."
"How could such good intentions result in such an unconvincing, deadeningly obvious morass? Ask the triple-threat-against-decent-filmmaking at the forefront."
"Well, all I can say is that all that talent doesn't quite come together, as they all, no doubt, imagined and hoped."
"There's a momentum to Rough Night that is pleasing enough, but the bar for comedy should be set higher, and this cliché-filled outing never quite clears it."
Not even bad enough to be funny&#44; this is just plain boring&#46;
"Sure, references to ""Glee"" and Robert Downey Jr.'s drug years may not hold up quite as well in 20 years, but in an era of disposable pop culture, ""21 Jump Street"" is anything but, likely to be namechecked for a lot longer."
"The human story told in the documentary Life, Animated has ample inspirational value but on the other hand there's something deeply uncomfortable about the whole enterprise."
"Considering the sunny, relatively pleasurable romantic business that precedes it, the elderly stuff seems dark, morbid, and forced upon us."
"Its merely plot-driven depictions of its residents converges with Ly's merely functional direction, to flatten ""Les Misérables"" into the undistinguished style of conventionally apolitical and socially indifferent conventional crime dramas."
A dud of a comedy that wastes a top-notch cast on a ridiculous premise.
Into the Blue is just dumb fun in the sun.
"With the movie industry recycling old movie plots one after another, it makes you wonder, have they run out of original ideas?"
"The film is a hoot, even if it is for all the wrong reasons -- I laughed quite a lot when I shouldn't have -- but I would have liked some logic. Any logic. Internal or external, but there truly isn't any."
"It has a good message, but it's hypocrisy because the film celebrates exactly what it's condemning"
The story seems like yet another flimsy excuse for the aging auteur to show us how hip and sexually liberated he is.
"Swinton Byrne's performance is itself compelling, but she's also deprived of material with which to build anything real."
"While there are some funny sequences, the horror really struggles to live up. Worst of all, this movie drags, despite the movie only lasting an hour and forty minutes."
"As refreshing as it is not to see a comic book, slam-banger movie this close to summer releases, the talky 'True Story' could use some movement. Adapting it as a stage play seems more plausible."
"A silly, schlocky, mummy's-tomb horror-comedy."
"The Ides of March is uninspiring to write about. While it is not one of those films that has you looking at your watch every few minutes, it is essentially conservative and inert."
"Hard-hitting in all the worst ways, like being repeatedly thumped by a randomly furious street hawker."
"A lack of irony can be refreshing, even thrilling, but 'Red Tails' is flat, in a way that has become almost a Lucas trademark. The Tuskegee Airmen deserve a more memorable and less cornball tribute than this."
"Don Peyote is a delusional, hallucinogenic journey into the mind of an apocalypse obsessed lunatic - a jumbled puzzle of ideas missing a few crucial connections."
"Vox Lux is a movie that makes you ask the question, Why am I supposed to care about any of this?"
"The at-times slow and indulgent pacing of Cairo Time will frustrate a few viewers, even if the Egyptian landmarks and scenery is stunning."
Rebooting The Matrix for a 2021 audience could be great. This was not.
The very definition of a meaningless&#44; mindless summer sequel&#46;
"The scenery is glorious, but the movie's a hard slog all the same."
"This film lives down to my expectations, with a ludicrous plot involving civic pride and a neutron bomb, and a final twist so risible that it almost turns the whole thing into a comedy."
"Its a bit like a hastily and inexpertly assembled jigsaw puzzle. While the overall picture is obvious, the individual pieces dont fit into place, and after awhile, you stop caring."
"Dreary, flat, oversimplified, uninspired. Surely the failure of Oldboy will prove many right who decried this remake years ago. I wonder what a more nuanced, imaginative director might've done with a script that wasn't dumbed down for the masses?"
"It's got great vocal talent and well-done animation, but it proves once again that the story is the key ingredient."
"Carrey and Leoni don't achieve much chemistry, mostly because she's so busy playing straight man to his antics."
Neither boring enough to qualify as pornography nor vital enough to generate a controversy.
"There's no build-up or suspense leading to the final showdown, and the details of the projects fly by without registering."
"Streep is... pitch perfect. Much like her Julia Child in Julie and Julia, she goes way beyond impersonation. But even Streep can't single-handedly give depth and nuance to a movie so briskly content with skimming surfaces both political and psychological."
"It's a visual marvel and, like the Energizer Bunny, never stops going, but in the end proves more exhausting than exhilarating."
Shows an impressive turn of speed in places but runs out of puff before the finishing line.
"It's a film that never tries to be anything more than an entertaining lark, and only fitfully succeeds at that."
"Sands' movie reaches for charm and profundity, but both elude the story and direction that veers into unsophisticated, amateurish choices."
Takes the social commentary even further and in the process makes the silliness less enjoyable.
"Writer-director Dan Harris attempts a juggling act of tone, style and genre that results in about half a dozen different movies being shuffled across the screen, none of which -- despite fine performances all around -- really works."
"The camera creeps and swoops around Pitt and Bana, as if they're Kirk and Spock in some kind of hyper-realized ""Amok Time."""
"The single theme is ""Isn't this cool?"" And if your response is, ""Well, it's certainly loud,"" then ""On Any Sunday"" probably isn't for you."
Less amusing than a game of license plate bingo.
Clancy's world is strictly for the techno-nerds and frankly they're welcome to it.
"A failure of form, style, content, detail, humor and emotion, the film betrays the people it hopes to portray -- workaday folks struggling to overcome addictions and start their lives anew."
Bekmambetov's disposable brouhaha at least achieves the minor victory of living neither up to hopes nor down to fears.
What might have been a pretty heady work quickly gives way to shameless manipulation and a screenplay that's both sloppy and contrived.
"Tedious, overstuffed, visually flat ... emotionally inert, filled with painfully expository dialogue and mostly poorly acted, it's simply an all-around misfire."
"At best, The Class is great reality TV."
"Munna Michael may pass muster as an industrially sculpted film meant for entertainment, but its underlying normalisation and glorification of street violence, male entitlement and dismissal of consent could be lethal."
"Completely satisfying, entirely unsurprising, and says all there is to say about itself by the fact of itself."
Writer-director Jonathan Kasdan can't even bother to satisfy the buildup with a real moment of consummation (welcome to the fade to black) or believable postcoital complications.
"Elements of threat are established, yet everything in the picture is frustratingly ephemeral, unwilling to foster menace in a manner that reflects Kevin's own growing evil."
"Finally, we are freed of this franchise."
It's wholesome but starchy fare: a story of sacrifice and good fortune that feels less like a movie than a marketing vehicle for the power of divine providence.
"An underwhelming, sci-fi adventure more akin to After Earth than District 9."
"They say that war is hell. Nevertheless, hell takes on a different kind of connotation when watching the boisterous and banal wartime actioner Mile 22."
"A spectacle blatantly predicated on a smug gaggle of mega movie stars in boss threads ostentatiously having fun by pretending to steal the house's money, while actually taking yours."
"This may be the first movie that would have been better off if it had cast actor Brian Baker, the Verizon Wireless 'Can you hear me now?' guy, as its young lead."
"Convoluted, contrived and cliche'-ridden, evoking Robert Frost's ""Home is the place where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in."""
"Guy Ritchie has just given us the trashiest and most impudent vulgarization of King Arthur anyone is ever likely to see in a zillion-dollar movie, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword."
Sheridan's distinct artistry of dialogue is sorely missing.
"Ratatouille has imaginative animation, creative characters, but the use of a gray rat and his garbage-eating family is questionable."
"You've seen better mysteries on Murder She Wrote, you'll hear better dialogue in an Ed Wood flick, and you'll experience better sex scenes on a hot day at your local zoo."
Isn't all that romantic and is only half as funny as it thinks it is.
"By the time the sun goes down on this peculiarly small-seeming fable, not even Curtis' usual tear-jerking tenderness is there to cushion the blow; your guitar will be the only thing that gently weeps."
"Adapting his own novel, [director] Davlin seems blessedly unaware of how silly his story is, attacking it with such escalating melodramatic fervor that Memory rises from the disastrously campy to the bizarrely hypnotic."
"As clunky as the CGI Clifford is, the script is even clunkier. It feels like the screenwriters couldn't figure out how to make a feature-length Clifford movie so they just crammed in as many plot threads as they could to fill time."
Just crap
"While it gets credit for audacity, the film suffers from amateurish performances and ignores the ethical ramifications of its characters' behavior."
Last Chance Harvey certainly won't rank among the better script selections made by this impressive cast.
"By adapting the segments into a script, the story seems choppy and lacks some dynamics. Despite a series of comic catastrophes, Wilson never seems to grow or develop."
"By movie's end, I had whiplash from the movie's lurches between frivolity and seriousness."
"Overall, The Guard is worth seeing for its actors and some of its smart dialogue, but sometimes it becomes smart-ass past the point of many viewers' enjoyment."
Cold War body horror is a congealed homage to many far better films
"Emerging from the Job-like endurance test of this film's unrelenting horror, it's impossible not to be moved by its visceral impact ..."
"At about half the length of the original 'Black Stallion,' it provides about 50% of its entertainment value, but the scenery is impressive in the big-screen format."
"It's perhaps too easy to dismiss 'Awake' as a snoozer, but unfortunately it's also completely accurate."
"The resulting fragmented mess will no doubt keep some in stitches, but it is definitely less than the sum of its body parts."
"Nevertheless, God's Not Dead 2 cannot overcome its unintentional cheesiness, manufactured compassion and one-sided ideology that fails to allow any formidable counter punch to its theoretical and theological insights."
"Pick a subplot, any subplot -- at various times, they're all given equal weight, and the result is a meandering, dull disaster instead of anything resembling a narrative."
"The ending section, where Schnack and Azerrad let Cobain ramble philosophically about life and music, is a muddled intellectual mess."
You're unlikely to react with much more than a shrug.
"There is simply no reason to waste your money on this movie, which wouldn't be worth seeing if it were the only thing showing in town."
"It's one more cheesy, broadly played, poorly paced, instantly forgettable August action movie."
"As always, it falls on Jeremy Piven's big-hearted menace, Ari Gold, to be the defibrillator amidst all the lifeless recliner action."
"It's boring. It's derivative. It's chaotic. It's a franchise that's been running on fumes for eight years. With this entry, the fuel gauge has finally hit empty."
"Too much about obstacles, not enough about people, and has one scene too many featuring hired goons. To clarify, one scene with hired goons is one too many in something like this."
"...a gigantic egg, though no one looks more pleased with it than Myers."
...the movie doesn't entirely go off the rails until the first major shoot-out rolls around...
Great actors stuck in predictable road-trip flick.
The movie looks as if it's been written by committee and edited with a chainsaw.
"The screenplay by Goyer himself, who wrote Blade and co-wrote The Dark Knight, this time doesn't limber up."
"A decent film, but hardly the breakthrough anti-slavery masterpiece many have claimed. It's difficult to stay in the brutal reality with A-list movie stars around every bend."
A puzzling psychological thriller pointing out the vast differences between generations&#46;
the quintessential product by and for uninspired times
"Caught up in its own self-satisfied metaphor, its blank canvas and broadly sketched melancholic tones an empty vessel for those who would automatically turn the personal into the political."
"a deliberate throwback to 1940s war movies, but not in a good way"
"Bogdanovich leaves the ""funny"" out of She's Funny That Way, producing instead a surprisingly dull 90-minutes."
Imagine Susan Sontag falling in love with Howard Stern.
...Strictly remainder-bin material.
"While it's watchable, this convoluted and contrived speculative piece is not the ideal reteaming for Bourne Supremacy star Matt Damon and that film's director, Paul Greengrass."
"The whole affair plods along in by-the-numbers fashion, and the characters are all types, displaying little evidence of interior lives."
"I haven't read the book, but can only presume it's a heck of a lot better than this messy and morose film."
"Walk the Line will no doubt appeal to Cash's legion of fans. As for the rest of us, there's not much here to chew on."
"Loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes, twitchy acting, and general boorishness."
It just goes on too long to support what is essentially a one-joke premise.
Barely better than the Wikipedia page describing the plot.
"The Matrix franchise, founded on a stylish sense of cool, has suddenly reinvented itself in the nerdy image of Star Wars."
full review at Movies for the Masses
More of a marketing sensation than a cinematic one...a documentary shouldn't feel this packaged.
This swinging between extreme silliness and the poker-faced hero worship of Ip Man the character makes this more an exercise in pastiche than a movie.
"I can only speak for myself, but I couldn't tear my eyes away from this Euro-art train wreck."
"Given the amount of time Bynes spends mugging and overselling her lines, a more accurate title would have been 'She's the Ham.'"
"Not quite a complete write-off, but basically a folly."
...a fascinating yet strangely unsatisfying film.
"Only Grohl himself demonstrates more than a “good sport” level of acting talent, while cameos by people like Will Forte and Lionel Ritchie only brighten matters as much as their so-so material allows. "
"Poorly written and simplistically acted, the film also shows little chemistry between real-life couple Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman."
True fans probably don't need the tangled universe of good versus evil explained to them: Bionic aliens rumble; ancient monuments crumble; guys in the middle of robot Armageddon deliver wry one-liners. That's just what you do when things go boom.
"When you're telling a story about people as well-documented as the English royals, it's difficult to achieve a fresh outlook; and unfortunately Mr. Hooper and screenwriter David Seidler don't quite succeed."
"As an action thriller, the Accountant does little more than balance its books."
"Chapter 3 will no doubt resonate with Insidious fans who have been wanting to know how it all began. For myself, when it comes to prologues, I'm still holding out for the backstory on Jaws and the long-rumoured Keyser Söze: The Early Years."
All it proves is that on their home turf the Pangs can make an international hit-man tale every bit as trashy and dull as the ones made in Hollywood or Europe.
"Like Elvis Presley, Prince has the charisma to carry an atrocious movie-real fans just want to see him-but even Elvis never got so carried away with himself that he thought he could direct."
"Snyder's Army of the Dead delivers some compelling action and shocking visuals, but isn't clever or fun enough to be more than a shallow zombie flick."
The script fritters away frights and suspense as if that isn't the whole point of it all.
"The biggest letdown, is Williams, whose manic improvisations now bear all the hallmarks of a pub bore."
"A typically fragmented film from Terrence Malick, about a screenwriter (Christian Bale) in a spiritual crisis."
Both a facile observation on teen love and a bland observaton on the dangers of protective parenting.
"The sparkling blue waters are pretty, and the songs are catchy, but you may well wind up feeling smothered by the non-stop corniness of it all."
Gilliam's film is trapped somewhere between fable and comedy. It's as if he is so entranced by his own visual inventiveness that he completely loses sight of his storytelling.
"Near the end of the film, it was also very obvious that they had either run out of time or budget since the movie started looking like a video game cut scene."
"Naim's direction is as pedestrian as his screenplay, and his inexperience at working with actors surfaces in the one-note performances."
"The shock of recognition dissipates, to be replaced by the glance at the wristwatch."
"Dying Young is sort of Love Story by way of Pretty Woman: Poor girl from the uneducated side of the tracks meets rich, dying young man who hires her to be his companion. From there you can probably write it yourself."
"Crazy Love has a tabloid story to kill for, and a basic nonfiction form to snooze over."
"While its performances are entertaining and premise is engaging, Salmon Fishing in the Yemen doesn't pack enough punch in its political satire or depth in its love story to sustain itself."
A touchy-feely cabinet of wonders which occasionally enraptures but also drags.
"This might just be the wish of a former horse rider, but I'd much rather spend more time with Black Beauty than with Jo or any of the other human characters in her path."
"The anti-Matrix, celebrating obeisance to random yet tethering nostalgia within a river of brands and platforms and delusions from the 1980s, critiquing lightly but eventually embracing the machine: any machine."
"A noirish romance, bathed in new age trance music and trippy golden light, Code 46 feels like Blade Runner on meds."
It&#8217;s a shaggy dog story in the classic sense&#44; only the dog in question is a bit of a mutt&#46;
"The whole thing is annoying and bad. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Sexual Content, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
Makes you feel like you're trapped at dinner with a wiseass who's trying to convince you what a sensitive guy he is.
Meet the Fockers is stuck somewhere between being absolutely hilarious and one of the worst comedies ever committed to celluloid.
The film stumbles in its first few minutes and falls apart soon after.
Yawn.
"Happiest Season is a sloppy, regressive mess full of one-note characters. This film sends all the wrong messages about tolerance in the year 2020."
"During one of the longer sleuthing scenes I wondered, ""When is the pacing building suspense and when is it building tedium?"""
...your Gimme-a-Break meter will probably be red-lined long before director Mennan Yapo drags you over the shaggy-dog finish line.
It's like catching up with an old friend and remembering why you don't hang out with him anymore: He's stuck in a rut and he has nothing new to say.
[T]he endeavour quickly degenerates into a gory and increasingly alienating splatter-filled shoot'em-up.
"First time writer/director Nnegest Likke has her heart in the right place, but the intensity of her inexperience blinds every scene."
The remainder of Andrew Niccol's film is so conservatively directed that the opening's audacious style is missed.
"An amateurish, quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video."
the kind of ersatz entertainment that will make you wish you were stuck in a mile-long line at the mall or listening to a long set of carols sung by tone-deaf kids.
"The film wants to replicate the earlier films moral arc, but ends up playing to the double standards it's trying to combat."
This two hour&#44; 46 minute long film is the cinematic equivalent of the 748 page novel upon which it is based&#58; both contain a mercilessly prevaricated chain of violence&#44; abuse and assault&#44; reducing Marilyn to little more than a tragic victim&#46; Why&#63;
Approaches something important and refuses to be interesting.
"Most of the time, this mess is about as much fun as being with a bunch of drunken frat boys who are talking back to a martial-arts film."
"Despite a potpourri of minor delights, the film ends up a disappointment."
"Cassavetes seemingly tries to sap any energy that Mann and Diaz give the film. Any time music kicks in, terrible filmmaking results, usually in montage form."
"A diverting but ultimately unsatisfying 75 minutes, simultaneously too short and too cluttered to meaningfully explore all the fascinating implications it presents."
Nothing more than a small-town gay love triangle with no antagonist and very little conflict.
This story is best left on the page.
"By the time a sympathetic doctor (the luminous Brnice Bejo) changes his life, the film has become tiresome."
"[Wilder] seems lo be unaware that realism without pity is not only ugly but also, in the long run, deadly dull."
"To be sure, first-time director Gary McKendry keeps things moving at an adrenalized pace, even through thickets of flashbacks. But this is precisely Killer Elite's major problem: motion at the expense of emotion."
The direction is stubbornly flat-footed.
"These characters are written with the broad strokes of caricature, yet they are neither funny nor, in the end, sympathetic."
John Schlesinger and the horror film should never have met
"The movie is confusing and boring... Faye Dunaway does a decent job, but is incapable of overcoming the weakness of the book and the script. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"It's tough for actors to be nuanced when the movie isn't, and these intriguingly jagged edges soon get smoothed out."
"The Family is a fish-out-of-water/buddy comedy/Mob flick. But most of all, it's a missed opportunity."
Sets out to reinvent the genre only to succumb to all of the same old formulas.
This is a picture pretty comfortable on the bottom of a video shelf with Welcome to Mooseport.
"Maleficent 2 needed to be high camp, but it just came off highly cheesy. There's good pieces into this puzzle but they don't all fit together. Also, how do you sideline the titular character in her own film?"
This is ersatz subversion for an audience secretly terrified of the real thing.
"The film is one of the most original of that time of the fifties, and at the same time one of the most laughable. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"""Machete will return in: Machete Kills!"" boomed the gritty voiceover dude at the end of Robert Rodriguez's 2010 Mexploitation parody. Three years later, we're reminded that it was a threat, not a promise."
"Though Lucas and Jacob are lovely actors, you are not likely to care whose toes end up wearing tags."
"It draws the narrowest bead on a target audience of any film in recent memory: Elementary school-age boys may well be delighted, but it offers not a scintilla of stimulation for anyone else."
"Fahrenheit 451 features strong performances and a dancing, flickering visual flare, but all that's not enough to cover up the clunkiness of the script and the strain of reconfiguring this always relevant... story."
"Occasionally explosive, but rarely coherent."
In a movie where the title refers to the choice between the protagonist living and dying it's really not a great sign that you may find yourself willing her to go.
"The verbal wit is fairly weak this time around, though as in the previous film there's an endless succession of three-second star cameos."
"Its characters act as if they're slogging through an 85-minute screen exercise, not engaging in anything remotely resembling real life."
"What's most offensive about Movie 43 isn't the scatological humor, but how shoddily the whole thing was put together."
"Without actively disliking any part of it, you wish you could be on your way a whole hour before it limps to a close."
"The rapport between characters feels insincere, the juvenile humor suffocates whatever '80s thrills could unfold, and all actors are fully at the mercy of their lines."
"How he lost his way is really never sufficiently explained, making the decision to cast Dreier as the central narrator of his own tale highly questionable."
"Bobcat Goldthwait has proven himself to be such an outside-the-box visionary, it's unfathomable that his fertile mind could produce something as pedestrian as Willow Creek."
"Tomei and Powley-whose winsome intelligence shines through a wobbly New Yawk accent-are the two star players here, and yet they are forced to orbit around all this vaguely Oedipal male rutting."
Riddled with blatant product placement. Blades of Glory is better. Ferrell can't save this one. Sacha adds little.
Young viewers might be disturbed by the sight of Ahmanet's mouldy body desperately searching for new blood. Everyone else will just be depressed by the sight of a studio and star desperately doing the same.
The only clear message is of aging men enjoying a nostalgia trip... and thumbing their noses at the younger gay men who missed the party.
"It's the stuff of Sunday night TV drama, for winding down with tea and cake. Very civilised."
A steaming compost heap of high-art pretense and half-cocked psychoanalysis.
...it's not your fault if you decide to stop in the middle of The Wrong Missy. It is indeed very generic and demonstrates bad comedic taste...
"Other than some war set pieces, fish-out-of-water montages, and an uplifting message about the human spirit, there’s not much going on. "
"Seventh Son wraps itself in a bland colored shroud of clichs, making you find reality much more interesting than fiction."
"Relies on too many formulas in telling a tale that's far too familiar in too many ways to make us care about the outcome. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sexual Content, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
[W]hat should be an old-school audience pleaser winds up being a much more complicated film that is often at odds with itself.
The great Young Adult Allowance Grab continues.
"There are chases and escapes, morals and messages, comedy and character... but when the fur stops flying, it still feels more frozen than fresh."
"A wealth of familiar storybook material and a cast including Angelina Jolie and David Oyelowo will draw attention, but a handsome production and beautiful cast aren't enough to get this fantasy off the ground."
"Every time you think Hardwicke is about to focus on the story, here comes another skateboarding scene. After the 5th one, I got it. They were good. Whoopee."
"Despite its artistic gambles and the intellectual arguments it's sure to generate, I'm Not There doesn't even have the power of a vacuum. It's all there on the surface."
One can only hope that this isn't the best that Brazil has to offer cinematically.
"A wearying spectacle of unpleasant crunching sound effects (enough to put us off soft shell crabs for years), bad editing, hideous cinematography and spectacularly confused plotting."
Stripped of all the ingenuity and observations that made the original story worthwhile.
"Mostly the film is guilty of stinting on action and suspense, which makes ""Stillwater"" a little too aptly titled."
I&apos;m not a Michael Myers fan&#44; but even I&apos;m offended at the disrespect towards the character&#46; Worst by far out of this new trilogy&#46; 
"hat sounds like a stirring story of resilience turns out to be a rather plodding movie, which falls back on clichd flashbacks to augment Hartnett's solo privations."
The comedy is disposable because Ferrell and Heder don't bother being recognizably human.
"You can't help but shake the feeling that you were having more fun with the old, sarcastic, lying Will."
"I would love to support a ""dumbed down"" version of classic fiction that might get young viewers doing something that seems increasingly uncommon - cracking a book. But does it have to be this far down? And this dumb?"
"The History Boys is essentially filmed theater, with minimal, and usually clumsy, attempts to take the action out of the classroom."
...off-putting in a garish way.
Indy filmmaker Ingrid Veninger strives earnestly to create an iconic Canadian coming-of-age story. It isn't entirely successful.
Stevenson spends so much time on nuances that he doesn't quite develop the characters or move the plot along until late into the movie.
"More useless than bad, the type of thing that will divert your attention for an hour and a half but nothing more."
"Isn't all that different from any number of old Adam Sandler pictures. That's to say that it's not very good, and you probably won't find it terribly funny."
"Surprisingly, hell turns out to be not very interesting when seen close up, and ""Climax"" is a bad trip that crashes before its characters do."
A major letdown.
While the scenes from Sam's past accurately and melodiously depict the tenderness of first love...the modern story seems dreary and dry by comparison.
"Ill-conceived and clumsily executed, this is the sort of film that coasts on the names involved and is too indifferent to care if audiences actually like it."
What it accomplishes with its stunning cinematography and set design is undercut by a lack of coherence.
"Albert Lewin produced, wrote, and directed -- astonishingly, he managed to work again after this."
"An impressively staged climactic exorcism compensates in part for the random, far-fetched storytelling that precedes it."
"Even in this less-than-magic kingdom, Reese rules."
"All it does is make you wish [Robin Williams] never discovered movies -- or, at least, stuck to voicing cartoons and doing the odd, occasional drama."
It's hard to avoid an acute case of gag reflex sitting through a feature film's worth of ponderous pomp that amounts to little more than one long TV commercial for itself.
Why?
"A lot of modern horror has become more synonymous with horrifying rather than terrifying, the chief difference being the latter also provokes feelings of psychological unease."
"Instead of giving you the book, it leaves you with the unfulfilled sense of having leafed through an elegant, studiously captioned photo essay of the same material."
"The heralded ""violent"" scene practically screams ""We need domestic distribution!"" I don't think anyone in this movie actually likes this movie."
...a long way from Harold and Kumar...
Generation X-ers continue to feel superior about their teen films...adding intelligence & darkness can make a generic teen romp into a rewatchable touchstone. Not Sleepover.
"Perhaps, if this movie fails, studios will finally accept that we all deserve better."
I wanted to cast a few spells myself on the writers...evil spells.
"There's no denying that audiences will enjoy Sims' film, laughing and crying at the exact moments it wants them to, but Sims having his heart in the right place can't entirely mask the mawkish and cheesy nature of the story."
You wind up feeling like you've participated in a self-help exercise with super-high production values.
"Now You See Me 2 is a slightly beefier, funnier movie than its predecessor that still fails to learn from any of the original's mistakes and manages to make some new ones along the way."
"The film is a dog. It's tepid and clumsy, and entirely derivative."
"Cats is a strange beast to begin with, but the combination of strange CGI makes the translation from stage to screen even worse."
As uninspired and flat as a lot of the CGI action movies that are produced right here in the United States.
A valiant but losing effort.
However the makers of Flash of Genius faced a problem they couldn't quite solve: This is a story about windshield wipers.
"You can envision a really interesting version of The Call. This, regrettably, is not that version."
"Molly's Game is so thoroughly worked out that its drama never gets going, because neither its characters nor you have any chance to take a breath."
Megan Fox steals the show while Bruce Willis is missing in action.
The movie is frequently adorable. But it's liable to create more than a few existential crises in viewers entirely unprepared to handle them.
[The Coen brothers have] made a broad comedy out of a black comedy and completely lost its charm in the process.
"Granted, this is hardly Wicker Man 2: NOT THE BEES!, but LaBute should be counted on for a movie with more teeth than what Lakeview Terrace is prepared to offer"
"Stuber has a couple of solid laughs thanks to its two talented leads, but the rest is mostly stale and uninteresting."
Patsy Cline. Loretta Lynn. Gwyneth Paltrow.
"Rather than elevating this wanna-be Hammer horror flick, Cage somehow lowers its quality."
When will Hollywood learn that successful animated concepts just don't cut it when translated to flesh-and blood life?
It makes for one insufferably soppy Valentine.
The superior craftsmanship helps to sustain the film until the horrific violence makes it literally unwatchable.
"Dirty, angry, and it feels like it wants to pick a fight with you."
I admire Disney for trying to do something different -- they didn't just make a shot-for-shot remake of the original movie -- but all of the choices they made were inferior to the original film.
Parental Content Review
It's performed with such consummate precision and showmanship that at times you would swear you were watching something with a heart.
"Shortchanges the courtroom scenes, where the sparks would really fly in a pluckier script..."
Far too much of this handsomely mounted adventure is devoted to routinely dramatized adolescent minutiae.
A searing performance by Brian Cox gets doused by a bucket of shameless moralizing too tepid for TV.
"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a Mormon family movie, and a sappy, preachy one at that."
"We live in ridiculous, often scary times, and political satire can provide a valuable tonic and perspective. But filmmakers have to make the effort."
One late sequence ends with a twist that steers the film into a questionable bit of plotting that seems almost entirely at odds with the believable naturalism of the remainder of the movie.
"Amid an overbearing story that suffocates its humor, Chicks' increasingly repetitive and tired jokes reek of a comedy on autopilot."
"if there's one instance of the road to perdition paved with fat budgets and good intentions, it's Defiance, or, as I prefer to call it, Custersky's Last Stand in Belarus."
The general gorgeousness of [The Cheetah Girls:] One World almost but not quite distracts from what has become a tedious and increasingly disturbing narrative conflict.
"The biggest disappointment, honestly, is that Proud Mary never really does anything with the 70s vibe the poster and the title sequence promise"
It's hard to imagine whom the filmmakers had in mind for this lavish production.
This live-action re-imagining of Disney's 1941 animated classic may be the sweetest film Tim Burton has ever made. It's also the safest.
"Perhaps if Farrell and Rapace and Oplev had all stayed in Europe - and tried to do a similar script, with half-as-much firepower, and twice as much brainpower - they might have had something worth watching. Instead it's just something worth ducking."
I think Gunner Palace was in some sense a fairer film.
Another Liam Neeson clunker thats far from memorable. 
"Come for the atmosphere, but don't stay for the plot"
Zombie fails to fully wrestle to the ground any of the movie's themes in an engaging or meaningful way... so its swan-dive into arbitrariness from the second act on is fairly complete.
"amazing imagery, moody score, ludicrous science, mentally challenged dialogue and eyeball-scratching acting"
"I don't mean to say that this is a garbage film, but it's not a good film. It's a lazy, sloppy, presumptuous movie that shows no respect whatsoever for fans."
...nary a drop formed in my lachrymal glands...
"Some Body often looks like an episode of the TV show Blind Date, only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments."
"All of this is a decidedly one-note affair, but to be fair, Larraín plays that note with such confidence that there's at least some stylistic nuance to it."
This is just a predictable bland movie with a lot of music kids won't have heard of.
Travers hated what Disney did to her creation&#44; and she would have hated what his studio has now done to her&#46;
"The jokes fizzle, the action sequences underwhelm ... is this the end of the line?"
"It won best-picture Oscar for 1952, but God (De Mille's favorite walk-on, strangely absent here) only knows why."
Missing is the narrative and emotional cohesiveness that would likely have led to [Phantom Boy] being [more] engaging and memorable.
Subtlety and sincerity go out the window in favour of crass stereotypes and easy jibes ...
It's porn for pagans; the kind of movie that will play well at The Corn Exchange.
"He's Just Not That Into You wishes it were Love, Actually crossed with The Break-Up, but it plays more like a horror movie for the WASP set."
"I would like to take this occasion to lodge a complaint. There is no valid reason, none in the observable universe, why mainstream romantic comedies must adhere to the same script."
This handsome and luxuriant biopic of the French fashion maestro is all surface and no feeling.
"Quirky for quirky's sake, making it absurd and insulting."
One can only assume that 'the blind leading the blind' best describes the decision to adapt this novel in such an abysmal manner.
"In the end, The Turning just drifts."
You keep waiting for The King's Man to find its footing.
"Mostly it just reminds us anew how difficult it is to make convincing entertainment on a grandiose scale, especially when all involved are taking themselves so terribly seriously."
"There's a countdown and two days before Christmas I was ready to go home and start peeling sprouts. Hahn is fabulous; Sarandon's Grandma Isis a hoot. But the movie isn't funny enough. Written and directed by men, I don't think they realise how bad we are."
"It would appear that in addition to robbing his brood of their need for blood, Carlisle also removed their balls."
"Every beat of the picture has the ring of pushy inauthenticity, and despite all the outre eccentricities, a plodding lack of uniqueness."
"I am giving Gigli one star and that is only because of Walken: if Brest were smart, when the film hits DVD, he should only release that scene and stick the rest in the deleted scenes section."
"Provocative in design, clumsy in execution."
"Director Harold Ramis had more serious ambitions. Multiplicity should have been another Groundhog Day, which Ramis also directed, but he comes up short."
A bunch of nasty kill scenes in search of a plot (and scares).
"While Head Games does feature a number of articulate and consistently intelligent talking-head interviews, it's ultimately not a satisfying advocacy doc."
"The unspoken message seems to be that we're lucky that Hogancamp was brutalized and nearly died because, as a result, he's now making imaginative art."
"1980s B-movie studio Cannon Films + gun-toting, gator-wrestling man's man Chuck Norris = a recipe for unapologetic action-movie cheese."
Even entering Plane with modest expectations&#44; director Jean-Fran&#231;ois Richet&#8217;s film fails to connect and winds up being as much fun as going through a TSA checkpoint&#46; 
"Straddled uncomfortably between the mythic and the particular until what started out as exhilarating becomes exhausting, it's a road movie that winds up driving in circles."
Have you heard of the Academy Awards? Spot's movie will not be receiving one.
"Its visuals are executed skillfully, it takes time to develop characters, and its voice cast has personality. But in today's context of broadened animation appeals, Atlantis seems as stale as uncirculated submarine air."
"It's not a bad concept, but it's poorly executed. What could have been a poignant story ends up being sappier than a maple tree in March."
"Despite some visual sparkle and musical razzle-dazzle, Idlewild is a messy movie."
"It's a futile pseudo-literary move, like watching someone try to turn skim milk into heavy cream."
It's just too bad that the pious treatment given the deserving Pimentel never translated into a more engaging film.
Ratner isn't a capable enough director to work the alchemy needed to make this cheese into gold.
"Peter Hyams's lurid, FX-happy thriller slams pieces of a dozen other movies into a noxious new compound. It has to be seen to be believed, but who'd want to?"
"Given the man himself is so interesting, it's frustrating that his portrayal is so bland."
"Shortchanges the courtroom scenes, where the sparks would really fly in a pluckier script..."
Formulaic thriller. At least the fight sequences are cool.
Cronicas is two thirds of a really good movie - someone let me know when they find the rest.
"A Western for teens who've never seen one, made by people who've only ever seen Young Guns."
"You say you've seen it all before? Sure, but perhaps not so foolishly put together as in ''Prettykill.''"
It plays like a by-the-numbers action flick that happens to have a few funny lines in it. It is barely watchable.
"The fact that this was considered a ""hit"" boggles my mind. I did not enjoy this. The 80's was a wild time. "
"The first movie based on an SNL sketch that neglects to incorporate the essential elements of that sketch-which are, after all, the only reason for the picture's existence."
"The narcissism is evident in every gesture he makes, in every line he delivers. Like the movie itself, whose contradictions conceal a fairly simple agenda for this stability-hungry era, Brad Pitt tries to present himself here as a model of masculinity."
"This supernatural spellbinder succeeds at disorienting the viewer with a cleverly structured screenplay, but it never quite manages to frighten despite some solid tension and eerie imagery."
For Meg Ryan this was opportunity to shed her image of romantic comedies queen and play some serious role for a change.
Kelly stretches a perfectly good 22-minute television episode out to two hours with an insane barrage of red herrings and metaphysical sci-fi mumbo-jumbo
"It suffers from a real lack of charisma, still the dance bits are good."
"Everyone here — the actors, the audience, the genre — deserves better. "
The film's abundant visual splendor can't compensate for a clichéd screenplay that makes it difficult to invest much rooting interest in the characters.
"Life on the Road, alas, is a slog too far down memory lane."
"ETERNALS undoubtedly [expands] the universe of possible stories [as] the series looks to move into a new era. However, the conflicting approaches felt here reveal that this range of films isn't ready or willing to expand how it tells those stories."
The solemnity of Josef Kubota Wladykas film is at odds with the gratuitousness of its violence.
"The film goes badly awry, I think. There is something coy and miscalculated about it all. Mouret is quite talented as an actor, but maybe it's time he found another writer."
Deck the Halls strains to be both naughty and nice with much clamor and not much conviction.
To call it ludicrous would be to give it far too much credit.
It's going back to the franchise's long-running tradition of producing subsequent Halloween movies so painfully inferior that you can feel not just your fandom but your very lifeforce being drained.
"Unfortunately, the film is often stately and sluggish with some very daytime-soapy moments of emotional revelation."
"You realize the characters easily could have gone all Yoda and said something like 'With fire you play, burned you will be' and still got the point across with a far greater economy of words. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)"
For Spielberg to take on a downer of a story like A.I. is like Santa Claus taking charge of the IRS.
"Post Elizabeth, Cate Blanchett was trying to subvert expectations and to do something completely different. So she chose this gothic thriller from a director who is known for horror movies."
There are some solid chuckles in the lowbrow crime comedy Live Free or Die but they're not enough to sustain its slight story for a whole 90 minutes.
"Despite the best efforts of all concerned, what seemed explosive and provocative two decades ago now comes across as schematic and artificial."
"Once a year, St. Petersburg is awash with thoughtless, unpleasant people making poor decisions. This spring, Korine is one of them."
"Basically, it's The A-Team meets Rambo meets Mission: Impossible, with a mission that's one part trickiness, four parts blowing stuff up."
Morbius's greatest legacy might be that it united the internet to dunk on a movie nobody asked for.
"Sap, sentiment, and hokey plot devices bog down an otherwise down to earth story."
Flatly ignores any kind of joy-of-filmmaking themes and instead takes the standard coming-of-age route.
"Man of the Year is only Comedy of the Year for about 45 minutes. Then, it becomes Failed Opportunity of the Year."
"A charmless, witless, lumbering mess. Almost nothing could redeem this lame comedy."
"As in bad plays, everyone always means exactly what he says and never has to think a second before saying it. There is no feeling for the complexity of the mental processes, for the mysterious ways in which the mind works."
"As a professional preacher, I could appreciate (the film) to some degree as a satiric take on storytelling in both religious and secular circles. Sorry to say, that's about as far as my appreciation goes."
"The filmmakers' command of the form extends to intentionally dopey performances and a total rejection of plot, all of which gets tiresome."
"A hot mess whose sub-par direction mostly neutralizes its fantastic comedic premise. High School is a willfully 'stupid' stoner comedy, yes, but it also illustrates the gap between stupid done right and merely indulged too far."
"When Kevin Spacey's thinks-he's-a-spaceman mental patient tells his psychiatrist, 'For an educated person, Mark, you repeat things quite a bit,' he essentially summarizes the strengths and weaknesses of the movie K-PAX."
"Unintentionally funny and then just plain sad, Lucy in the Sky is one of the most disappointing films of 2019."
At the mercy of material so fussy that no amount of frenetically-chopped vegetables can lend the piece much in the way of tension.
Yet another sleeper hit becomes a cynical franchise. I guess 'Nappy-Cutz' wins after all.
"The movie isn't poorly made, but writer/co-director Pascal Arnold has left out the interesting bits."
"There's an extended sequence of underwater kissing that makes it seem that both Page and Pigg are mer-people. Seriously, they never come up for air as they make out in about 15 different positions. It's only the audience that's drowning."
It constantly fascinated me -- albeit not always in a good way. What it did not do is make me laugh.
"A gargantuan mess of a film, which substitutes special effects for story and has not a single redeeming moment in its two hour plus running time."
Predictable and not terribly clever.
"No, it's not the worst film ever made, but it is a sickening exercise in smugness and self-love."
This insultingly dumb film doesn't even have the good manners to be fun.
The humor is forced and the absurdist elements overwhelm the realism.
"Director Florent Emilio Siri is so caught up in his florid stylings that ""Hostage"" is somewhat enjoyable on a cheesy level"
"Apologists may wish to compare this style of filmmaking to Michelangelo Antonioni, but who really wants to endure The Turkish L'Avventura?"
A campy Van Damne actioner fit for lovers of B films.
"The spiciest entry in the series, it boasts the most T&A, an incredible double homicide, a witty reference to A Place in the Sun, and yokels chopping chickens."
Harder to sit through than Battlefield Earth.
"While ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is much better than most third entries, it's still flabby and convoluted."
Unintentionally hilarious.
"If 'Half-assing your career will get you nowhere' counts as a big lesson for young artists, the music industry is in even bigger trouble than we thought."
"Uma experiência consideravelmente melhor do que o original %u2013 o que, na prática, é o mesmo que dizer que é ""melhor"" ser abocanhado por um leão faminto do que por dois."
This uneventful installment basically treads water while functioning as a setup for the upcoming dramatic conclusion
The film is infuriating.
"Baz Lurhman never sets a consistent tone for movie. There's too much camp for the film to be taken as a serious drama, and the filmmaker flirts with outdated '30s era cinema conventions of a John Ford western like ""Stagecoach."""
"Even as the movie takes a slight turn into surrealism in its final third, and becomes more overtly political as it steams towards its ending, the sum is slight and obscure."
"Russell Gewirtz's script is built around a trick, one that is simultaneously too clever by half and not clever at all (which itself is quite a trick)."
What starts out as a promisingly deadpan supernatural drama quickly devolves into The Exorcism of Charlie Rose
The adjective in the title is right. It gets old pretty quickly.
"As an action director, Mr. Cohen is competent, but this film -- which is pretty much as non-stop as an action movie can get -- needed a director with a little more finesse."
"Documenting the way we speak now, however, doesn't compensate for the film's own hollow rhetoric; TGE's tricked-out, fractured narrative merely distracts from its dead-end cynicism."
Jia's plot itself can look like a series of arbitrary choices whose only purpose is to convey the director's allegorical intentions.
"It's an improvement over the last two films, but really...a good solid blow to the head would have been an improvement over the last two films."
It all looks phony and sounds artificial from side to side.
"There are some nice touches, and the bustle of Mumbai is always fascinating, and the performances are good all-round, but whatever Batra hoped this would add up to it doesn't."
There&#8217;s no glitz or glamour to set it apart from the pack&#44; and that&#8217;s ultimately &#91;The Invitation&apos;s&#93; demise&#46;
"By the time you get to the saccharine finale, it's turned into The X Factor, but with kilts."
&#46;&#46;&#46;a frustrating and completely lackluster mystery that feels so much longer than its endless 139 minutes&#46;
"A largely dull music industry saga, more TV movie than vibrant celebration of American youth culture."
"As in Destin Daniel Cretton's previous feature, Short Term 12, the oscillations between sociological horror and misty-eyed sentimentality call attention to how meticulously the film arranges its emotional punches."
The film's unwillingness to engage in any meaningful sense with the issues it purports to raise feels like an opportunity squandered.
"It was a bummer of a movie, and I do like these kinds of movies."
"Considering the wealth of writings by Isak Dinesen and others that its makers had to draw on, this lumbering, $30-million prestige picture is astonishingly glossy, distressingly conventional, and grossly overlong."
"It's time to face the facts that, by and large, Shyamalan is not a good filmmaker. He certainly has some interesting ideas, but his impulse to keep things secretive instead of playing a story straight does not serve those ideas well."
I think at this point somebody needs to tell Robin Williams that the whole white-guy hip-hop routine was played out around 1997.
"An utterly gorgeous visual delight, and it has some enjoyably goofy moments, managing to throw in some left-leaning, anti-elitism socio-economic subtext for good measure."
A series of flashy scenes that work on their own histrionic terms but add up to nothing you can't predict in the first five minutes.
"In the end it devolves into something disappointingly ordinary, which, given the proven skills and sensibilities of director Marc Forster ..."
"Lady Macbeth eventually turns into a meaningless, mean-spirited, and proudly irredeemable non-character study."
Hooper brings an appropriate sense of grandness to the musical &#91;&#46;&#46;&#46;&#93; but overall&#44; the creative choices call more attention to how it was made and distract from the powerful story&#46;
An ambitious failure.
I liked the movie without loving it.
"This Truth lies somewhere between a gauzy, '50s Hollywood movie and a noirish erotic thriller -- neither which are done all that well."
The Infiltrator introduces a dizzying ensemble of characters into its overstretched duration to weave a tale we already know too well.
They're dull though animated/ Macabre but PG-rated/ And sad to say I hated/ The Addams Family!
Wonder Park takes its inspiration from early childhood craft sessions and the storytelling feels about as sophisticated.
"If you've made a movie in which former TV star Lee Majors ... is the funniest person present, then you have surely made a movie that sucks a lot."
"Starting with the opening scene where Moreno is planning her own annual themed birthday party, it doesn't take long to figure out the film is going to be more of a vanity project than a warts-and-all objective analysis."
"Even without the stir ignited by casting Mel Gibson and Emile Hirsch, both with assault charges on their records, as white cops battling ""Rican"" villains during Hurricane Maria, this downpour of cliches and ethnic stereotyping is a total washout."
I can imagine baffled Boomers tuning into Without Remorse and contemplating legal action.
"Instead of quitting while he's way ahead, Costner takes on For Love of the Game, a melodramatic film version of Michael Shaara's novel."
"Less a thriller than an experiment in confusion, trying to rile up the audience by stranding them in scenes they don't understand, over and over until the climax mercifully sets us free."
"You can take what happens in Vegas, keep it in Vegas, and keep the rest of the us out of it."
"The expected misunderstandings ensue, as you'd expect, which would be pretty excruciating if not for the performances of Hoffman and Streisand."
"Made In America is an all-too-accurate reflection of the safe, boring, middle-aged politician Jay-Z has become."
Needlessly corny...a manipulative melodrama that wastes the presence of a fine actress such as Bates...Furlong's brooding becomes rather tedious in Bill's drowsy dud
There's more beer product placement than memorable jokes.
Suffers from a lack of conviction.
"The actors are far too good for the silly script; plot rabbits are pulled from its hat with absurd ease, and harbor seals drop in as shamelessly applied local color."
"Despite the numbing number of motivational speeches set against the swelling strains of martial music, [director] Lin's film has little to do with military life. It is instead a mundane boxing movie."
... I wish the writing had been sharper
An appalling piece of junk.
I can't say for sure that all productions of Cats are bad (although I have a hunch) but I can certainly say that this one is.
"One can't fault Wesley Snipes for dragging his aging body for a third installment of the financially successful ""Blade"" series...**"
Wasn't nearly as horrible as I thought it would be.
I'd be lying if I didn't admit to giggling madly through the majority of this bit of B-grade hokum.
"There's real ambiguity in the Oher case, but writer-director John Lee Hancock papers over it; it's possible to see the Tuohys as generous, caring people without brushing off their less-altruistic reasons for sponsoring Oher."
"A lot of crotches get abused in the kiddie comedy Unaccompanied Minors. And as a viewer, I felt a lot like a crotch."
Everything is relentlessly grim and dour without earning the weight to make that mean something.
Kangaroo Jack falls flat more than it bounces.
Whatevs.
Another mediocre comedy from Chris Rock.
Director Ridley Scott delivers a passable spy movie that has nothing to say about this region; he may as well have been directing from a monitor in his hotel suite.
"A horrible ""new beginning"". Paramount got greedy and this came out in theaters. [Full review in Spanish]."
Unfortunately Blaustein isn't an experienced enough film-maker to make much of such material.
"Timing is everything in comedy, and this one has no idea where it's going half the time."
"I think the film disserves what Redford, at his best, can be as an actor in favor of a fraudulent, senior citizen variation on glossy movie-star iconography."
Earthling to Echo. No kid on any planet is going to like this one.
"I would rather more Kaiser, less lovey-dovey, and a better imagining of the man's last days."
"The movie plays safe by cutting every theme down the middle - a swing that's effective when splitting wood or vampire skulls, but dull when applied to filmmaking."
"Features lively performances - I'm looking at you Oldman and Banderas - timely commentary about whistleblowers and fraud and a rousing fourth wall breaking ending and yet, feels like less than the sum of its parts."
"The film is so clumsy and so off the mark that it winds up being a throwaway piece, something for Universal Monster completists only."
"The director, Shawn Levy, and the writers, Mr. Vaughn and Jared Stern, have dreamed up a feel-good comedy that plays like a demo reel of dj views."
"It's a film jam-packed with very good actors and big names, and suffused with a puppyish willingness to please. But where is the bite?"
"Everything about these two is just too calculatedly precious, it's like watching two ten year-olds fall in love."
"The result is a tale that drags outside of its admittedly impressive, but same-y set-pieces, that appears to have had more time spent on prosthetics than plot and, criminally, doesn't bring Tem back until an hour in."
Darren Lynn Bousman also has to resort to cheap tactics such as constant hallucinations to generate any kind of suspense or intrigue beyond the premise; it all fizzles out right after the set-up is established
"Loyal fans should find the conclusion of the Resident Evil series satisfactory, but audiences yet to be won over won't find anything new to sway them now."
"Ashley Bell is still the best thing about the franchise but even she can't rescue this one. No ""Part 3"" please!"
"It's one thing for a romantic comedy to be predictable -- they all end at the same destination, after all. But it's quite another thing to be predictable at every twist and turn of the story."
"The Sentinel runs through its contrived and prescribed paces efficiently enough, but with minimal real tension or the kind of character involvement that really makes you invest in its outcome."
Ms. Brownson hasn't figured out how to construct a movie around a figure who essentially owes her fame to the obfuscation of her past.
Tali Sharon gives a strong performance in a very demanding role. Let's hope she appears next in a film with a more interesting script.
"Clearly Twohy intended Riddick to be a big, flashy, comic-book affair, but the lure of Franchise Filmmaking seems to have dulled his genre-loving sensibilties."
"[S]tilted, forced, phony, emotionally implausible, and - contrary to all apparent hopes for itself - rather paternalistic and patronizing."
"The movie is clearly aimed at kids, but is this really the kind of stuff we should be filling their brains with?"
"Ariel Kleiman fashions an erotic atmosphere of dusty sensuality that complicates our judgement of this world, but he takes shortcuts."
It takes a promising idea and mostly surrounds it with dull characters and insipid scenarios&#46;
Blake Edwards misfire has stellar cast
Good for the fans but probably only so-so for everyone else.
Only Stephen Hawkings could understand the plot of T-G. It's great to see the Arnold of PUMPING IRON resurrected by CGI. Why couldn't that Arnold be in the whole movie?
Willard has some terrifying moments but it never comes up to being a'Psycho with rats that it sometimes aspires to. In between the horror scenes matters develop with little suspense or even mood.
"Mixes, not quite successfully, traditional Bollywood storytelling with something less conventional."
The comic highlight is when Heigl wears a pair of vibrating pants to a business dinner.
"A dog's breakfast of clashing ideas and concepts; it's confused and confusing, and the more it tries to untangle itself, the deeper it digs itself into an incoherent hole."
"By no means is this a good movie, but it's warmed by the solar energy of its star, who surely deserves better than this formula empowerment flick."
"I Love You, Man makes sure to give audiences exactly what they're expecting, but I couldn't shake the sense that the whole thing felt compulsory."
A lazy and not very funny stoner comedy.
Is the golden age of Judd Apatow already waning?
"Fatboy may be more welcome than the latest Matthew McConaughey-Kate Hudson vehicle, but only by a nose."
"In the end, its lack of originality and extremely low sense of humor keep Soul Men down a lot further than it deserves. There's potential there, but it's never realized."
Can we declare a moratorium on stringy-haired ghost women who make freaky noises?
"It's an ugly, laughless 3-D cartoon about wolves that is so wussified and stupidified that it'll bore kids and make their adult minders wish they'd done something comparatively interesting, like cleaning the gutters in the rain."
Despite a strong central performance &#46;&#46;&#46; there&apos;s simply not much more than predictable formula in My Donkey&#44; My Lover &amp; I&#46;
"I am overwhelmed by the intensity of theme, and underwhelmed by the sophomoric content thereof, and so I end up in the middle, sort of whelm-neutral."
"""No Escape"" plays like an ""Argo"" rewrite by someone who heard about ""Argo"" from a friend who never saw ""Argo."""
"There's only a vague message about bootstraps and personal responsibility, and a whole lot of bad wigs."
"For me, Black Bear is more of a bugbear."
"With a leaner, more focused and thrilling plot, it could've been as entertaining as one of the many B-movies that The Cannon Group used to release back in the 80's. Instead, it's a dull, lethargic, meandering bore that wastes its talented cast."
"It is so silly, so convoluted in terms of plot, but so insouciant that it almost gets away with it. Almost."
Watching this movie is like being wired to a TV set on permanent channel-surf mode!
The two halves&#44; though cleverly explained in the final frames&#44; clash more than connect&#46; Both have similar toxic underpinning&#44; but only one grabbed my attention and left me feeling something&#46;
"Not nearly as enthralling as the original, the director lazily copies and pastes..."
"Despite its pretensions, The 9th Life of Louis Drax is not hard to figure out, and no amount of beautifully lit dream imagery makes up for a recycled whodunit."
Happy Death Day 2U is a messy film that repeats itself over and over again without actually going anywhere.
"Nothing feels invested in long enough to register because the narrative is constantly jumping around, almost as if it's scared there's not enough story here to carry a film."
Satan looks pretty dang cool; the rest of the movie looks crummier -- and is less amusing -- than a 1970s Crown-International drive-in picture.
Beneath all the pizzazz the movie is nothing more than another retelling of the chestnut about the hapless travelers who fall into the clutches of a family of backwoods oddballs with malevolent purposes in mind.
World's Greatest Dad crushes a boldly funny concept with inert and bloodless filmmaking.
The Visitor is doppelg&#228;nger horror in more ways than one&#46; Audiences have seen it all before&#46;
"No one asked for Mary Poppins's return to modern consciousness, but her reappearance unmistakably proves that Hollywood Boomers are desperate to justify their own mediocrity through nostalgic sentiment."
The young female viewers of The Space Between Us deserve better than stories where their entire identities are obliterated by guys who are so blandly nice that they fall into bed.
"A sheer slog to sit through, Fireflies In The Garden might have worked if it wasn't so damn po-faced and the script actually had something to say about how families work."
"A few dollars lighter, a few hours closer to death, get a chance to glimpse your own mortality reflected in the dead, shark-eyed glare of another big-budget prestige picture."
"Promising pedigree aside, this nonsensical romance's a laborious entertainment."
"Rust and Bone, Audiard's latest study in physical weathering and emotional repression, only further confirms his ongoing obsession with surfaces."
"Grizzly II is a dreadful experience, but it's an oddly fascinating one as well, in that, not only does it exist in general, but it's somehow being released in theaters in 2021."
Most unconvincing!
"A Dead Film Walking, a zombie of a film, a shuffling Frankenstein's monster of a film, leaking electricity from its badly-fitting neck bolts, tragically whimpering at the pointless agony of its own brief existence."
[It] might be a bottomless barrel of idiotic yuks. But it's not a total lemon.
What really seems to be missing here is the maturity to create continuity within the fantasy -- something even Saturday cartoons try to do.
"Once a muckraker, Paine now acts mostly as a cheerleader, and his slick new movie trades heavily in the sort of flattering CEO profiles that grace the covers of business magazines."
It is difficult to care about a couple when both parties are deeply unpleasant.
Superficial dysfunctional story on the rich.
"Two actors I really love fall prey to Hollywood's 'make a movie with an overused tired formula' machine. Sadly, a non-delivering train wreck without much humor."
"Ingenious with a fine performance by Emily Blunt, but far too much cold-blooded violence."
Even the soft-hearted may find this formulaic yarn of a young man's apprenticeship to a cantankerous artist too rosy-hued and treacly.
"At two and a half hours, Sex 2 -- like its predecessor -- is a long sit in the shallows, the equivalent of five half-hour episodes strung together."
"If you can delight in the delight of others, you just may delight in this. Otherwise, prepare to be awfully jealous, because it's the sort of picture where the actors are having a lot more fun than the audience."
"The worst of this new Lady and the Tramp comes when the script piles on the strenuous comic action, followed by ill-advised dark shadows."
"The stock dismissal ""more of the same"" has rarely been more accurately applied to a sequel than to The Hangover Part II, which ranks as little more than a faded copy of its predecessor superimposed on a more brightly colored background."
"This predictable flick executed in a numbingly pedestrian fashion, has slapped a nifty conceit onto its threadbare mystery-thriller plot, but has somehow managed to miss every opportunity to take advantage of it"
"Accidental Love appears to have hints of David O. Russell's original social commentary, but the film wastes its potential on annoying slapstick set pieces."
"The ""sick lit"" genre gets a crushingly bad new addition...spectacularly uninspired stuff."
"Ultimately, it fails across the board."
"The film is really much ado about very little because it takes no stand and gives little insight into the Chopper's psyche , all while too carefully catering to his machinated media image."
"I came away from this film unsure of what it was trying to say, unsure of how to classify it, and definitely unhappy with the ending."
Viewers old enough to understand even rudimentary narratives deserve better than a handful of scattered laughs and a great deal of visual unpleasantness&#46;
Is it an inside joke that a movie named I.T. is so jaw-droppingly dumb?
"At its best, it's Black Hawk Down with more heart. At its worst, it's Rambo- meets-John Ford."
Even these old pros ... fail to lift a leaden balloon of a movie.
It&#8217;s completely inoffensive but also lacking emotional heft&#44; a result of sloppy story structure and flashback-heavy plotting&#46;
"A group of benevolent, joyful creatures willingly dedicate their lives to serving the worst forms of life on the planet: that is a terrible concept for a comedy."
"Good dumb fun can be lowbrow without being lazy, but bite-sized episodes of creative lunacy are not enough to qualify Anchorman as the kind of dumb worth paying to see."
"Clearly the target audience is in on the joke here, but the film often feels smug and cynical rather than illuminating or insightful."
"The monumental hand-wringing about Kennedy feels, the further we get away from the event, somehow inappropriate."
"A small, cramped film about an aimless woman in her mid-20s who becomes involved with an innocent prep school student."
Pawlikowski is compelling his two lovers on a sadistic and slightly contrived trajectory to end-gain the moral of the story which is that corrosive politics destroy lives.
"It's a formula job all the way, filled with pratfalls, flying food, much male incompetence in the face of child-rearing realities, and a cast of violence-prone children on sugar highs who somehow turn into angels by the film's last sappy moments."
"Most of the time, it's knowingly stupid, which makes watching it 90 minutes of occasional fun and frequent indifference."
"The script for this comedy is so half-baked that we begin to wonder why it was made at all. Not only is it resolutely unfunny, but it never dips beneath a superficial examination of relationship cliches."
"... too tortured, too inconsistent, to offer a cohesive experience, much less an enjoyable one."
A strong first half gives way to genre predictability.
"Despite Banderas' charm and convincing performances from Rob Brown and Yaya DaCosta as his most difficult trainees, the dramatic portions of 'Lead' are as corny as the Hammer Dance."
"The director's hokey melodrama and derivative action, when coupled with his inability to create any synergy between form and content, ultimately turns Typhoon into an insipid drag."
"Cavill is no substitute for Van Damme, whose self-critical performance gave the earlier movie much of its heft"
"The central question that ""Avatar"" poses, however, is whether expensively advanced filmmaking technology is enough in itself to carry a whole film. "
"While production values in 'Bangkok Dangerous' are competent, there are no technical fireworks to compensate for the story's dearth of energy and originality."
"Russell ... stitches together a series of stunt sequences, giving as little time as possible to dialogue and character development."
"The film's strongest suit is its elegant photography and confident mounting, but these virtues do little to offset the script's pervasive weaknesses."
"His wife doesn't love him, his son's scared by him and he seems to be on better social terms with his enemies than his friends. Then again, we can't quite blame them. We don't like the guy either."
The Alamo isn't so much Hollywood cheese as it is a big bowl of weak queso that could've used a couple handfuls of jalapeos.
"The elaborate new Cenobite designs owe as much to Guillermo del Toro’s bioclockwork as Barker’s S&M body mods, but yet again the emissaries of Hell stand around being philosophically evil rather than doing much of anything."
"Except maybe for dance fans, it's unclear what, exactly, viewers are supposed to make of this portrait of a deeply unpleasant man whose talent is more spoken of than displayed."
"Like Shrek, A Knight's Tale takes its soundtrack from pop songs of today, but, not at all like Shrek, A Knight's Tale is insulting, boring, and sad."
"I Am Greta fails to provide a rounded view, so we don't get the full story behind such a prominent individual."
Short on laugh-out-loud comedy beats - while also failing to find the 'heart' that made similar genre farces like Blazing Saddles timeless comedy classics.
"All the CGI-assisted, 3-D sparkle is a wonder to behold, and for a short time it effectively distracts from the inert drama underneath."
Makes a proud point of its unpleasantness.
"Spectacle works for only so long. As its surface allure wanes, the movie becomes as tiresomely superficial as its subjects."
"a leisurely thriller, more interesting than heart-stopping, with an unfortunate tendency to stall"
The plot... rips off the original - which was thin to begin with - and makes it worse.
Unfortunately&#44; the movie&#8217;s worst enemy is its structure&#46;
"This comedy is generally tame and sappy... what we get is homogenized Eddie Murphy, drained of his kinetic comic charm and smiling sass."
"Dull, witless, and exhaustingly incomprehensible affair."
The horror of this mostly horrorless movie consists of the title water gushing from every plumbing orifice available. It may be icky but it sure isn't scary.
"There's always room for poetic licence but, by veering too far from the original texts, it loses some of the magic and seems destined to be chalked up as an opportunity missed."
... is ultimately undone by its corny conventionality.
It's ironic that a film about an attempt that had some pretty serious flaws feels like its creators made a few mistakes of their own.
"There is a fascinating story buried in Iverson... Director Zatella Beatty does her best to tease it out of her subject. But her greenness at the helm shows, as she relies heavily on a cloying score, obvious imagery, and a simplistic structure."
"Besson provided the story and co-wrote the screenplay for a film directed by McG, who does his usual McGhastly job with action and is McGruesome when it comes to comedy."
The film is not so much an insightful examination about how a college-educated man turns into a psychopath as much as it's a peculiar relationship tale between a skilled liar and his too-trusting single mom girlfriend.
"Disappointingly, the talented Lasse Hallström has reduced the poignancy and earthiness to cinematic dross"
"The genre's recent past has set the bar quite high, and Treasure Planet doesn't quite make it over."
"While an improvement over its 2012 predecessor, director Marc Webb's follow-up is ... camp without conviction; a Batman & Robin-style scenery chewer in a Batman Begins era."
"Overall, it's all a bit rubbish, but if you like Brendan Fraser's big rubbery face then there's chuckles to be had."
"Many races ensue, but Drift remains strictly for motorheads."
"Meanders in a slow, tiresome way."
"Crichton's cautious, forward-looking book had Frankenstein underpinnings: Don't mess with Mother Nature, or the past. The curators of the park do both, the filmmakers do the latter."
The best thing I can say about Unicorn Store is its only 92-minutes long.
Chan's worst Hollywood film to date.
"A movie that tries to connect with a universe that is hostile and even cruel. The third film is, by far, the least inspired of the saga. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Depp prances about the screen..., slurring and swaying, but he's no joy to watch."
"The remake also features a powerhouse cast, including an under-used Billy Crudup as Theresa's sculptor husband -- but oh what a clunky, at times cringe-worthy affair the film turns out be."
Just dissipates in a puff of its own indifference.
"More music and less listening to this jerk might have made the film more rewarding. Hey, Cameron, there's a reason he has no friends."
A psychedelic splash by Roger Corman noted only for its leads Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper.
The film is so overly busy that its background touches become welcome distractions.
"Although not worse than the prequels for me, The Last Jedi is its own special kind of meh that demonstrates Disney doesn't have the guts to do this franchise any justice."
"To sooy einai olo stimeno pano ston Steve Martin poy den dinei edo mia ap' tis ermineies gia tis opoies tha einai gia poly perifanos, sterontas ap' to starato boithitiko cast poy plaisionei tin omada ereyniton toy, stigmes apogeiosis"
There were a lot of missteps with this project... I think [Ben Platt] should have just ended on a high in the Broadway show.
"Simply on the story level, ""Amador"" could have been a better film."
"Too many unanswered questions and story holes, but the martial arts and strong female characters made it bearable to watch. May be too violent for some kids."
"Mini is impossible to like, especially since she delivers some of the worst narration ever spoken, and her final lines are like a big middle finger to viewers foolish enough to enjoy the film."
Second Act has some promising moments but the comedy starring Jennifer Lopez falls into cliche-filled traps that are otherwise disappointing.
"Unreal, politically dumb premise with Howell in blackface ."
The need to weave an emotional thread throughout the narrative somewhat undermines the blockbuster battles and reduces the anticipated fun.
"For all the money poured into Justice League, the effects have a slapdash, unfinished quality. Perhaps the talented FX people were too busy working on Thor."
"There's nothing inside, nothing to connect the film with the emotions of living people."
"[Depp] does make the experience far more watchable than it ought to be...with his eccentric, outwardly violent manifestations of his inner turmoil"
"Like a cut-rate Heathers, this film wants to explore the dark side of teen class warfare but has few tools with which to conduct its study."
Most of it is the same high school comedy we've been watching since John Hugh's heyday 20 years ago. Everyone is either popular and cruel (because in teenager-land one de facto means the other) or awkward and thus fair game for the popular kids.
It's based on the scene that plays out every day in the checkout line at Walmart.
A Chiara becomes a bit of a slog as it circles the same scenarios and revelations for extended periods of time. 
"Sounds like nothing especially unusual in straight-to-tape thriller land, but when Jennifer Tilly is cast as the psycho wife, what you get is camp nirvana."
A return to form it definitely isn't.
"Is this classic miscasting. Kristen Stewart? The fairest one of all? In a pure, who's hot and who's not contest, Charlize Theron -- wicked queen or not -- wins in a slam dunk."
Irritating rather than affecting...
Would play better as a study of the human predisposition toward infidelity were its characters not so illogically single-minded and its atmosphere not so cheap-romance-novel trashy.
"While the film is, indeed, freewheeling, some of us prefer to call it out of control."
Underwritten.
Should've been better for a John Hillcoat movie. [Full review in Spanish]
Its sporadic droll moments tempt one to view it with a charitable eye until patience is exhausted by the end.
"At least the movie's good for about 30 minutes of unintentional laughter, which doesn't say much for the other 90-plus minutes."
"For the record, The Butterfly Effect has absolutely nothing to do with butterflies, and its only obvious 'effect' is to make you want to take a shower."
"...almost every scene is inexplicable and devoid of common sense including the ending. And, speaking of endings, it seems to me that it is time that Neeson puts an end to these woefully weak follow-ups to 'Taken,' or find better material."
"Will Smith shows some promise trying to find a cure for a horrific virus, but somehow the plot becomes Shrek, Bob Marley and God trying to save the world."
"Wadlow doesn't have an inspired resume, and it should come as no surprise that his confused take on the series is downright painful to sit through."
Bird-brained animated comedy that won't fly.
"Some of this is fun and inventive, some of it repetitive and feeble, especially the heavy emphasis on the naivety of the protagonists and the hopelessness of their attempts at cool."
"San Andreas is such a programmatic, by-the-numbers film, genre-savvy viewers could practically recite along with the script."
"Bland, brooding coming-of-age drama wastes talented cast."
It's certainly not meant for the discerning viewer.
"The classic tale has been re-envisioned as both a buddy comedy and an action movie, making it wildly uneven, veering between bad banter and often savage violence."
"The trouble with the movie is that its dramatic content is almost as thin as Reznik's extremities, and nearly as obvious as the ribs that poke through his skin."
"When you should be terrified of Domenick, James doesn't allow it. He's a distraction here; a risk gone wrong. A bold idea that simply doesn't compel."
"The whole movie is so generic feeling and such a blatant waste of precious smart-comedy resources, I can't advise anyone to see it. I gave it Network with Snacks because Jason Bateman needs a vehicle for his brilliance wherever he can get one."
A generic action movie that's being released in theatres only because it stars well-known actors. [Full review in Spanish]
"There's lots of fighting, which is a good thing because the action in this movie is better than the talk. But that isn't saying much."
Super BAD!
"At the risk of sounding like a buzzkill, it does also become clear that the film has no clue what to do with its one essential gag beyond repeating it. "
&#8220;The Lone Ranger&#8221; loses itself in its overbearing insanity and bloated&#44; uneven plot&#46; It never feels like a western and it never knows when to end&#46;
"In the end, it retains its status as a journey to who-knows-where, yet probably not in the way its original author intended."
"[Hoffman] sticks too close to the storys stage roots, resulting in claustrophobic scenes and some trite plot complications that are uncovered in dialogue rather than action."
Delivers the frat-boy goods but its coarseness and vulgarity limit its appeal to relatively undemanding audiences.
"Wants to be a short story by Cheever or Updike or Roth but can't help but being what it inescapably is, an impotent cry of 'Yes I Can Do Literary' from a screenwriter whose idea of literary has been permanently Hollywoodized."
Torture. Impossible to imagine how it could've been worse.
feels more like a stopgap than a return to the franchise's past form... relentlessly (and uninspiringly) efficient - like a sleek new model Terminator.
"Pawn Shop Chronicles goes from curious to overkill in a hurry, cementing the director's reputation as a fire hose of a filmmaker, perhaps biologically incapable of subtlety."
"Life may be as unfair and arbitrary as Solondz portrays it, but it is arguably more diverse in its moods and its ups and downs. The film may not be a dog, but nor is it likely to become anyone's best friend."
"It's entertainingly nasty, but never becomes more than that."
Will there be more Black Adam movies? I don't know but it might be best to say Shazam and hope for the best.
The director seems to feel something for these characters&#44; but conveys little beside a figurative &#8220;sorry&#46;&#8221;
Gosling's smirk conveys a contempt for the material rivaled only by my own.
Should appeal to blase high schoolers who enjoyed Cruel Intentions and crave a stronger tragicomedy of bad manners.
A movie that promises to skewer sentimentality about children and the parents who live their lives through them ends up as an arrested adolescent's cry for help. Bateman should have recognized that as a creative SOS.
"Strictly dullsville -- a lackluster thriller and inept romance, directed with remarkable lack of imagination by Taylor Hackford."
"There's not a whole lot going on. This is a war movie without a major battle. ... Mendes, a director of indisputable talent, just can't seem to find his footing."
"Watching 'Music and Lyrics' is like watching an exceptionally good cover band imitate Wham! or Duran Duran. They'll manage to hit all the familiar notes, but there won't be any surprises or any sound that's not already on your CDs at home."
Zzzzzzzz. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Ulph. Umph. Ach. ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzz.
"Stewart does get his points across in a comedic satire which sometimes hits upon the normalized insanity of contemporary politics, but only enough to suggest a much more potent critique lies mostly dormant beneath the weight of extraneous tangents."
"Somewhere in the middle, the film compels, as Demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems, but the field of roughage dominates."
Ode to Joy fails to live up to its title by attempting to wring comic mileage from a medical condition that sufferers probably don't find very funny.
"Harmless, innocuous froth which could have been worse."
"The franchise will eventually, like all things, come to an end ... Sex and the City 2 is one step closer to that inevitability, so there is hope in it."
"We've watched this young man struggle and fight for answers, only to have them drop into his lap at precisely the right moment. It's a drastic misstep that ruins whatever chance Lion had of doing justice to a fascinating true story."
There's nothing terribly involving or enlightening in this brooding fever dream about life and death on the dingy margins of the city.
"Although entertaining in fits and starts, the filmization too often has the flavor of a reheated leftover from the Guy Ritchie menu."
"While there are entertaining moments, mainly from Foxx and Gordon-Levitt, they're not enough to deliver a competent film."
"The humorous linchpin in the movie rests on a running (so to speak) gag about irritable bowel syndrome. The Coens need to do better than that, but they don't."
"On the one hand, it could seem like some kind of triumph to see a young black filmmaker play in the same shallow end of the pool, but given that she's already helmed two other (better!) features, this feels like the worst kind of regression."
Aspires toward the transcendence of Tarkovsky but is more likely to appeal to fans of Carlos Castaneda and peyote buttons.
"While the book works fine for the younger set, the film tries to be too much an Alice-in-Wonderland-class story for all ages, but it rarely works for both young and old at the same time."
"Even allowing for genre limitations, this is a very bad movie indeed."
It's Die Hard in the Oval Office again
The predictable story and hackneyed dialogue -- the interplay between April and Casey is particularly bad -- get in the way of the movie's slick and sleek visual style.
"As raw exploitation, Nurse 3D [...] over-promises and under-delivers, which might have been inevitable with a title like that."
"Earns an A for ambition but a grade average lowered by prolixity, pomposity, murky complexity and an excess of perversity."
This wants to be as wild and brilliant as the original but isn't.
"Stephen Frears is a supremely accomplished director, but perhaps there was little he could do with this garbled and unsatisfying story about gambling."
"There's a bright side: If I had to choose between Vikander's Tomb Raider and [Michael Fassbender's] Assassin's Creed, I'd go for her unremarkable Tomb Raider. I'd rather some shut-eye than a stress headache."
"It takes some sort of talent to make a film as completely strident, overbearing, heavy-handed and downright off-putting as The Life of David Gale, although it's not exactly clear what type of talent it requires."
Talks Sin and Salvation while spending all his creative energies on debasing gags and sneering wide-angle shots
"Noma: My Perfect Storm doesn't reflect in its form chef Redzepi's obsession with food, which in this case turns out to be a fatal flaw. The film is too fixated on what's in his head to truly appreciate what he's making with his hands."
"""Into The Woods"" has its moments, especially any time Streep is on screen, but as it strains on at an overlong two hours, the glitter of fairy tale movie magic diminishes, leaving only a pale shadow."
"What's the difference between slasher films and chick flicks? In slasher films they suffer less, and they die quicker. Evening, bless its banal heart, is a chick flick in all its fatuous glory."
"Yes, you would watch Ian McKellen and Helen Mirren in virtually anything. You just wish it wasn't this."
"For those who aren't burdened by such things, the loopy, off-kilter pace and frontal-lobe frying provide their own unconventional pleasures."
"The film is a second-rate ""Air Force One"" mashed up with a third-rate ""Die Hard,"" with Gerard Butler striving mightily to be charismatic as the One Man Who Can Save the Day."
... a conclusion that promises that we'll have to endure a sequel whenever someone finally decides how the originally movie actually ended.
Generous souls may try to blame this travesty of the Deadline comic-strip on the studio execs who forced director Talalay to tone down and re-edit her cut.
Feels like a good stage play that never quite makes a full transition into the world of movies.
"""They don't make 'em like this anymore"" will be used as both a compliment and an insult to this conservative corrective. Both interpretations apply."
"The Coopers are, quite simply, bad company."
"The action isn't consistent or frequent enough, while the humor and the romance subplot aren't strong enough to make up for the downtime."
A very familiar story with few surprises. [Full Review in Spanish]
"much like Alvin at two crucial points in his life, Campos gets lost in the woods here, buckling under the disparate tones of its cast and Pollock's overbearing presence on the material."
Doesn't work despite Thornton's top performance.
"The best case scenario for this film is that a director's cut eventually turns Exodus: Gods and Kings into the ambitious, personal epic it tries but mostly fails to be."
It is vastly less entertaining than the behind-the-scenes credit sequence showing how some of the scenes were filmed.
"A deafening, blinding department store Blu-ray demo reel that's spun wildly out of control!"
"The film grows on you, but more substance and less calculated quirks would have been a royal treat."
"Hart is laser-focused and in-the-moment, and is consistently better than everything around him. He and Gad have the makings of a Will Smith and Kevin James in ""Hitch"" thing going on, but the script doesn't allow them to explore that dynamic."
"What's under the bed? Who's behind that door? What's making those vaguely satanic noises? These and other thought-provoking questions are entertained in Mama, a visually polished but overly repetitive chiller."
"I would ask any up-and-coming special-effects artist: Just because you can mold a convincing replica of a 6-year-old's severed arm, does it necessarily mean that you should?"
Dumb as dirt.
Ricky Gervais very much plays the hits in an undercooked but occasionally funny big screen revival that suffers from a crippling case of de ja vu. Brent's last goodbye? You'd hope so.
"...promises more than it delivers, ultimately providing a muddled narrative that does nothing to convince us of its moral positions."
Disappointing... Ultimately feels like an infomercial for Elon Musk.
"This by-the-numbers teen thriller is so formulaic that it makes a good date movie. You can predict what happens and devote half your time to snogging, say."
Collaborators always talk about how hard Cruise works to nail the moment or perfect that fight scene. But where's the vulnerability? Where's the heart? It's time for the superstar to get human again
"Candyman: Farewell To The Flesh is content to rely on easy jolts and an overabundance of fake-out scares, rather than hard-earned suspense."
"There's an uneven quality to Lucky Grandma, and it's this that ultimately leaves the film as a slightly unsatisfying beast. Chin's central performance, though, is a delight."
"It's a fault of the script, not the actors, that ""The Wife"" hangs on such a preposterous through line."
"Unless you really, really, really need to scare your partner into staying in your relationship, maybe pass this one by."
"The movie isn't, to paraphrase a line from ""Spaceballs,"" the stupidest combination you've ever heard. But it's not very good, either."
"Transsiberian makes suspenseful and sometimes violent gestures, but it's all decoration."
"The violence is of the high-minded, self-congratulatory sort that indicates without actually showing. This enables macho-but- sensitive cineastes to revel remorselessly in the idea of decapitated heads, sliced necks and severed limbs."
"Christopher Reeve was working on when he died, and they had to finish it for him, right? He should have had a better monument than this."
Any degree of tension cultivated by Polanski is frequently undermined by Rafael Yglesias and Ariel Dorfman's sputtering script.
"As a whole, the ideas, themes, and talent the film brings together don't quite blend well enough to be satisfying in this otherwise generic crime thriller."
"Barry Levinson has a real knack for inoffensive, perfectly safe drama that feels fossilized from another era of TV."
"The film is a dissection of damaged goods, but in place of a steady hand guiding matters to believable and sympathetic ends, director Bill Maher (not that one) takes the picture to unwanted extremes of behavior and guilt."
"I felt like it was an interesting idea, there were definitely times where I jumped, and it had a really cute dog in it named Kramer. There were just more parts that I didn't enjoy that outweigh the good."
Hipster filmmaking-by-numbers.
"Alonso Ruizpalacios has the bones of a slam dunk heist movie and a promising cast. Unfortunately, despite Bernal's star power, the material somehow gets away from the filmmakers like so many unfenceable antiquities."
This misfire only sinks its teeth into bland monotony&#59; vampires aren&apos;t the only things that suck within its frames&#46;
"The pair have obvious chemistry. That doesn't mitigate the stupidity and predictability of the plot, but at least it's not painful to sit through."
"The movie is one long argument, tiresome and repetitive, that produces more heat than light."
"Adamson claims that this was a labor of love, but it leaves you with the feeling that it was made for those who've read the book, and in such a lackadaisical approach to storytelling that it's unlikely to attract new fans."
A missed opportunity.
"Not every joke in the script by Danny McBride and Ben Best revolves around the word ""f**k"" - just every other joke."
To see Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie in The Tourist is like watching a chemistry experiment gone horribly wrong.
"While most of the acting here is unexceptional and the direction/editing often reflects odd choices,... the movie's intended demographic of adolescent and teenage girls will likely not care."
"I know it's harder to write good jokes than it is rotten ones, but based on what's displayed here, it doesn't seem like the effort was even made."
"Misdirection and mis-direction are the central problems with Focus, which is an ironic title if ever there was one."
"Hansen-Løve portrays both Maya, other Indian characters and the country at large with nuance and dimensionality. But she comes a little close to the line separating affectionate portrayal from exploitative navel-gazing."
The underlit setting occasionally produces unsettling&#44; suggestive imagery&#44; but the technique took me out of the movie&#46;
No amount of scenery-chewing from Robert Downey Jr. or familiar voices can make Dolittle even remotely passable; it's a disaster
"Substitute his sex addiction for, say, alcohol or cocaine, and it's a tale that's been told countless times."
"While it gets credit for audacity, the film suffers from amateurish performances and ignores the ethical ramifications of its characters' behavior."
You could call it One Flew Over the Mutant's Nest if it had an ounce of wit or personality.
The fight scenes themselves are dead dull. Two motorised robots slugging it out? Big deal!
Cohen's mix of ineptitude and laziness propels this to become one of the worst comedies in recent memory.
"What's been missing from the series since the first film is a strong, memorable adversary."
Little more than a series of loosely connected (and fairly effective) action set pieces.
Lives interconnect in slow-paced drama with brief violence.
Bounds from one contrivance to the next.
James and Mays are engaging and a handful of moments do generate genuine laughs. Not enough to justify a paid night at the movies...
"The movie doesn't have one genuine moment of imagination, good timing or comic inspiration."
Long before the film arrives at its sentimentally corny ending&#44; it&#8217;s not a question of &#8220;your place or mine&#8221; but rather &#8220;is this rom-com Hell&#63;
"If there is one novelty in director Carlo Carlei's take on the world's best-known ill-fated lovers, it's that the words aren't entirely Shakespeare's. It's a fresh approach, indeed, but maybe not the wisest."
"A great performance from Amber Heard can't save Syrup from its half-baked, sluggish script and obnoxious complacency."
Army of the Dead is more interested in playing with fun concepts than in actually being a fun movie.
Its shapelessness and the cultural differences in acting style will keep this version filed under 'cult oddity.'
"Malcolm & Marie is the kind of film that relentlessly comments on itself to create the illusion of self-awareness, when all it does is highlight the weakness of its author's convictions."
It's probably a warning sign when a director's strongest feature is a Step Up movie.
"The simplistic philosophy and cast of characters out of Hollywood's bag of cliches are bad enough, but do we have to be confronted with women's female problems, too?"
The recycled spectacle of yet another downsized U.K. working-class type being reduced to an act of feel-good against-all-odds crowd-pleasing redemption.
"It holds your attention, all right, but Russell's intentionally self-defeating manner (the film only exists to make fun of itself) seems pretty pointless here."
"Poor John Travolta acts his award-craving heart out, practically begging for acclaim."
The drama suffers: The Dixie Chicks don't provide a rebellious force to rise against the inanity they faced.
"The camera should never leave the four walls of the Riyad family home. Beyond that story, there is a dullness to the pacing and the wider tale of the Iraqi elections."
"A purpose-free, self-serious yawner that is just dreary, uninspired and hopelessly forgettable."
"As a time-waster, Knight and Day is entertaining enough. It sets the bar low then clears it effortlessly. But as I creep into the damning- with-faint-praise department, reviewing this film feels as pointless as watching it."
"""Somewhere within the countless hours of footage shot for the project is a truly stunning movie that sheds light on America's imperialism. Sadly, it's not there on the screen."""
"The concept is cute and the movie starts out well, but it devolves into a muddled, overstuffed mess that wears out its welcome around the time the novelty of 3-D effects wears off."
More a nope than a yep...
"[A] romantic frothfest, which aims to be part Ealing comedy, part Local Hero, part ’Allo ’Allo!, but is not quite the measure of any of those. "
Agonizingly pedestrian.
"When you look beyond all the visuals, it's pretty dull."
More painful than the average bear attack.
"A lusting addiction to cartoonish carnage drags Kingsman: The Secret Service down. And by the end, the movie's out-sexismed Roger Moore-era 007 at its smarmiest and smuggest. Lesson learned--cock-of-the-walk dickishness knows no class bounds."
"Mr. Holmes just about gets the job done thanks to McKellen and Parker, but too many mediocre elements ensure this affair is a sad waste of a strong concept."
"It's a shame Silent Hill: Revelation suffers the same doomed fate as most modern horror movies, bumbling through a shockingly disconnected screenplay which strings together moments that could have been salvaged otherwise."
"If you have any inclination to see this, just rewatch the original. You will lose nothing, and you'll have a far better time."
Relatively silly and far too long disaster movie.
"All in all, this might've played better as a Blu-ray extra."
"Shot Caller is a paycheck for several performers who should know better, nothing more."
The result is a movie that can be admired in many respects from a distance but is progressively less emotionally engaging.
"The Spanish-language drama ""Everybody Knows,"" is not a bad movie. In fact, it's half-decent, but the problem is we've come to expect much more from him."
"There's no need for character assassination here. But the absence of darker, more contradictory revelations of his nature leaves Che bereft of complexity. All that remains is a South American superman: uncomplex, pure of heart, defiantly pious and boring."
"If you want Tom Cruise on autopilot, wait for the Top Gun sequel..."
"The film's languid construction mirrors content, the dull everyday of real police routine rather than the usual police procedural."
A fascinating and genuinely important period in American history is underserved here by an inelegant structure and unwieldy running time.
"though the grander themes will translate for audiences across the globe, Feng's Spielbergian desire to over-sentimentalise every scene means that overall, Youth is more frustrating than affecting."
A movie where love means diarrhea.
"A toothless ode to a still-living celebrity, it's a film that may appeal to very young children and very old ladies, but seems sure to bore everyone in between."
"The story's length, lack of sets, music, or a focused story combine to make one of the most excruciatingly dull cinematic experiences I can remember."
"Bland, forgettable, expensive action..."
You're Next aims for the middle and lands there.
"In the end, the film is far less affecting or thought-provoking than the book."
"...the adults who take [the kids] to see the movie won't feel too good about themselves, or their existences, or the state of life on the planet, as the lights go up."
Gets lousier by the minute...likely to satisfy only those who thrive on the most insipid network fare.
"The movie has more clichd rebirths in mind, and you'll resent where it goes."
A typically erratic anthology horror film...
"While this risk has its pay-offs and its flaws, overall, the film is predictable and clichd, and I more than once had a feeling of dj vu."
"In the end, the whole shebang comes off like a bunch of snotty, rich white kids screwing each other and screwing each other over."
"The convincing effects will only whet your appetite and leave you hungry for something more substantial, as you're left to wonder which cast members knew the campiness of the concept."
"Brilliant visuals aside, bird-brained jumps litter the plot. E.g., baby sis' terrible malady, gl-owl-coma if you will, inexplicably disappears moments later. Talk about your fly-by-night conditions."
"That this particular retelling of the Jane Austen novel feels like a Cliffs Notes version is understandable; that its zombie bits are equally rudimentary, though, is more disappointing."
"Eventually, the filmmakers reveal the secrets they'd previously withheld, spoiling the film's sustained mystique."
"The problem is that since all these kids are so blank, only Stillman, as the narrative voice, is in on his many jokes."

"The movie never manages to hit above a dim emotional pitch, and a final-act awakening lands with a shrug."
The whole tie-in with crime and 'gangstas' has been covered so many times in rap music videos that the film ends up feeling like recycled tripe.

"Director Kelly Reichardt, who also penned the film with her regular screenwriter, Jonathan Raymond, has created a tiresome bubble inside a bubble, focusing their lens to pointless effect on a group of low-level artists in Portland, Oregon."
Blends exuberant comedy with soppy romance that eventually sinks it.
"For those who don't equate sexual appetite with the intricacies of fly fishing, Nymphomaniac: Vol. 1 is more tiresome than titillating."
Pitch Perfect isn't particularly bad. It isn't particularly anything. And that's what's most disappointing about it. That so many talented people could have worked so hard to produce something so... nothing.

This would-be spoof of romantic comedies falls prey to the misconception -- common in modern American humor -- that to make reference to something is the same thing as parodying it.

"Washington is a wonderful voice, but his readings of Coltrane's words don't match seeing the artist in motion. The constant stream of still photos, with a recognizable actor's voice, has a distancing effect."
The warmth that might have made this film work never materializes and slickness is no substitute.
Cars 2 demonstrates that not every hit movie merits a sequel.
"The Professional is all over the map, and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant."

Ticket to Paradise is money well spent by the Bali tourism board&#44; as it is showcased in all its glory&#46; But the filmmakers must have been too caught up being tourists&#44; as the actual film never offers anything worth recommending&#46;
"Predictable, cutesy and nowhere near hot-blooded enough for a story about two friends with benefits who can't keep their hands off one another."
Proves to be a laborious and often frustrating fourth entry in a franchise that had its day over 20 years ago.
"Watchable, well acted satirical drama that starts well but quickly loses its bite and tails off into sentimentality and a cop-out ending."
"Desperately trying to say something complex, it only manages to look as if it said something that mattered."
"[...] When it isn't head-smackingly obvious, is clumsily rushed and incoherent."
"It's not the actors' fault that no one is able to break through the film's gorgeous but chilly surface. You watch Casino with respect and appreciation, reveling in its documentary sense of detail."

D'Souza manipulates viewers' passions while telling them who to blame for their bile.
"""Only Living Boy"" fails to convince as a character study, romance or love letter to the CBGB-era New York City."
"An 83-minute film that somehow feels stretched out longer than it should be, both because of pacing issues and because there's zero mystery behind the central narrative mystery. A puerile comedy with bursts of greatness."
"In short ""Bad Boys"" is incredible. ""Bad Boys 2"" is insane. ""Bad Boys For Life"" is an almost instantly forgettable franchise bookend, or is it? Maybe it's time we start reading the title with the upward inflection of Ron Burgundy."
"Unlike the April and May releases of Trolls World Tour and Scoob!, you don't have to pay a single dime for Artemis Fowl. That may be the best news of this entire film. You'll only lose 90 minutes of your life to this misbegotten mess."
Blair and Saulnier render Giraldi's plot as a jumble of disquieting images and inexplicable character choices.
"A witless, listless muck-up that sends you reeling from the theater with thoughts of suicide instead of a chipper grin."
"There is spectacle enough in Marshall's movie -- rows of geisha trainees aligned in formation like Rockettes, acres of low, cedar-and-bamboo buildings with mountains in the distance -- but nothing that comes close to lyricism."
"Despite flashes of brilliance, Chappie's script often resembles a list of stuff that would be cool to see in a movie rather than an actual story."
Imagine a film portrait of Jimi Hendrix without the drugs that killed him at 27 and the rock that would make him immortal.
"Though pictorially it is very satisfying, M. Renoir has mixed high tragedy and low comedy.to such an extent that one is bewildered."
"Hawke's film, a boring, pretentious waste of nearly two hours, doesn't tell you anything except that the Chelsea Hotel today is populated by whiny, pathetic, starving and untalented artistes."
"Pacino spends most of the two-plus hours of ""Jack"" being a distraction in his own movie."
"Intricate but curiously drab...for all the cigarettes that are smoked and talked about in the movie, it's resolutely non-addictive."
"I understand that Eastwood meant well, and it is interesting to fill up a tried-and-true movie formula with this much frank racism in order to make it different, but Gran Torino is just a well-intentioned mess."
Never gets beyond stereotypes.

An embarrassing parody of the first 5 films...
"The themes about corporate greed and blood being thicker than money resonate, but that doesn't save the film from predictability and cliché."
&#91;T&#93;he haphazard way this story is assembled makes it seem as if the filmmakers were more concerned with &#46;&#46;&#46; &#91;the&#93; little details than the bigger ones&#46;
This movie is awkwardly structured.

Everyone would be happier if these films were melted down or buried. Or both.
"The situation at the heart of Mine - what to do if you're stuck standing on a live landmine - is fascinating to imagine. But sadly, the film eventually devolves into cliched flashbacks and quickly loses momentum."
"You'll wonder if the message of the movie is that the process of adoption turns women into vicious hags. But that can't be right, can it?"
"A vast repository of hoary, honour-code clichs."
The rare raunchy comedy that actually could have stood to be a little longer-and not just by padding the running time with outtakes.
"A remake of the 1979 film, The Amityville Horror tries for a clasic sense of creeping suspense, but is sadly inept."
One of those movies adapted from a beloved novel whose fans can't believe it's been brought to the screen. They turn out to be right.
"If you loved Wolfe's book, you may very well hate the movie. If you simply liked the novel, you may be simultaneously entertained and disappointed by what De Palma and Cristofer have done to it."

The supporting cast alone is the worth of this film - see it for them.
"Screenwriter Alan Ball is no stranger to daring stories, but in his awkward film directorial debut he seems unable to capture the soul of Alicia Erian's novel &mdash; and with a story like this, that's disastrous."
This is one of those self- referential horror movies that gets buried alive in an avalanche of clever special effects and an incredible imploding plot.
Don't blame the progressive nods for film's failures ... the limp plot does the damage.

The Innocents is torn between the severity of its story &#46;&#46;&#46; and the fantastical quality of its central gimmick&#46;
"A film that tried to get rid of the game's plotting to elaborate an action product that although there demonstrated ambition to grow different and propositive, probably entangled itself so fast because of its own artifices. [Full review in Spanish]"
"For those keeping score, style just scored another touchdown against substance."
"Tedious, dull and anticlimactic despite decent performances and exquisite cinematography filled with bleak images. It's ultimately an underwhelming experience that lacks emotional resonance."
You can't help feeling that there's more to this story than ever meets the eye.
"Let the record show I witnessed a screening of the misbegotten action sequel Terminator Genisys three days ago. In the hours that followed, I sent a cyborg back in time to Hollywood 2012 to prevent this abomination from ever getting a green light."
"""Fright Night"" always seems to be heading toward another obligatory uninspired set piece, including a too-dark-to-see-in-3-D car chase and too-boring-to-care basement stakeout, both of which dilute the movie's Coumadin-thin metaphors about adolescence."
"It's a holiday farce in a minor key, suitable for the not-ready-for-PG-13 crowd, too boring for anybody else."
"Certainly there's no need to spend so much time with Theron's character as she yells at her subordinates to ""do something!"" or whispers throatily to Dom that he has no choice but to follow her orders or else."
A torturously slow meditation on the tribulations of immigrant farmers that strains for an elegiac tone.
"Ugh. I didn't just hate ""The Hustle."" I despised it. It stole 90-plus minutes of my life. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sexual Content, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
"It's an utter slog, and there's nothing worse to say about a movie whose entire, solitary purpose in life is to provide mindless, violent escapism."
"Copley gives the year's worst performance. The South African actor portrays ""The Stranger"" with the kind of showy effete glee usually reserved for mustachioed villains who tie women to train tracks in silent movies."
Vantage Point is a patented representative of this year's early mediocrity. Vantage Point is trailer trash.
"If you're looking for signs of intelligent life -- well, did you really expect to find them in a remake of a Seventies B-movie anyway?"
"Yep, it might have taken seven years, but the 300 franchise has returned with more hysterically historical butchery for your entertainment pleasure."
Everything is one hundred percent predictable.
"The film is interesting in its portrayal of rock 'n' roll on the road, though it's unsuccessful as a whole."
"For a film about resolving communication gaps, ARRIVAL creates too many of them."
"Didn't Brett Ratner already make this movie, twice, between orchestrating something similar with ""Tower Heist"" and directing Brosnan in ""After the Sunset""?"
"It's a clunky, luminous mess that ultimately suggests that a person who has lived to be more than 100, raised a daughter, traveled the world, learned a ridiculous number of languages, and had a lot of adorable pets hasn't lived until she finds a man."
The staging and the formal beauty of the film is trapped in a literal interpretation of psychological realism that is maddening. [Full review in Spanish]
"The Goldfinch isn't a filmmaking travesty, but it is a mess, a movie trying so hard to be prestigious that it fails to be anything at all."
Perhaps this was intended to draw the largely female crossover audience that went to Joy Luck Club. But the dual stories don't mesh well.
"Hancock's surface-skimming script is too formulaic for the job. There's enough material here for a crisp 90-minute entertainment. At 2+ hours, the leisurely, mildly engaging A Perfect World barely sputters across the finish line."
"As far as this sort of movie goes, you could do a lot worse."
"Noble intentions don't always net smashing results, and such is the case with the disappointing ""Tomorrowland"" ..."
"Putting Ben Affleck, and the poor man's Ben Affleck, Ryan Reynolds, in the same movie? Not a good move."
"Branagh is upstaged by his moustache as master detective Hercule Poirot. His retro mystery offers a deluxe journey to the past, but this pokey train goes off the rails about the time all the characters, except for Poirot, cease to matter."
"A minor entry into the canon of Harvey Weinstein auteur theory, a film that has particularly strong moments undercut by uneven character development as the story loses focus."
"There's nothing at all original, engaging, stimulating or thought-provoking (for all of these, see Invasion of the Body Snatchers) within its frames."
"Imagine if the pod race in Star Wars Episode I was as bad as everyone said it was, and took itself twice as seriously, and went on for more than two hours."
"This promisingly tragic tale is sunk by cartloads of context and an overbearing, slanted narration."
"It's hard to know who exactly ""Parental Guidance"" was made for."
"Clearly, neither writer Noah Haidle nor director Fisher Stevens knows what he's doing but they do, at least, appear to realize how lucky they are to have three old pros in their leading roles."
"As much as Melissa McCarthy is a presence worth watching in almost anything, it is difficult to get too excited about the low-key, wishy-washy ""Tammy."""
"Writer-director Michel Hazanavicius' The Artist is not for a nanosecond fun-though it works hard to be so. Basically, it is A Star Is Born knockoff."

"It once seemed creepy, but time has made it seem pretty contrived."
"This lifelong lover of all things dark, dank, and dreadful thinks that it could have been so much more effective sans the pointed polemics."
"The technical revels are arresting, but Seraphim Falls is slow of motive and thin of plot -- a western that dies with its boots on."
"The animation is still as smooth, colorful, and stunning throughout, but unfortunately, this time around the story isn't quite where it needs to be to make this an adventure worth another 90-minute investment."
"You may want to count your blessings that, for a movie filled with dog farts, baby-diaper 'bombs,' and kiddie vomit, the 'fragrant aromas' are mostly absent. But at least scratching-and-sniffing is something to do while you pray for the film to be over."
"So intently focused as he is on crafting an edgy and grown-up vision of the Batman world, Phillips sacrifices consistent character development, good scripting and editing."
"It's a well-composed and stylish but also confounding film, with sinister edges and a bloated plot to match the marquee-filler of a title."
Whenever the film is about to become interesting&#44; it tends to lean back on and resort to cheap&#44; predictable horror movie conventions&#46; At the very least&#44; Sosie Bacon displays exceptional believability in her performance&#46;
A viewer's response to the movie will probably relate directly to how much the viewer likes Prince to begin with.
The results are heavy-handed and oppressive in the way that vanity projects and bloated collective theatre experiments often are.
"In spite of Sharon Stone's hearty encore performance as the ultimate femme fatale, ""Basic Instinct 2"" falls unbearably flat."
"We left this giggling over all of the bad fishing jokes we could use in our review of the film, which is telling... it's certainly not the catch of the day."
"One of those spy thrillers that isn't nearly as thrilling, complex or engaging as the filmmakers think."
"The film's single saving grace is Turner, who channels that legendary Catholic guilt like there is no tomorrow."
"If Tyler Perry worked in construction, he'd use a sledgehammer when a tack hammer would get the job done. At least that's the impression given by his didactic film."
"Eight months after health-care reform was signed into law, Universal Pictures courageously weighs in with a watered-down satire of the pharmaceutical industry."

There are far more aspects of the film that may leave younger viewers confused and may not even be fun after lengthy parental explanations.
The Big Wedding is the kind of movie where casting Christine Ebersole as a woman named Muffin is seen as the height of comedy. No thanks.
"For the sake of moral complicity, Lyne injects an amorality that takes the steam out of this steamy potboiler."
Undercooked&#44; convoluted and redundant&#44; this franchise&#8217;s failure to properly evolve makes us yearn for its extinction&#46;
Re-imagining 'Little Red Riding Hood' as a police procedural was done 40-odd years ago by Stan Freberg when it was called 'Little Blue Riding Hood.' It was fresh then.
"As much of a hoot as the movie is, it feels like just an exercise well before it ends."
"The screenplay is a grab-bag of aimless scenes frequently getting in the way of Sandler's reasonably earnest, if flimsy attempt at a character study."
You gotta give De Niro a hand (and a maybe a tissue) for the way he dives right into this role. He chews through the icky dialogue and even lends the character some warmth in the process. The movie doesn't deserve it.
"If you leave the theater for even a minute, you'll be lost, given the way Come Undone jumps around."
"Michael B. Jordan certainly has the chops to carry a spy movie in league with The Bourne Ultimatum or Mission Impossible (the later films), but the script he's given to work with ultimately weighs him down."
The latest entry in the hackneyed lone-survivor genre offers little to revitalize it.
"Unfortunately, the more ""real"" the movie tries to make everything appear, the harder it becomes to ignore that the necessity to their falling in love isn't particularly romantic"

Terribly maudlin and ultimately exploitative.
I'm a fan of both Murphy and Fanning; but this film might be one they'll leave off their resumes.
"Mildly funny and ultimately able to find some pathos, Wilson nonetheless proves a dull entry into the world of downbeat literature that Clowes helped create with Ghost World"
"Unremarkable Internet gambling thriller, where every move made is a losing one."
"POTC was never about nuance, and now it's even less so: It's about watching Depp fall into peril and wriggle his way out, over and over, for hours."
"The moments don't add up to much, though, and the dramatic arc ends up feeling even narrower than it usually is in this kind of story."
"The plight of the aged is worthy of consideration, but a series of AARP fantasies do not a story make."
"A smoldering lump of action hokum...this lumbering behemoth is a pretty humorless affair, except for the unintended laughs the ludicrous excesses and general cheesiness are likely to provoke."
"A thinly-sketched, utterly pedestrian cop thriller that pivots on a very predictable twist ending."
A textbook example of a director prizing himself over his material.
"I'd call it a pointless endeavor, except now we might finally be able to pinpoint the source of Wilson's recent depression."
"Could have been a lot worse, but should have been much better ... it's a movie you can watch once and be entertained, but it probably could never sustain multiple viewings like the best summer fare."

"Reitman wants to have his cake and eat it, too."
"Yawn; real fannish obsession can be much more absurd, and unsettlingly fascinating, than this burlesque ever gets."
"The remake takes everything that was imaginative about the original feature and reduces it to an ear-splitting energy drink commercial, topped off with some of the worst filmmaking decisions to be found at the multiplex this year."
"On top of everything else, the direction is sloppy, the script is forced, and the whole thing feels like a bad hallmark film."
Ant-Man and the Wasp&#58; Quantumania feels less like it&#8217;s a small part of a bigger plan and more as if it&#8217;s being forced to work against its own interests to serve a grand design&#46;
"The endless cat-and-mouse game starts out silly, then it gets ridiculous."
Stage Fright tries too damn hard to sit with theater kids at lunch but secretly considers them losers.
"It's like watching a snuff film, only it's the audience who's dying inside."
"Solemn as a funeral march, humorless as your junior high principal, as Japanese as a grocery-store California roll, Keanu Reeves's let's-mope-about-and-kill-ourselves samurai drama has exactly three things going for it."
So vapid and shallow that even the most devoutly Catholic viewers will find themselves agreeing that it never comes close to become a viable film.
"With this story, and this cast, the movie ought to have been fun."
Brrrr. This study of a young girl's descent into a most rarefied form of whoring is as coldly clinical as it is annoyingly pretentious.

Forget being too old--Zac Efron is just too good for this.
"Creed III is a film that looks good, has some fleeting moments but never quite lives up to the previous two films. It winds up being a disappointing entry in a franchise I’ve grown to expect more from."
"PAW Patrol: The Movie is the MPAA working definition of ""mild peril,"" with what should be high-stakes disasters either handled with a puppy smile or so absurd that they just seem pleasantly silly."
"Too bad that Crash, which aims to explore the complexities of contemporary interracial relations, is such a flawed film artistically, a schematic tale with blatant sociological messages. One of the weakest films to win the Best Picture Oscar."
"Brandon Cronenberg, son of David, continues to rehash his father’s themes and preoccupations with this wearisome grand guignol body horror about the primal power of, yep, sex, death and reproduction. "

Morten Tyldum again reveals his limited ability to provide empathy and true depth to the characters. [Full Review in Spanish]

Zaniness has rarely been this obnoxious.
"It's as if the movie is half Honeymooners remake and half typical weak comedy, which doesn't add up to a whole lot of anything."
"One-liners tumble over one another, dulling their own impact. Plot points hurl from the screen with velocity, but fizzle from a lack of inspiration."
You notice the visual design but have no sense of - or feeling for - the faith binding these mourners.
The only thing more outdated than Cheaper by the Dozen's soundtrack is its hokey life lessons concerning the importance of family over career.
"David O. Russell's eccentric Philly-cheesesteak screwball comedy leaves me cold, but may prove to be his big crossover hit."
"No matter how daring today's comedies think they are, someone has been there before and done it funnier."
"Patricia Clarkson livens things up in a supporting role, but we spend far more time with April, who has no discernable personality."
Waking up during major surgery would be horrible. Waking up during surgery and being forced to watch Awake would be truly ghastly.
"Though there's nothing in it that could be considered offensive, including its occasional stabs at post-modernism, as a film experience it fails to exist."
"Everything about Benson Lee's predictable dance flick ""Battle of the Year"" strikes me as old."
If only it were as much fun as its trailer!
This is going to go down as one of the lesser films in the portfolios of Shelton&#44; Ford&#44; and most everyone else involved&#46;

"One of Marvel's most ambitious movies in years is also one of its weakest since ""Thor: The Dark World."""
"A real loser, lock, stock and barrel."
"Perhaps Seth MacFarlane thought that this would be a Blazing Saddles for a new generation, yet A Million Ways to Die in the West belongs way, way on the other side of the western comedy spectrum."
"The brutality is sickening, and unlike, say, the broken glass sequence in Bergman's Cries and Whispers--where the entire film built up to one brief, painful moment--it serves no overarching purpose, quickly becoming an exercise in haughty"
"as frightening as a game of tic-tac-toe, and about as complicated"
"Perfect for fans of the franchise; anyone else, though, will probably get bored and annoyed. [Full review in Spanish]"
"""Headhunters"" is a bit like an Ikea desk assembled with your nondominant arm -- sleek and attractive, but likely to fall to pieces if you look at it too hard."
"Whatever its problems, it's fun that the Hated Heigl gives up her ""America's Sweetheart"" dream and wears her resting bitch face with pride."
Parker's anti-Carrie Bradshaw messiness is coupled to a horse-like grin that is both sentimental and overcooked. I don't know how she gets away with it.
"Mikkelsen is routinely compelling as Martin, while the lives of his friends are presented as passing details."
"The movie lacks anything approaching a rhythm -- which, as everyone knows, is the record business' deadliest sin."
"Blood Car may have been collecting prizes and earning praise for its supposedly wickedly twisted satire but it still seems trashy, B-movie junk."
"""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" gives us too much hangover and not enough buzz."
Joy pursues a number of ill-fitting narrative detours that detract from the fascinating story that should be at the core of the movie. While I was rooting for the film-and for Joy herself - ultimately it felt like the film missed a key opportunity.
Perhaps the best strategy for enjoying the movie would be to a) leave sensitive tykes at home and b) bring a portable music player to provide an alternative soundtrack.
Stu Zicherman's amusing but formulaic man-in-crisis comedy has neither a fully realised protagonist nor a clear message.
Formulaic soap opera has the makings of camp but the heart of an after-school special.
The sparks are few in this labored romance.
"Even though multiple-sourced footage remains a potentially interesting way to shoot a movie, using this particular framing device really has become redundant."
"It seems to be fighting a battle against itself, and is visibly losing the closer it gets to its deflated climax."
"This is pleasant, of course, and who doesn't believe that music is the true universal language? But 96 minutes of uplift is a lot."
"It's an affront to our memories of the classic series, but the more serious crime is the poor use it makes of five supremely talented performers."
"Although it's not a cinematic lump of coal, it's clearly not the sort of movie present you'll cherish or want to revisit during the end of any given year. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
It's just as dull as the predecessor. [Full review in Spanish]
"It's a depressing, grubby-looking little film with an undercurrent of particularly mean-spirited misogyny. You wonder what Suzie Halewood, the director, was thinking."
Langdon isn't doing much this time around. There are a couple of puzzles to solve but the more prevalent scenes involve him running from the authorities Jason Bourne style.
"A beautiful, bland affair."
"Runner Runner starts off with a solid draw, then folds on the flop."
"This is the dullest, most incompetently assembled thriller of the summer... and remember, I've seen The Happening."
"A stroll down sitcom memory lane in name only, The Honeymooners seems as if any resemblance to the original TV classic could only be accidental."
"Is there something darker: an unhealthy fascination with unwholesome relationships and bad boys, perhaps mixed with a Nightingale/Stockholm-syndrome desire to ""save"" them?"
"Remains earthbound in narrative terms, forever hinting at the existence of a higher intelligence without evincing much of its own."
"The final third of the film, which is directed by Rogen and Evan Goldberg, degenerates into a humourless and violent Rambo pastiche."
"In this mix of recycled scares and half-hearted twists, the only real fright is the sight of an interesting actor wasting his talents in yet another mediocre movie."
"The angles don't quite meet in the key relationship between Ray and Carla. We're not sure what's between them -- love, lust, both or neither. That may be the filmmaker's intent, but it lowers the stakes."
"It's a highbrow romantic farce, without the laughs."
"The disjointed plot is a mlange of clichs with logic that feels conjured up on the spot. Magical legends are cobbled together as if by someone in Screenwriting 101. Or, as is the case here, by a half dozen writers, seemingly at cross purposes."
"The chief problem with ""Venom"" is that it never settles on a tone. Is it comedy? Horror? Romance? Drama? Why not try all of them at once?"
"The superhero as schlemiel returns...a tangled web of drippy, comic-book psychodrama."
"For an alien invasion film, this one is a solid effort, though there's a bit too much violence and not enough introspection."
....a whole lot of noisy nothing.
The failure here isn't from unpacking a troubling historical moment with humour. It's the erratic switches in the tone that confuse the film's mood and intentions.
Eye for an Eye sounds like a chore. [Full Review in Spanish]
"If D.W. Griffith's 1915 Civil War stunner, 'The Birth of a Nation,' was 'history writ with lightning,' in the famous phrase of President Woodrow Wilson, than Ted Turner's 'Gods and Generals' is history writ with sorghum..."
'Soul' is the one of the many things lacking in this sad excuse for a horror film.
Family drama has one-sided anti-euthanasia message.
The ambition isn&#8217;t lacking in this stylish period adventure&#44; although its unfocused execution too often defaults to crowd-pleasing cliches at the expense of genuine depth or insight&#46;
"Epstein and Friedman opt for the most broadly entertaining and salacious details about the 1972 porn film, giving short shrift to Lovelace's complicated contradictions."
The strongest contender imaginable for the worst picture of the summer.
"Ultimately, ""If I Stay"" is a just barely average teen weepie, enlivened by some pretty cello music but never coming to life."
"... a guarded comedy too gun shy to take its concept to the zany, over-the-top heights fans of Sandler have come to expect."
'Promising juvenilia' is about the most one can say for it.
"This really does feel like it’s missing something, perhaps the result of being rushed out after the renewed interest in horror post-Scream."
This was bad on so many levels&#46; Words cannot express how much I disliked this &quot;film&quot;&#46; 
Even though &#8220;White Noise&#8221; is supposed to be a black comedy&#44; it doesn&#8217;t feel funny because the characters are too earnest and serious&#46;
"The ending is so tacked on and moronic, it feels like the work of the dumbest focus group of all time."
Utilizing a traditionally glossy&#44; chick-lit-retrofitted heroine as a mouthpiece for somber&#44; serious activist sentiments isn&#8217;t so much provocative as just downright batty&#46;
"There's a whole lot of digging, but not much suspense or interest dug up in ""The Dig."""
"Pacing is a problem, as sequences setting up an intergalactic finale drag, particularly when the film spends far more time on Asgard, with almost none of the fish-out-of-water charm that made the first film work."
"Leonardo dolls up for danger? Okay, so there is a brief moment in J. Edgar where he dons his dead mother's dress and pearls. But maybe in a Norman Bates moment, he just misses her. In any case sorry, Clint did not make my day."
"With a few tweaks, the picture could have actually been about 12-year-old step-brothers, and been better for it."
In space no one can hear you yawn.
The ornate sadism isn&apos;t enough to carry our interest this time around&#46;
"Through 3D glasses too darkly, the extra dimension is not taken advantage of -- and in fact appears detrimental."
"The performances are uniformly good, but Training Day helmer Antoine Fuqua seems to lack the maturity as a filmmaker to match his casting or his budget."
The entire production is dumbed-down.
"Ghosts Of War wants us to think it's a psychological thriller but, truth be told, there's not a lot of depth here."
"If you really want to live life to the fullest, step one is to avoid wasting an hour and a half of your life in a theater showing Last Holiday."
A piece of sclerotic all-star machismo about as exciting as Veterans' Arm-Wrestling Night at the Hollywood Bowl.
The script is this film's weakest link - it's telling that most of the (few) laughs come from old-fashioned physical slapstick and the sight of Beatty in a bear suit.
The problem is that you feel the Farrellys' attention to detail may have gotten in the way of the larger mission - to create a workable movie around the central performances.
The film lacks for the methodically escalating stakes that makes the best examples of the genre so entertaining.
"Some of this might have passed for uproarious in a TV sitcom, although probably in an earlier decade than the one in which we're dozing through this movie."
"Fuqua and Washington have developed a body of work over the years that is, if nothing else, reliably kinetic. But with Wenk's pedestrian writing, there just isn't much for Washington to work with here."
"Vaughn's stylistic signature of balletic brutality is among the film's pleasures, although the narrative's hybrid tone - part academic, part acid trip - is not."
"...oh, look at all the crazy people."
"Director Carl Franklin, so crisp and economical in One False Move, bogs down in genre cliches here."
"Certainly the film is cute in places, but the larger ideas that little Leon is messing about with are never any more than cardboard cutouts, a child's approximation of political thinking."
"The result, sadly, falls far short of expectations, evoking a mood more Mills & Boon, or Merchant Ivory, than Herzog."
It ends up just feeling really bland and boring and slow.
"If it didn't make you constantly wonder whether some actors are standing closer to the camera than others, ""Gods of Egypt"" might pass muster as an occasionally lively and frequently campy B movie."
"Despite an impressive pedigree, iThe Tender Bari is too slight in most regards to be memorable. If anything, its a Hallmark movie with A-list talent, meant to make you feel good while you forget about it moments later."
"Davis, who grew up in the border town of McAllen, Texas, obviously wants to put a human face on the countless people who try to sneak across the border, but he fails to elicit any substantive information from his subjects."
One of the lamer superheroes in comic book and movie history.
Michelle Williams is a fine and versatile actor but even she has her limits and is never really convincing as a working-class Londoner struggling with guilt and grief.
Have talented actors ever struggled so much to so little avail? Ms. Diaz sells her lines like a street vendor peddling fake Timexes.
A ho-ho-hum yuletide comedy trying to shoehorn Vaughn's fast talking wise-guy brand into a warm and fuzzy Christmas confection that seems like it has been focus-grouped to smithereens.
Nearly everything about this film is a cliché.
"A few moments pack some power, but the overall experience is underwhelming and a bit boring. No amount of pretty pictures has the power to fix the mess that is this script."
"Much ado about nothing that needed to be rebooted in the first place. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)"
We need a villain instead of a victim if the happy romance between Rachel and Luce is going to work.
"Decent as a comedy, but it's ultimately forgettable because it gives no real air to what it's trying to puncture."
"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days may have tinkered with the rules, but it's still playing the same old game."
"[Interracial-buddy flicks] are back, and while they've gotten more sophisticated in some ways, they haven't necessarily gotten any better."
"...Ceylan's film is a monologue and a relentless one, leaving no room for us to interpret or engage with the material he presents."
"While it's visually striking, with superior acting, it's also cluttered with a bewildering collection of characters and plot threads."

What's limper than a self-referential indie about an aspiring filmmaker struggling to make a movie? One set in the superdirty porn industry!
A special effects-laden piece of trash...
"The rest of the film is on autopilot, with comic material that's spread thinner than the lone brain cell the Butabis share."
A movie that hopes its idiot demographic won't notice the wave of vile stink slopping off the screen.
"Under even the most cursory scrutiny, The Snowman simply melts."
&quot;Cell&quot; is empty and meaningless&#44; though it&apos;s gloomy and slow-moving enough to feign some philosophical weight&#46;

Energetic dance routines interrupted now and then by unlikely dialogue and wooden acting: Welcome to StreetDance 2.
"Much like Stallone's Expendables entries, Homefront's premise is more appetising on paper than it is in execution."
"Like so many Saturday Night Live skits, this film comes up with some interesting ideas but then doesn't have a clue what to do with them. Also like that show, this movie is just not funny."
"A cheesy riff on the 'Rosemary's Baby' and 'Omen' template, deserving of nothing more than rotation on the SyFy and Chiller networks."
"Gifted Mexican filmmaker Guillermo Del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth) makes an odd misstep with this overwrought gothic horror thriller, which is so bloated that it's more silly than scary."
"The director seems maybe a little too careful when it comes to putting the truth out there, like he doesn't want to offend anyone. Ironically, the movie is about a musical group that had no problem doing the opposite. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Where once there was cheek and even a little edge, now there's just a desperate giggliness, which even 14-year-old boys would find embarrassing."
"It's a high-wire storytelling act that's difficult to imagine any director executing appropriately, and Clooney doesn't come remotely close to nailing it."
"In despair at a rock club, San Bao tries to eat a drinking glass. Later, in his hospital room, his bandaged mouth becomes a nice visual metaphor for the silencing of the unmonied, the voicelessness of the dispossessed."
A few good action sequences don't make up for the over-the-top morality plea and sheer lunacy of a plot.
...good intentions don't automatically make for good movies.
Too often the filmmakers go for cheap shots.
Forget the hand-holding tweens in the audience - Twilight itself could use a chaperone.
"Mike Cahill's movie never makes much sense and winds up as a ragged, lunging attempt to engage questions about the nature of reality and meaning that have been better addressed in other movies."
"Engaging, intelligent, but direction doesn't quite live up to a first-rate cast."
"Not wrong-headed, and at times not-half-bad."
"Flat, boring, the antithesis of a thriller, the fascinating story of WikiLeaks is a letdown. Even Benedict Cumberbatch's show-stopping octopus dance - which will surely be the rage at all the hottest clubs - can't breathe life into The Fifth Estate"
"The news footage, so powerful on its own, needs no enhancement. The dramatized scenes only slow the film's momentum."
"I'd call The Ice Age Advenures of Buck Wild a bottom-of-the-barrel family film, but the last few Ice Age sequels were bottom-of-the-barrel. This one is the sludge underneath the barrel."

"Obsessed fans, you've won no converts."

&apos;Emancipation&apos; is neither pacey nor interesting enough to be a good action movie&#44; it does have anything new to say about the nature of slavery and&#44; well&#44; emancipation&#44; to be a good slave drama&#46;
"Justin Timberlake and Ben Affleck give their best poker faces but ultimately fail to convince you to gamble your cash away on this limp, unoriginal story of a man out of his depth."
"Though Minghella is a fine actor, there's not a lot he can do with what is essentially a stick figure."
Broad stereotypes engaged in shallow versions of complex issues.
Silly but not-nearly-campy-enough.
"As well-intentioned as the film's messages of respect for the sacrifices of the fallen are, The Last Full Measure succumbs to melodrama at almost every turn."
Struggles to allow the cops to have some perspective in a forgettable thriller that is somehow both bloated and empty at the same time. (It's baffling how this is not a January or February release.)
The lack of real wit in this became a bit tedious.
"A film so heroically unoriginal, it verges on a parody of the genre."
Fun for a while but increasingly tedious...
"It's hard to take any of this nonsense seriously. And if you did, you'd start wondering about the message."

"If you liked the stage version, you'll LOVE this version."
Seeing brilliant actors participate in poorly written movies is never a fun way to spend an afternoon.
"Not only is it not funny and not particularly romantic, it treats women like idiots."
"Despite its rich true-life premise, Dan Friedkin's directorial debut scans like an episode of Law and Order: uneven and predictable."
The Sea of Trees is an emotionally inauthentic and narratively confounding mess that fails to ring a true moment despite the prestigious team behind it
"Flat-pack acting, frat-boy screenwriting (the portrayal of activists is spitefully dumb) and retro gore combine with smug throwback neocolonialist racism and unfunny jokes about diarrhoea, dope and Scooby-Doo."
Logic and proportion have seldom fallen so shruggingly dead
"Singh's aesthetic is like a pungent flavor or a fragrance that lingers in the film's Escher-like folds, overwhelming logical narrative and emotional clarity."
"For those of us who fondly recall the risk-taker who gave us Raw and 48 HRS. and Trading Places, it's hard to stomach Daddy Day Care's vanilla pudding."
"For a film dealing with supernatural phenomena, The Old Guard is unusually dull and prosaic."
"The whole thing feels a bit smug and complacent, as if having a worthwhile subject were the only requirement for making a worthwhile film, and Apted directs in a respectable ""Masterpiece Theatre"" style that effectively drains away any inherent drama."
"It's a showcase for Vanessa Kirby, as well as the score from Nicholas Britell, but not too much else."
"The closer we get to the actors mouthing their clunky, mock-allegorical dialogue, the phonier they seem."
"Predominantly a failure, and the finger points to Peter Hyams, who helms this monolith with little grace or subtlety."
[Jason] James' assured timing and visual knack almost mask how strained and half-baked the story is.
"If someone isn't even going to bother to tell me a joke, don't expect me to laugh."
"Acaba funcionando mais como atestado do talento de sua protagonista, Marion Cotillard, do que como um tributo digno da magnífica cantora que esta interpreta."
Ewan McGregor's directorial debut doesn't do justice to Philip Roth's great book.
"The film limits itself to a retelling, lined with metaphorical flourishes that enchant but do little subverting."
"The impression is of a provocative logline that Simien never quite figured out how to expand into a satisfying movie; once you get the thrust of the story, it's mostly repetitions on a theme."
You may just zone out in this very ordinary story that has very little to offer adults.
"These characters are all tragically lost, strung up or strung out due to their own personal failures. It's a grim, depressing, worm's eye view of the human race, and it's one that Solondz revels in."
"X-Men 2 remains a decent enough sci-fi effort, which delivers on most of the levels fans could expect. Too bad it's hampered by a plot that wouldn't get green-lit for an average episode of Buffy."
The only one who manages to shine is Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa; the actress - active and sarcastic - moves with determination and willing to destroy this repertoire of clichés seen over and over in action films. [Full review in Spanish]
Disappointing romantic dramas like this are why the August/September period is known as a dumping ground.
"Another lone traveler wanders another post-apocalyptic landscape. This time, he carries a book. Who is this man and what's with the book? If that question is enough to keep you interested for two hours, you're all set."
Too often seems like a slightly silly film about the dangers of being too beautiful.
We finally see the ugliness at the heart of a conservative romance narrative like the Twilight series.
A feel good underdog story combined with a Disney-like family drama that is effective for what it is&#44; but The Phantom of the Open falls a few strokes short of its source&#8217;s potential&#46;&#10;&#10;
"At the end of the day (oops, a rash choice of words), go for the great effects. And stay for the unintended laughs. Though it's for all the wrong reasons, this film is highly entertaining."
Even the funny bits are ruined by overemphasis.
Its funniest [element] is the framing issues caused by the height disparity between its stars.
"Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner play Sandler's parents, and they redeem what they can of Click, although no one could salvage the ruthlessly sentimental later passages."
"Despite the provocative title, Steven Soderbergh's $2 million spiritual follow-up to Sex, Lies, and Videotape falls short of arousing much of anything."
"It would seem that almost anybody could have written a more exciting and plausible story on the subject after standing for half an hour outside Trinity Church, watching the passing throng of brokers, bankers, investors and stenographers."
"There's very little that is natural about the storytelling in this crudely conceived, genetically engineered monster of a narrative. And there is no insight into motherhood that you couldn't find in a pound shop greeting card."
The confused climax is a masterclass in poor direction.
"Fortunately for [Redford], Lions for Lambs is a less ham-handed effort than Sayles' Silver City, but it's a near thing."
"A ""Saw"" like murder-puzzle thriller that hits enough of its marks to earn a ""not half bad"" label."
The movie settles into a generic soap opera broken up with enough fancy effects shots to cut a nifty trailer.
The first Taken was a gem. Its second sequel is an insult.
"There are fleeting moments of poignancy and poetry, significantly when the script features narration taken almost directly from the novel, but this is clunkily written and poorly edited."
While many viewers may be absorbed by its down and dirty&#44; stressful &quot;Safdie&quot; vibes&#44; &quot;Funny Pages&quot; is just a hair too off-putting to enjoy&#46;
Greed and jealousy are the key elements of this dramatic misfire from Suzanne Bier in which even the power (re)pairing of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence fails to ignite our interest.
"Slickly sanitized, Destin Daniel Cretton's screen adaptation of Jeanette Walls' candid memoir succumbs to sentimentality."
Uncomfortably straddles the line between revival and send-up...[Nancy Drew] probably should have been kept in mothballs.
Church is a comic marvel..But the film ultimately succumbs to both obvious plotting and the law of diminishing returns.
... a movie whose ho is exceeded only by its hum.
"Any attempt to create a magical fun adventure instead falls flat, ultimately turning into a convoluted mess that barely registers once the end credits roll."
"I felt positive and genial while watching it, but I didn't break out in paroxysms of laughter. It's the kind of amusing film you can wait to see on DVD. I wonder if it will come out on VHS?"
The restaging adds little to our understanding of this story.
You can positively smell the filmmakers' misguidedly intent resolution to turn this flick into something that will appeal to 12-year-old boys as well as its targeted chicks.
"A depressing, trite and mawkishly Hollywood story about the death of a creepy old man and its effect on his spoiled grown-up daughters."
The Showgirls of post-Scream slasher movies: it's not campy nor emotionally involving enough to be more than the sum of its ungainly parts.
The story leaves most of its most potentially interesting ideas on the table.
"Moody, slow-moving and existential, The Green Knight is gorgeous but dense -- what you might get if Terrence Malick decided to make a Knights of the Round Table movie."
"""Oldboy"" director Park Chan-wook's first American movie is so bad I wonder whether his other movies were ever good."
"It's all rather exhausting, as opposed to exhilarating."

"Terrible, just terrible."
It's hard to muster up fear for the end of the civilization when the whole production looks like an hour of network filler.
"I would never sit through it again, but for those of you who want to see every movie nominated for an Academy Award, you'd might as well go ahead and see this one now."
The film is a reminder why romantic comedies have died off so much in recent years.
"When critics bemoan the dumbing down of movies, they're talking about stuff like The Purge."
"Much of this material seems funnier in concept than execution, turning into a collection of throwaway gags and otherwise bizarre detours to pad the abbreviated running time."
"It's often a challenge to figure out exactly what Triple 9 is, a problem exacerbated by a script that packs in far too much plot and not nearly enough guidance in figuring it out."
The Witches of Eastwick shows it's possible to make a commercial entertainment that's bizarre as hell and still not take any chances. 
little more than a primitive form of soap opera
"Tired 007 effort has ridiculous plot, iffy behavior."
"The design and effects teams have lent scale and impact to the futuristic locations and sets. If only Duguay's flashy, aimless direction had succeeded in filling these barren wastes and antiseptic interiors with something resembling human life."
"Muddled, simplistic, highly derivative thriller that's filled with techno-babble and turns out to be terminally boring."
"Like too many big-screen treatments of best-selling dystopian novels, you half-watch it while thinking about when fall TV comes back and what to eat for dinner."
"Another ""primitive"" postwar antique repurposed for boutique sale."
"The Front Runner remains something of an enigma. In the quest to retain the humanity of the characters on all sides of the conflict, Reitman ends up with a film that's not just dramatically inert, but is unclear about what it wants to say."
"As ponderous and cliché-ridden as its predecessors, [Blood Wars] is weighted down by an abundance of dull dialogue, tacky effects and murky cinematography."
"The House On Haunted Hill is a meandering mess of stuck-together scare tactics, none of which works."
Vice has the bargain-basement production values and indifferently plotted narrative of one of those cheesy Z-grade pictures that clutter up cable networks after the clock strikes midnight.
This film is perfect as an example of how Hollywood makes remakes taking all the substance that made the original film great in the first place. [Full review in Spanish]
"Slattery is more adept at conjuring an authentic, sympathetic milieu in support of his large, talented ensemble than he is at ensuring the plot mechanics don't creak."
"something more is needed than a thumbed nose at convention to make a work dazzle and RENT, the movie, doesn't dazzle, in fact it's barely able to stifle a yawn"
The laughter is intermittent and is ultimately overwhelmed by a wave of sentimentality.
"""Hold on!"", says everyone to everyone, which goes more or less without saying. ""I've never seen anything like this!"", they also repeat ad nauseam. You may be tempted to disagree."
Edmond is for hard-core David Mamet fans only.
"Little more than a logic-starved, cable-ready potboiler - a depiction of misogynist fury that's unpleasant in the extreme."
"An extremely rare case of a pic version both written and directed by the book's original author, ""The World Unseen"" reps a strong argument for leaving screen adaptations to other, more capable hands."
"Utterly untroubled by any expectation to entertain - or even mildly engage - the audience, Hillcoat and screenwriter Nick Cave take a stroll through 1930s Virginia with the enthusiasm of beleaguered berry-pickers rather than raucous bootleggers."
Anyone who knows working musicians will be turned off by the spectacle of such self-defeating behavior. No professional musician would act like this.
"Watching the passionless Phantom, with its geriatric story-framing device, gooey dimestore romanticism and tawdry pop ballads about unrequited yearning, feels akin to dying and waking up in your parents' easy-listening-radio hell."
It's difficult to forgive a film which demonises the Chicago's black and Hispanic population in order to allow a wealthy white guy to summarily execute them.
A shallow and somewhat spiritless picture.
"Too polished and professionally by-the-numbers to represent rock bottom in the battle of the sexes genre, but with material this mundane it's hard not to wish someone would've put up a better fight."
The Little Hours has one of the worst laughs-per-minute-per-genius-comic-actor ratios I've ever experienced in my filmgoing life.
Jobs' remarkable life and persistently prickly personality are simply too complicated and his roller-coaster ride to the top of the personal-computing business is simply too crammed with improbable side trips and switchbacks to distill into 128 minutes.
"Frustratingly, potential is all Derrickson’s movie has, as it’s stymied by poor scripting and awkward execution."
"The plot trudges from A to B with zero surprises, while the excitement goes from the middling to the mind-numbing."
...suffers from an uneven and increasingly oppressive structure that ultimately negates the film's few positive attributes...
"Lawrence is excellent in a flawed production, showing all of the strength, vulnerability and emotional range we have come to expect from the star... But daring women like Joy deserve better treatment than this."
It's just so Disney. It could make you very cross.
An interracial social comedy that explores new ground but unfortunately with old cliches.
"The song [Pop! Goes My Heart] is a lot of fun, but ends up being the only memorable thing in a middling rom-com that needed a wittier script."
&quot;I definitely need more action and I think the action in the beginning with Young Diana was so good&#46; But overall I definitely think it has those Wonder Woman lessons that we all enjoy about the character in general&#46;&quot;
There's hardly an area in which Hot Pursuit is not found lacking.
"Writer Peter Steinfeld and director F. Gary Gray have created a pale, blurry copy of the first picture, peopled with supporting characters who amount to nothing and a choppy scenario that drags on 20 minutes too long."
"I think the movie did a good job informing me... However, it can seriously drag and a choice to involve interpretative dance did not work at all."
"Needs more information and more stunning images that speak for themselves, not another earnest monologue from Captain Obvious."
Office Christmas Party is a waste of your time and mine.
"Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, and a prestige piece is just a well-intentioned bore."
The skirmishes and eventual full-blown battle is garden-variety PG-13 violence - clanking swords and grunting - so the action won't past muster for a generation weaned on The Walking Dead.
Playi[s] like a cross between Galaxy Quest and Sky High but without the wit and cleverness of either film...
Credit director Tarsem Singh with the flickers of originality you'll find.
This slim if mildly compelling film lands somewhere between character sketch and morality tale.
"Though Nick Hamm directs with zest, the script by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, adapting rock critic Neil McCormick's autobiography, is low on laughs."
"George Lucas' 1977 original A New Hope was hokey and badly written but had a kind of seat-of-the-pants magic about it. It also had soul, something this film utterly lacks."
The writing in Wrath of Man isn't just bad. It's your-co-worker-signed-up-for-a-weekend-drama-workshop bad.
"If you're only seeing it because your Stomp the Yard DVD broke, you'll still be disappointed."
The Hummingbird Project asks the question but never gives a satisfying answer.
"""Citadel"" attempts to transform mundane anxieties into the stuff of a horror film. But the initial tension of the premise dissipates like a slow leak."
"Hernndez certainly deserves kudos for making such a good-looking film for no money, but budget limitations are no excuse for sloppy, nonsensical writing."
"It is an overblown, histrionic, cluttered and a nowhere near well enough developed mess, the erstwhile humanitarian a one-note caricature I knew little more about at the end than I did at the beginning."
"Lucky Number Slevin can't boast of a single interesting or novel idea, but it did hold my attention throughout ..."
"Greenfield has shaped the new film into a self-analytical retrospective... Greenfield does, however, seem cognisant of her own wounds. It's just that they're not terribly compelling in the form in which she dramatises them here."
"The film falls into every trap of literary adaptation. It's rushed, superficial, unmoving, full of characters explaining the plot to one another."
Most of the script consists of speeches explaining too many intricate rules of supernatural battles between good and evil. Even the cast seems bored.
"As ponderous and cliché-ridden as its predecessors, [Blood Wars] is weighted down by an abundance of dull dialogue, tacky effects and murky cinematography."
Everyone involved needs to sit quietly and think about what they've done.
"Instead of skipping along, the movie plods: instead of opening up these people, it pins them under glass and watches emptily as they wriggle."
"Enormous goings on keep going on, and on, in ""X-Men: Apocalypse,"" a collection of explosions, eruptions and conflagrations that suggests the implosion of a franchise."
If you want to sit back and watch a Guy Ritchie action spy comedy that also stars Hugh Grant&#44; just watch &#8220;The Man from U&#46;N&#46;C&#46;L&#46;E&#46;&#8221;
Bewitched is a poorly executed mess that no wiggle of the nose can save.
"Near the end ... someone suggests a life filled with trouble and burden, and that might have been a story worth telling."
So busy bowing in the direction of Woody Allen and Wes Anderson that it never gets around to telling much of a story.
"“The Whale” is laughably earnest, larded with melodrama, and designed to shut down the long-standing association of human bulk with high spirits."
There is&#44; in the end&#44; a lot to like and enjoy contained within The Trust&#44; but it&apos;s predominantly outweighed &#40;and essentially negated&#41; by an unfocused narrative that grows more and more tiresome as it progresses&#46;
Okja is a classic case of a film that you emerge from not knowing quite who it's intended for.
"Not a travesty, some small ones may find delight with the cute hedgehogs and company, but it is lazy."
I wish there were more of the human element in Human Nature.
"While the four leading ladies can easily prove they've still got it, this movie does not render elder hotness into an award-worthy rom-com."
Without Remorse is another non-starter Tom Clancy project with only the lead actor taking the assignment seriously while everyone else falters.
The Hateful Eight often feels more like a sadistic stage play than a movie. [Full review in Japanese]
It is a bland attempt of supernatural horror that becomes more and more embarrassing in every imaginable aspect. [Full review in Spanish]
"Unable or unwilling to find unconventional means to tell a very odd story, the filmmakers hack up the book's narrative into slick and simple building blocks, then mortar them together piece by piece."
"""Alright Now"" is actually not alright. It lost my attention very quickly until the last third of the film."
"It's all a saggy, inept mess."
...this might be appropriate for an evening at home on Blu-ray.
"This awkward hybrid of two popular film genres is to the art of moviemaking what Ali's famous ""rope-a-dope"" technique was to boxing."
"Vince Vaughn simply does not convey Norman's inner madness with Anthony Perkins's elan, nor can Viggo Mortensen, who comes across as somehow eccentric, match the undeviating John Gavin in the 1960 work."
It's hard to believe you'd be squinting at your watch in the dark while two of the most charismatic actors in Hollywood are on the screen in front of you.
"What it needs is writing worthy of Brydon's talents, giving the main attraction a cinematic playground to explore, not a yellow line of cliché to follow."
"""Redemption"" doesn't have the chutzpah to let loose and be as dumb as it needs to be, so it instead bores the audience comatose with long stretches of sad-face Statham putzing around an apartment to justify the too-brief bursts of giddy bone-breaking."
Macy has played this kind of lovable-loser character so many times that he seems to be coasting.
"The town nutcase, the bible-thumping Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden, over-acting yet again), is so convincing that one of the crowd commits suicide, and another, the store's butcher, stabs one of the good guys --- (""Clean up in Aisle Three!"")"
"From the evidence here, Walker's forte may have been not action but stillness-a knack for embodying ordinary Joes without any fussiness."
"Not scary, and not even particularly funny."
"This is eminently missable, though the mosaic design of Asgard, Thor's mythical realm, is pretty cool."
"Things were not looking good before then, but after an unforgivable bit of deception, Joe Bell reveals itself to be nothing more than a shameless, pandering 'departure' vehicle for the wrong star."
"...the whole film feels like there's something a bit off, which is all the more annoying since there is so much that is good about it."
"With potential at the start, its a shame the film doesn't hold up what it promises."
The sequel to Dr. Dolittle repeats the mistake of the first one.
"While this is more smoothly realized than Romero's choppy original, it's also been streamlined for mass consumption, removing all thorny sociopolitical subtext, avoiding the '73 model's cruelly ironic conclusion, and throwing in far too many cheap scares."
This is 40 minutes too long.
"Like many of the musical artists whose songs are covered, the series has suffered a slump with its second outing. ""Pitch Perfect 2"" plays the notes, but not the music."
A Love Song for Bobby Long travels all the worn-out roads.
"Intentionally or not, Nicola Collins's filmed interviews with various old-school East End geezers give us a fair idea of their sentimentality, paranoia, smugness and flashes of humour."
152 minutes is an awful lot of this.
"In short, this isn't reinventing the comedy (or even the ""Adam Sandler comedy,"" for that matter)."
"""Fist Fight"" is the result of a script by two first-time feature writers and it shows. Jokes, or what are supposed to be jokes, flow quickly and some hit their mark"
"There have been plenty of movies about British kids, old-timey England, and quirky nannies. Please, just make a new movie."
"The soundtrack here is piercingly awful, the gymnastics routines hold little suspense, and after a while I just wanted Socrates to give it a rest."
"Let's Be Cops, a dull, lame, sexist and predictable 'comedy' ticking the wrong boxes."
The set-up is simple enough at best. The execution is simple-minded at worst.
Friendsgiving is just a messy exercise of extraneous excess.
"Though not a terrible film, Insidious: The Last Key fails to live up to the franchise's high standards."
"Ticket to Paradise never takes flight or break through the already lowered threshold [of the genre], because the script and Parker's direction is too basic, superficial, and obvious. [Full review in Spanish]"
The movie indulges in a rather stale flashback procedure.
"It was fun while it lasted. Still, it might be time to start wondering if the McConaissance is finally over."
"Everything about ""Suicide Squad"" from the title on down promises overkill. And the movie, to its ultimate discredit, delivers."
Moralising anti-porn tract rather than ambiguous life story of a true enigma.
Takes on the topic of gender dysphoria with a talented cast but not much to say.
"The script fails to come up with a convincing reason for the mirrors behaving as nastily as they do, and the final twist is effective only if you don't, as it were, reflect upon it."
"Much like the first movie, The Purge: Anarchy sets up a surprisingly interesting scenario and world, but simply bungles its execution."
It doesn't have that extra spark required to make it anything but instantly forgettable.
It was a dark and stormy night...
"A rancid, unwatchable load, devoid of mirth and joy, and an enemy to all that is good."
"Frozen within the strictures of their shallowly conceived characters, Gadon and Powley do as best they can portraying those two semi-beautiful Windsor daughters."
"When the script is not being stunningly predictable it is plain old unconvincing, with twists that will make your head spin."
"The point is to show the misery of a underprivileged woman ahead of her time, but so much dedication for such a small payoff makes you wonder why."
"It's a mopey, silly situation, whose only tension comes from our perpetual fear that Levinson is about to make us watch a somber drama copulating with a farce."
"A stilted, utterly phony drama of rich-kid angst that thinks it's saying something about the hidden perils of privilege but is actually just an exercise in wheel-spinning inanity."
Imagine the film First Man if it neglected to include the moon landing. Pollock without painting. Or The Queen's Gambit if they'd decided not to show any chess.
"There's a reason the studio didn't offer an advance screening. ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" is a big time stinker."
The jokes in Scary Movie do everything to signal their arrival except call ahead and book a hotel room.
The film is uninspired compared to its source material and entirely too predictable&#46;
"Aniston and Sandler have a goofy, relaxed rapport that is often amusing despite the film's best efforts to smother any sign of verve."
If this is a movie for children than I can only guess the filmmakers had Donald Rumsfeld's grandkids in mind when they made it
"Bolting together a fish-out-of-water story and a victory-of-the-underdog yarn, Fisherman's Friends delivers on neither front."
"It's easy to see what drew these filmmakers to the beautifully written essay, which had broken hearts and wounded families built into it. What's harder to grasp is how they could turn it into something so pedestrian."
The characters' nonexistent personalities mean that there's not much spark between them.
Could you please create a lead villain whose best move doesn't involve flying bed sheets?
You Should Have Left is a forgettable entry in the haunted house genre. A good Kevin Bacon can't save a lackluster script.
A gravely unfunny motion picture of the sort that supposes that people screaming invective at each other is close enough to count as a joke.
There's no spark in the romance because people in romantic comedies are simply not allowed to be people anymore: they're hair and outfits inside a premise.
What have we done to deserve another found-footage movie?
"Feels sort of like a drunk, racist dad's take on 'The Big Lebowski,' which is often terrible but occasionally surreal."
This is by far the worst film in the series and the 3D is a complete waste of money.
"Readers will at least understand why this story exists in the first place. But even in the more successful first half of the movie, there are signs that Linklater has failed to crack the work as a whole."
"Exhausted is how many audiences members will feel after squirming through such a repetitive, one-joke comedy."
"The biggest disappointment is its mediocrity, as it could have been the ultimate dark retelling of the classic fairy tale."

I wouldn't want to imagine Greek without Brand
"[Plummer] is incapable of mediocrity, but damn if the script doesn't draw him close to the edge."
"A clunky, forced romantic comedy of mistaken identity that might as well have been called While You Were Dead."
Go see something else.
"Not just bad, but it's offensively boring, and tedious."
"A film that tries to convey a palpable sense of epic adventure and maximum exploitation of violence and sex, but which ultimately feels as relevant and important as a short film directed, written and starring cats and dogs. [Full review in Spanish]"
It's not that Gods and Generals is almost four hours long. It's that it's four hours of bad.
"I understand the need to set up a franchise, but 'The Darkest Minds' ends without fleshing out any of its ideas. Grade: Incomplete."
"The film's a haul but it's imaginative and rarely dull, especially once you realize how far it has strayed in principle from its source."
A frustrating film which is full of good intentions but is marred by sloppy execution.
"If you overlook the f-bombs and the drug deals, Hustle & Flow is peddling the same easy-path-to-riches-and-romance story Danielle Steel keeps cranking out."
"Soldier is so mediocre, it might have been more mindless fun if it had been even worse."
"Primitive, overlong and not-very-funny satire of one ""wronged"" woman in conflict with the Chinese justice system."
"To describe ""Just Go With It"" as another failed romantic comedy would imply that at one time it wanted to succeed as romantic comedy."
"Dark Waters takes place over an extensive span of time, but its exploration of its central characters is far more shallow."
As the film tries to ratchet up the tension&#44; character development takes a backseat to narrative gimmicks and ridiculous twists&#46;
"I guess I was expecting too much of the old television show in this movie, and it didn't deliver any of that. They didn't even use the theme song, for crying out loud."
"If Ghibli wanted to make their own mockbuster, then they pulled it off."
"The screenplay, work by five writers, based on a story by three others, seems to have been rewritten often enough that any individuality has been lost."
"Watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives. As your relatives swap one mundane story after another, you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart."
Anyone can trace a Picasso.
All but the most die-hard fans can agree that the Twilight movies are spoof-worthy. So it's too bad they don't get a worthy spoof.
The overall effect is a solid one-hour love story followed by a dramatized Wikipedia entry.
"A freak show whose alternately compelling and repulsive heroine can't disguise the fact that it's a movie by a sour old guy who no longer likes anything or anyone and who also, more damningly, just isn't interested."
"This sci-fi film noir craves a passionate center, an intoxicating core or some pulse that makes us want to keep taking that first step into dark waters, but it leaves us drowning in its quiet tedium instead."
"By the time a herd of Godzilla-sized hogs - the Aurochs - arrive on the scene, it might as well be a Cajun-styled Cloverfield."
Never achieves liftoff.
In The Burning Plain we follow three-or maybe four-different stories that ultimately converge in ways that are both utterly predictable and completely preposterous.
"A pretty well-written acting exercise that has the misfortune of, more often than not, looking as seasick as Battlefield Earth."
"But while the cast is great, the milieu is vivid, the images are polished and the atmosphere is effectively moody, ""Things Heard & Seen"" fails to connect on a visceral level."
"The real man-made monster in I, Frankenstein is the film itself, a ridiculous good-versus-evil story enrobed in a pastiche of religious symbolism and stodgy mythology and set in a world created in a computer special effects lab."
Sexy but pretentious melodrama.
The greatest puzzle surrounding Tom Hanks' latest foray into Dan Brown territory is just how these films continue to get made.
"Truth or Dare was an interesting premise with a ridiculous script. If it committed to its ridiculousness, it would've worked...it never found its footing."
"We Are Marshall is never as emotionally draining as this material requires, but it gives it the old college try and comes close to succeeding."
"The brothers prove they can play it straight, but they're preferred, for better and worse, at a sharp angle."
"The baseball fan in me was let down... and I wanted a better, funnier, love story. In other words, they swung for the fences, but just managed a blooper over the infield."
"Though director Ray provides a few choice moments of psychological tension, nothing in his film can hope to outpace the anxiety caused by the appearance of former Attorney General John Ashcroft in its opening scene."
Witherspoon... does the best she can with her unforgiving role... but no one could get us honestly past the notion that we're meant to take all these characters as delightfully oddball when they are quite clearly pathological.
The Ice Road sinks before gaining any momentum whatsoever
xXx: Return of Xander Cage feels like a cynical miscalculation by Diesel to rip off his other franchise. The problem wasn't that Xander operated solo; the problem was Diesel and his monumental effort to be cool instead of endearing.
Maybe the screenwriters were chemically altered when they decided that this stoner comedy was funny.
Zemeckis has aimed high but on this occasion the documentary reality of Man on Wire trumps the wonder of Hollywood artifice.
"Throws bits of information at random, like an exotic pet chucking you-know-what."
"Ultimately, it's just another by-the-numbers Disney flick."
"Kline and Smith have some nice moments together, even if the transition from breezy comedy into more serious drama is clumsy."
"There wasn't really anywhere for the story to go after 2008's surprise hit Taken, and this movie quickly proves that. Not only does it have that same appalling moral vacuum at the centre, but the plot becomes increasingly absurd as it progresses."
"Suffering from a vague script, vague performances, and even vaguer mise-en-scne, Lars von Trier's ""Melancholia"" achieves a strange momentum towards the abstraction of scattershot filmmaking reminiscent...of his Dogme days."
"In her raw, ruff-and-ready style, Hardwicke gets in your face early and often. You just want to tell her, 'Down, girl.'"
"There are plenty of enjoyable moments, but it just never becomes as scary or fresh as you expect. Fun and creepy moments balance out painfully mediocre and cliche threads that bind the stories together."
Made me car sick.
"I gotta say, though, that for as long as they've been waiting, women deserve better than middling, pandering stuff like Captain Marvel and now Birds Of Prey."
The film starts just fine but it slowly becomes predictable until we get to an ending that doesn't really do anything to help the movie. [Full review in Spanish]
"[P]icking and choosing the worthwhile moments out of this disorganized grab bag of tones, gags, and ideas feels like picking through a cheap assortment of mixed nuts, looking for the occasional pecan among peanuts."
Lacks the depth and drama of the source material.
"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice isn't in any way a perfect comic book movie, but it has enough going for it that will make fans happy."
"The film held me a fair way in, because it's well paced and the actors are competent. But finally, the plot took one or two big twists too far."
"Culturally derivative, structurally bland and almost meaningless."
"This is a big, loud, commercial picture which does not appear to have been written so much as audience-tested, global-market-researched, greenscreened and CGI-ed to within an inch of its life."
"It's not for all tastes (certainly not mine), but for those who find such raunchy comedies funny this one is at least well-executed."
"A laughable -- or rather, unlaughable -- excuse for a film."
"It's just unfortunate that the film doesn't give [Willis] that much to actually do, at least until the ridiculous climax, when video-game director Siri goes all out with slow-mo, pseudo-religious imagery and lots of impressive fire effects."
"It's grave, lumbering, arrhythmic, and bloated, an emotional hogwallow of catchpenny insights and easy sentimentality."
"This isn't Taken, unless that's how you feel after forking over $10 bucks to see this thing."
Those Who Wish Me Dead could have risen to meet Jolie's ability. But the film reflects the industry's lack of imagination for an older female action star.
Mona Lisa and the Blood Moon leaves too many questions unanswered&#46; A rocking soundtrack thunders while a mystery doesn&apos;t unfurl&#46; There&apos;s pulp entertainment galore but little understanding of the protagonist&#46; 
It finally offers little more than a moderately engaging slice of contemporary aboriginal life that mostly fails to dig beneath the surface of this underrepresented world.
This family drama... tries so hard to be warm and uplifting that you keep rooting for it to be better than it is.
"In the process of enlightening the masses on the hipster party scene, Mr. Harrison forgot to make an interesting movie."
"The film makers had declared they were bravely exploring new levels of licentiousness, but the biggest risk they've taken here is in making a nearly $40 million movie without anyone who can act."
"'Hero' could have been a landmark film; as is, it is nothing more than a lot of pretty pictures in the service of a storyline far too muddled for its own good"
"While the premise is quite promising, the dead hand of Valentines Day co-writers Abby Kohn and Marc Silberstein supplant the human interest potential with a mawkish rom-com sensibility."
After awhile all the film's elaborate charms begin to feel as empty as a Disneyfied fairy tale.
"[Howard] gives the fire fighting scenes a satisfying feel of terror. But the psychological portraits of the fire fighters and the arson mystery that dominate the film are flimsy, like an art student's dutifully crafted reproductions of the great masters."
"The Wolverine does hold great potential, but its best elements are underdeveloped."
What passes for narrative requires manufacturing an antagonist whose motivations never make sense and whose very existence disregards the absurd yet otherwise continuous rules defining Emmet's universe.
"Truly awful. Except for a slightly humorous bare two minute stretch in the middle depicting a mediation scene, one waits in vain for something, anything, to appreciate and/or entertain."
"Wrath of Man is a shallow, surface-deep actioner that works as neither a standalone Statham film nor an ensemble crime film ..."
"...had the script been any good, Nicholson would have been the perfect choice to play a ""civilized"" man wrestling with the beast within."
"The film borrows lavishly from Oliver Stone's oeuvre, only it borrows the wrong things."
"Whenever you agree that there's more credibility in spotting a flying donkey with the hiccups rather than believing in an effective Madonna-hired acting coach, then you definitely earned the license to go with your first instinct."
"Alpha and Omega, an unambitious 3-D animation about a couple of young wolves in love, isn't so much howlingly bad as it is howlingly boring."
Incoherently directed&#44; thematically muddled&#44; and poorly acted&#44; writer&#47;director&#47;producer&#47;star Livia De Paolis&#8217; drama The Lost Girls should have stayed on the page&#46; 
The two main characters aren't very likeable and their relationship dynamics feel contrived.
Winds up being a stylish soap opera more 'lit' than enlightening.
"There's plenty of muscle in Nick Love's bloody, boys' own adventure, but not much suspense and next to no logic."
"Starts off great with solid humor but somewhere along the line it becomes stale, repetitive and annoying. Batman isn't some emo, wannabe beat boxer who is in love with Barbara Gordon."
"From its contrived structure to its forced speechifying, this story... never acquires the emotional potency or coherence its themes demand."
"It's a showcase leading role for Parker Posey, who obviously has the stuff, and generates wacky charm. But the movie never pulls itself together."
Collapses into a flabby heap of tepid French farce.
"""F9"" is so ridiculously complicated, and so completely uninterested in showing how its cast gets from one place to another, that I lost track of where the climactic car chase was set."
"It leaves much to be desired in the end as it becomes a slog and seems it no longer knows what to do with itself about halfway through. The intrigue and fight for survival dissipate quite quickly, which results in a pretty disappointing ending."
"As talented as they may be physically, Bracey and Ramirez are no onscreen match for Reeves and Swayze, and the plot and dialogue aren't helping."
"There is much in this film to admire, but it goes by too fast and the story is almost incomprehensible. There is certainly enchantment here, but the story does not do much to hold it together."
"This is a boys' movie, a cinematic video game, full of sound and fury, but in the end amounting to disappointingly little."
Whoever taught Mandy how to deal should have advised her to fold while she had the chance.

"It's all very silly and contrived, but it's also airy and agreeably laid-back, not unlike a decent vacation."
"Too bad the film never quite gets the blood pumping in the viewer, which may be a failure of Park's to define his audience."
The respective charms of Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant have worn threadbare.
Mr Malcolm&#8217;s List is a film we&#8217;ve seen countless times before&#46; If the idea of the routine premise doesn&#8217;t already have viewers swooning&#44; it&#8217;s unlikely they&#8217;ll find any pleasure in being acquainted with this loveless romance&#46;
"Autmata's generic urban 2044 dystopia is a realm of hazily gray CGI buildings, many rubble-strewn and abandoned."
"Pretty much a mess--a woozy, sometimes inspired but mostly infuriating piece far more interested in conveying mood than information."

The familiar premise and awkward nonlinear structure are enlivened somewhat by intriguing character dynamics and Ryder&#8217;s committed performance&#46;
Dry rehashed depressing material coiffed in a couple of solid performances from Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie...
'Hillbilly Elegy' is so misguidedly focused on painting its portrait of poverty porn that it forgets to add any substance or depth to a flat narrative that leaves the faintest of impressions.
While its blood-splattered&#44; patriarchy-pounding energy carries &#8220;The Princess&#8221; for a while&#44; its barebones story eventually runs out of gas&#46; So it ends up hinging on the combat which ranges from occasionally electric to flat-out goofy&#46;
"It has a rather dull premise, with a focus on tulip economics in the 17th century. "
"Sex comedies work best with light touch, and as the ponderous title (a literal translation of the French term for orgasm) indicates, Australian writer-director Josh Lawson mostly doesn't have it."

"Fortunately, when America's love affair with Eric Schaeffer finally kicks in, there will be a fat back-catalog of little-seen Eric Schaeffer projects ready to be discovered."
"While this is Kawase's most straightforward, accessible movie, it's also perhaps her dullest, sustaining a single maudlin note for nearly two hours."
"The topical nightmare has potential to get under your skin, but relies too much on familiar jump scares and easy violence."
I spied with my little eye...a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits

Hard time in the joint can change a person. Make them worse sometimes. And it would appear that this is Hilton's idea of revenge on a world she feels has done her wrong.
The goofiest plundering of the Bible since Christopher Walkin's 'Prophecy' pictures...a combination of horror movie cliche and pseudo-religious mumbo-jumbo that proves a pretty fetid brew.
I had the inescapable feeling that this film ought to come with a warning that it has a lot in common with a NASA wind tunnel.
"Pretty animation, weak jokes and a message that feels downright sinister."
"There's a good thriller to be made one day about the way the Internet both reveals and disguises its users, but this isn't it."
"Without Queen Latifah, Last Holiday would have been a somewhat tedious vacation, despite its beautiful setting."
The voyeurs in the film respond with predictable repulsion and sarcasm to Seidl's lower middle-class cartoons.
"A few good cringe-zingers befit something born from two of the century's greatest comedy writers. But it's sterile in the moments that are satirical or sinister, overstuffed with half-baked ideas, and ultimately confused in its calculus."
Doc's incredible tale of WWII espionage would likely work better as a feature film.
"Even at a brisk 83 minutes the comedy plods around aimlessly for much of its running time, building to a foregone conclusion that I saw coming from a mile away."
The only surprising thing about an action movie filmed entirely with GoPro cameras is why it took so long.

"Where previous Sweeneys have found room in the character for both anguish and exultation amidst all the faraway looks and obsessional glowering, Depp skirts along the edge of the emotional chasm without ever really diving in."
"""How doesn't really matter, does it?"" yells Ed Norton, about half way through this muddled spinoff. I was so relieved, no longer having to sweat the small stuff, like plot."
A film of only very limited charm.
Cannibalizes both the Stax/Motown era of soul music and the shopworn road movie with an equal lack of freshness.
...too weird and too off-the-wall to become anything more than a mildly amusing curiosity.
"Boy, words can not express how much I just loathe and detest this movie."
Not much of it makes sense. The rest isn't terribly interesting.
It's not as bad as it appears to be from the trailers.
"The flashiest, funniest, and most baroque of the ""Vengeance Trilogy."" It is also the most simpleminded and, despite that, eventually the most muddled."
"All the signs leading up to this were dire, but honestly, I tried to like it. I was ready to like it. I pumped myself up for it. No go. Disaster, disaster, disaster. Disaster."
Easily the worst outing in an already mediocre movie series.
A near-claustrophobic comedy that manages to be both predictable and preachy.
"Russell’s showy directorial pizzazz is very much in evidence, but there’s an edge of desperation to the chunks of exposition that dam the flow of this already meandering tale."
"To say the epilogue strains credibility is a kindness. The filmmakers seem set on a happy ending, no matter what the story itself is telling them."
Sex and the City 2 makes Phyllis Schlafly look like Andrea Dworkin.
"There is laziness at every turn -- in the writing, in the acting, in the filmmaking. Don't reward these yahoos."
"Pretty goofy idea, but kids will probably be diverted by it."
It's the same movie except Rose Byrne and Seth Rogen battle a sorority instead of a frat.
"Its watchable, but the by-the-numbers execution leaves Morbius just a bit anemic."
"The film, financed by a Kickstarter campaign, looks polished enough. But its investors' money might have been better spent elsewhere."
"The very picture of noble failure, it's a bright red heart without a beat."
"Westfeldt takes a topic full of complex emotional shadings and turns it into something that is, for the most part, reductive, cliched and even sitcommy."
The cerebral horror of Wendigo and The Last Winter is nowhere to be found in Glenn McQuaid's meandering 19th-century supernatural gothic tale.
It's incomprehensible.
"The best that can be said about Rob Zombie's Halloween remake is that he makes it his own, though the considerable alterations only flatter John Carpenter's 1978 slasher-pic template."
"A tone-deaf motion picture that sours a perfectly ripe opportunity to slap around the world of porn, forgoing satire to make googly eyes with characters unworthy of such warm contemplation."
"Regardless of the importance of the picture, the execution prevents it from being a project that will reach an appropriately wide audience; it's just not that engaging."
You should know not to see a comedy when its premise reveals that the filmmakers can't identify humour.
"A frustratingly incomplete half-measure overall, however understandable the sense that it might've been something more must have felt back in Park City. That final shot, though... damn, that really is something."
Reveals the fundamental silliness of fashion.
The worst part of the martial-arts epic The Forbidden Kingdom [is] a moment near the halfway mark when there arrives a gag that involves Chan getting a face full of urine. This kingdom really should be forbidden.
Pixar is forcing Disney to keep up with more than ongoing distribution negotiations&#59; Brother Bear is proof its muscles are starting to cramp&#46;

"Despite a lovely cameo turn by Burt Lancaster, Field of Dreams is the male weepie at its wussiest."
"Piles revelations upon twists upon double-crosses, but never comes up with anything truly surprising."
"Like vampires, this genre is getting deadly."
Riddled with cliché and trite situations that are very difficult to swallow.
Bullock also covers herself with gratuitous comedy and predictable drama to prevent audiences from seeing the naked truth of addiction.
"Hall Pass, despite its come-ons, is more interested in making men-are-horny-and-incompetent jokes than it is in exploring the myriad complications of its plot device."
"Hirsch never interviews the bullies or their parents, taking necessary steps to drill to the root of the problem. The perspective remains with the victim alone, losing the dimension of the examination."
"Much like an ambitious video-art installation, it's intriguing, inconclusive and not as challenging as it wants to be."
"Ivory without Merchant films a bloodless, dreary tale"
The most sexually explicit legit feature film to come out of 'merry ole' England from a mainstream director.
"Lots of intrigue from the start, only to fall flat in the end. ""The Other Lamb"" fails to seek it's full potential."
"Rejoice and Shout, Don McGlynn's documentary on the history of gospel music, is a film for connoisseurs."
"Horror/thriller about someone or something targeting those who did nothing when they saw a man being badly assaulted. Preachy, yet still muddled about its message."
"Most of the time, it feels like Fuqua is just ticking the boxes of the genre conventions, which would be fine if all he was trying to do is make a run-of-the-mill Western TV movie. But this is The Magnificent Seven for god's sake."
"The title of Scott Coffey's new film is a pretty obvious double entendre, but it does efficiently convey the good intentions behind this scattershot production."
"he vampires and werewolves are at it again. No, Twihards, you haven't missed another ""Twilight"" episode. This is indeed part of a franchise, but a far different, more violent one."
It amounts to much ado about almost nothing. But that may be the result of Elliott's attempt to make it entertaining rather than plausible.
Painful. Our kids deserve better.
"Faced with an unjust world, Closed Circuit waves the white flag."
So Arnold Schwarzenegger has reached the shaky-cam-and-hoodies stage of his career. But it's a bit late in the day for Arnold to try to get all indie and complicated.
"If Farrell's caffeine-crazed commands to his team net a few laughs, the PG rating guarantees a sugar-coated ending at the whistle."
"Reeves plays one of the comic-book world's most intriguing antiheroes in an adaptation that isn't the massive screw-up fans rightfully expected, but has a cool-to-silly ratio that's just barely acceptable."
"What's happened to Burton's gift for storytelling? In the movie's second half, it's impossible to follow the story's gnarled-vine logic."
The movie's computer-generated animation is the best case yet for keeping the process hand-drawn.
Leads to... obvious social metaphors. [Full review in Spanish]
"Carmilla ... becomes a movie somewhat at odds with itself -- wanting to dissect and undermine the established narrative, while still needing to play along with it."
"The resulting caricaturish effect, coupled with a story line that repeats its basics over and over again for more than two hours, damage this potentially droll look at ungoverned urges and tyke tyranny beyond salvaging."
A calamity of miscasting and commercial concessions.
"The two stars may be in love in real life, but they've managed to keep that chemistry well-hidden on screen."
So why does Nim's Island feel so charmless and rote? Perhaps it's because the film feels like an amalgam of other movies' plotlines.
Some movies are on auto-pilot from the get-go. Failure To Launch doesn't even have a pilot.
Armageddon Time embraces liberal guilt and shame but supplies no ideas about what to do with them -- beyond confessing that they are there.
...a great enough idea that it almost doesn't bother me that these stories don't really illuminate one another.
"It's intellectual snack food, satisfying for a little while but always leaving you hungry for more."
"Accompanied by one of the worst scores I've heard in some time, Seven Pounds follows its lead by continually trying to bury its final note under another one and constantly sounding like the composer missing the beat over and over and over again."
"Director Robert Zemeckis hits a new artistic low with Welcome to Marwen, a film that mistakes schmaltz for substance and employs downright boring novelty animation in a hackneyed attempt to stir the emotions."
"Despite having a promising premise, The Curse of La Llorona falls foul of formula and ends up being utterly mediocre - it's frightfully uninteresting."
"Like ""Meet the Parents,"" but littered with F-bombs, ""Why Him?"" is a holiday comedy that never quite figures itself out."
Glum adaptation
"Another dreadfully well-intentioned, insipidly inspirational sports movie from Disney,"
"Dostoevsky's version was better, if not as funny."
Crimson Peak is a classic case of style over substance resulting in a hollow movie experience that never fully reaches its potential.
Ingrid Caven (ex-Fassbinder diva) turns kitchen-sink realism to kitsch and surrealism Europudding-style. Credits reveal that the film had German co-funding. Sometimes money talks and the language is Gobbledegook.
"It doesn't even stink in any meaningful way, completely forgotten before it's even over."
"The only reason I can surmise for the positive reviews The Imitation Game is that it confirms all the ""normal"" audience's worst suspicions about ""genius"" and queer life, without offering any meaningful insight into either."
"Although featuring a splendid Edward Norton performance, 'Rounders' comes across as too unbelievable, often straying beyond the bounds of rationality."
[Lopez] gives the movie a much-needed spark whenever the script starts to stall.
"It seems as if Craig Zobel wants to implicate the audience in these proceedings, but he doesn't have a very clear idea how to go about it."
It's another clone that looks good but has no soul.
I'm starting to suspect that Lee's insight into American thought is only a little deeper than a Western filmmaker who thinks he's brave for still bringing up bound feet.
"Though it does not exactly have wings, View from the Top might be worth a viewing -- particularly when it's next to Sweet Home Alabama on the video rack."
It's got some of the comic-noir-y small town murder plot of 'To Die For' without the payoff. It's got some of the male midlife crisis of 'American Beauty' without the nuance.
"Top Gun's Best of the Best meet 2001's Hal in Rob Cohen's latest sensorial attack, a derivative action-adventure that's basically an ultra-produced videogame"
A cacophony of completely false notes that end in a tear-jerking crescendo.
The Mechanic is revenge served up well enough to blast the winter blues away.
A maddening mishmash of styles and genres with absolutely no dramatic resonance.
"Relegating the film to January and uselessly converting it into ugly, barely-there 3-D so inadequate it might as well be billed as 2 1/4-D, the studio's decisions contradictorily stink of both desperation and defeat."
A biased story of a billion-dollar industry that must have tons of skeletons in its closet. But it didn't even open the closet door.
"By the time Love Wedding Repeat reveals its high-concept set-up, you've either run out of patience at its relative mediocrity, or are too wrapped up in its comedy of errors to care about wonky second-act twists."
"Hey mom, I went to another planet and found money for you to buy back the family farm. Sure, I blew up the planet in the process, but aren't you proud of me?"
"""Bride Flight'' is the sort of old-fashioned women's picture they stopped making around the time Christina Crawford had to put away the wire hangers."
"Lacking the zip and originality of the 2017 original, this animated sequel is more obnoxious than endearing."
The film has a very good cast and it is an interesting story but it does have an odd pace.
This movie is so lazy it might as well star Adam Sandler.
The only scary thing of the film is the poor and obnoxious visual language of it. [Full review in Spanish]
"For nearly its entire length, the movie comes off as condescending, particularly about small towns."
[Edgerton] tries to make almost every single character palatable enough to placate the side they might offend.
"The haphazard nature of the production is more than apparent. It's so rushed together that parts of the dialogue jump, lacking cohesion, and the plot jumps too."
"[Singh] sketches his central characters thinly, and he ends the film on a slightly confusing note."
"This thriller is built entirely around a twist ending, but the scenes leading up to it aren't intriguing or suspenseful; rather, they're aggravating and nonsensical, and the ending feels unearned."
This hammer-home-the-message female empowerment triptych takes bite-sized epiphanies and blows them up into thirty-minute Sundance Channel confections.
"Everyone tries hard, but Leap Year shows talent cant redeem a truly uninspired script. For committed rom-com fans only."
"""Jamie Marks Is Dead"" admirably refuses to hew to conventional horror tropes and is acted with integrity by its young performers, but the film nonetheless has a nagging pulse problem."
"""Hoodwinked Too,"" which runs an eternity-risking 85 minutes, plays like a jaded rehash of other pictures. And none of those other pictures, sadly, is the original ""Hoodwinked."""
"As a horror movie, Master doesn't quite carry the torch all the way to the finish line, barreling along like a truncated first season of your next Netflix binge."
"Do you find insults revolving around the words Marky Mark, churros and/or #YOLO hilarious? How about the notion of a dorky white kid flawlessly rapping TLC's ""Waterfalls""?"
The sort of story that has so much integrity of storytelling technique on its mind that it pays little heed to its essential lack of satisfaction with any of the characters.
"Cronenberg seems like he has something specific, possibly devilishly satiric in mind, but his screen instincts are numb, constructing a feature that lurches from scene to scene."
A squandered opportunity to tell what may have been an interesting story.
"Sadly, Whiteout wimps out, starting out like The Thing and winding up like CSI: South Pole, wasting whatever it has going for it."
Long after I've forgotten this film -- starting with the stalker chick -- I'll remember the music and what it was trying to communicate when the rest of the film had its headphones on.
It's safe and boring
It's left to David Thewlis as a know-it-all cynical cop to walk away with the whole film. He brings a mischievousness and wit to a movie sorely lacking in both and offers a fine example of what this sequel should have been.
"This is just as unevenly plotted as the original, lacks even the element of surprise, and is not by any reasonable standard “good”. Between gooey and ghoulish, there must be better options."
"While the film is well-intended and scores points for skewering disposable idolatry, it seems off the mark, murky, about its acerbic message."
"Plummer's portrayal deserves a more interesting showcase than this conventional production, aimed at those who value 'culture' over art."
I can't fully endorse or recommend 'Don McKay'--it's too messy and all-over-the-place for that--but it certainly isn't boring. I'll give it that much.
"McGrath has rendered the weighty, moving and engrossing Dickens tale into a near sitcom."
"""Dredd"" is a lot of murk and grunt with no inner engine. And the unnecessary 3-D only makes it look muddier."
"The following is a transcript of Ghostbusters director Ivan Reitman's pitch to investors about his new movie, which eventually would take the name Evolution. Actually, it's bogus, but it saved the reviewer some time and adjectives."
"While the film claims dazzling visuals, Lee fails to deliver the type of never-before-seen martial arts fights fans demand."
The story has little wit and no surprises.
Most of what made the novels so flavorful is sucked from the proceedings resulting in a product that commits the biggest sin a film can commit: blandness.
I can't say Everyone's Hero strikes out -- it might distract little kids for a while -- but the directors needn't bother practicing their home run trots.
"... you may get a half-hour sitcom's worth of laughs, but little more."
It's too smart for kids and too silly for adults.
"It's hard to shake the impression that, while Schrader may be fascinated by what Crane represents, he's not terribly interested in who Crane was."
Never compels the viewer to buy into any of this or to invest emotionally. And the scary stuff is only frighteningly bland.
"The Witch does an excellent job in establishing its 1630s New England setting, but when it comes to the film's storyline, it's never quite able to reach the compelling and disturbing heights that writer/director Robert Eggers strives for."
a nice starting point for an important conversation with your child about why so many cartoons think children are stupid.
"Without much investment, one just sits back with increasing detachment and bemused curiosity as to where and on whom the next shoe will drop."
"As for who other than Terry Gilliam might enjoy it, I'm at a loss."
"It must have been an act of great restraint for Sean Combs to resist titling this film, about Chris Wallace, his close friend turned rapper and cultural icon, The Notorious B.I.G. -- The Sean Combs Story."
The extended cut is ultimately a setup for future films. And could arguably be said that it's just one 4-hour long commercial.
The filmmaking craft may be &#40;mostly&#41; astonishing&#46; But the craft must always &#8212; &lt;i&gt;always&lt;&#47;i&gt; &#8212; be in aid of a compelling story populated by compelling characters&#46;&#46;&#46; and that&#8217;s not so much the case here&#46;
What was an ambitious mix of genres and settings on the written page becomes a woefully incoherent mess of overwrought action and watered-down subtext that won't please either fans or newcomers.
This so silly that it never should have splattered onto the big screen.
"It's a film about the mind that is totally bone-headed, frequently making serious lapses of logic."
"Here's one fictitious Ernest sequel that fits my sentiments exactly: ""Ernest Gets on my Last Nerve"". ""Nuff said..."
A complete and undeniable bore.
"It's as if Hanks and co-writer Nia Vardalos assumed that getting everyone in one place would be enough, and didn't think much further."
"The film feels much like where it came from, modern-day Broadway - a formerly grimy section of New York City that's been scrubbed clean and thoroughly Disneyfied."
"These scripted scenes not only make up a confusing bulk of the movie, but [are] also inelegant and clunky."
"Rom-com writers of America, you're going to have to step up your game."
I don't think it's such a big heresy to say that Terry Gilliam is both a genius and an annoyingly full-of-it director who's coasting on the goodwill he earned with Brazil.
"The movie is hectic, exhausting, and baffling."
"Lacks any insight into the characters involved, and surely would have the late Princess of Wales rolling in her grave."
"Freddie Highmore revisits his role as Arthur with ease, but it's the adults in the film that stumble. Even veteran actors like Mia Farrow phone in their performances."
The results don't come close to duplicating Noonan's charming and gentle barnyard fable [Babe].
"""Bereavement"" isn't a bad slasher film, but after a few stabs (no pun intended) at being something more, it settles for being just a slasher film. And that's disappointing."
I got the feeling that a whole lot of talented people had gone and wasted their time on a project too bland to be worth it.
"Painful to watch, but it's nothing an aspirin can't fix. Might as well save yourself the headache, though."
Ambition is not always the best idea in your story. At this point we must know that not everything has to be at the cost of the entire world in action films. Universe-building harmed the story. [Full review in Spanish]
"Pleasant, mushy, and utterly, utterly soulless."
"The problem is that if you also ponied up for popcorn, parking and childcare, you're going to feel a bit shortchanged."
"With the undistinguished ""Brother Bear,"" Disney seems to have forgotten it no longer monopolizes the animated feature market."
"""A Most Violent Year"" sets the stage for a showdown between principles and base instincts that never satisfyingly arrives."
Good performances by Amanda Seyfried and James Norton are not enough to overcome a lackluster story that doesn't deliver on its potential. [Full review in Spanish]
"Game 6 is ultimately a curious dud, although it makes us anxiously await DeLillo's next time at bat."
"As is true of so many play adaptations, the theatrically pitched performances don't work as well on the screen."
"I wish this movie offered a little less running commentary and a little more running - anything, really, to get itself off the treadmill of self-critique and self-congratulation and actually going somewhere new."
Rob Reiner's inability to elicit some sort of spark between his two leads continues to prove that his best days are behind him.
"Yet another depiction of fading, archaic white patriarchy while also seeming to champion its potency and relevancy."
...a misguided and thoroughly obnoxious piece of work that wears out its welcome almost immediately.
"A perfectly acceptable, perfectly bland, competently acted but by no means scary horror movie."
"We get it: The male villain is a stand-in for the patriarchy, and for women, it’s an uphill battle just to survive. No need to bludgeon us over the head with it."
Curtis has failed to give us characters we can really like.
A well-made yet failed film that could give real pleasure only to those who prefer form over content.
A problem of tone -- it wallows in grim when it should be gleeful and wicked.
&#91;Supposed&#93; to be a self-aware celebration of the whodunnit genre&#46; But unfortunately&#44; just like with the first one&#44; the sequel &#91;isn&apos;t that &#46;&#46;&#46;&#93; Murder Mystery 2 &#46;&#46;&#46; is just pure cringe&#44; somehow always finding itself on the wrong side of the tracks&#46;
Your ability to appreciate the result of this unstoppably bro-tastic marketing juggernaut will depend entirely on your tolerance for bro humor.
"More material divorced from any recognizable social reality piles into Prom, as into an overloaded rental limo."
Never Die Alone might just come to replace Showgirls as the nation's premier midnight-movie howler.
Space Jam: A New Legacy operates the facile modern IP culture consumption machine...only seeking the sinister serotonin rush one receives upon recognizing something.
"Reitman feels the need to amp up the drama, and unloads a honking dump of backstory that's contrived and maudlin in a mode that I had thought was the exclusive province of Nicholas Sparks."
This movie doesn't know if it's a socially conscious flick about feeding starving kids or a steamy romantic drama about two pretty people who like to make out in tents.
"A pal from hell premarital grossout kept afloat by meek makeover man Rudd and brazenly wacko Segel. But those prenuptial same sex chum assignments, public poop pooch pride, and a cozy nook filled with masturbatory chachkas, feel less bonded."
Seems as unhappily divided in its nature as Bruce Banner himself.
Out of the Blue neither sings nor stings.
"Lazily directed by Hathaway, it's pleasant enough, if rather too self-consciously coy."
"The '73 film is brilliantly constructed and ends with a punctuation mark that was shocking in its day. LaBute's movie attempts to shock, as well, and does: Given the names involved and the casting of Cage, it is shockingly bad."
"In developing the property for a broader audience, the film has essentially removed what made its predecessor so effective."
47 Meters Down is one of the more flawed and forgettable shark movies in recent years.
"The scope and style keep things engaging up to a certain point. So, too, does its nightmarish android imagery. But it's too opaque and superficial to sustain the overarching narrative, further hindered by archetypical characters."
"There's enough good here that 'The Pale Door' doesn't feel like a waste of time, but it isn't a strong enough derivation from its inspiration where you'd ever want to watch this instead."
The result is a hard-knocks movie whose edges are smoothed away to please an addiction to happy endings.
"[O]verly long, uninspired, and frequently awful..."
"This film is as bleak as it gets. There's nothing wrong with that, except Donnybrook never is able to develop an entry point. You're on board with its brutality or not."
Seeking to redress horror&#8217;s fraught relationship with LGBTQ&#43; characters&#44; John Logan&#8217;s stilted slasher merely reinforces them&#46;&#10;
"The animation in The Princess and the Frog is beautifully rendered, and the movie doesn't lack for energy. But this is minor Disney at best, forgettable at worst..."
CJ7 is heavy on slapstick and may appeal to very young viewers who won't need to bother much with the subtitles.
Like a Syfy Channel movie - but with better acting and more expensive special effects . . .
"It tries for the greatest realism in its obligatory shots of gas tanks exploding, and yet includes such absurdities as a local news helicopter that tracks all of the competitors all the way from LA to New York."
"The hyperactive adventure is more exhausting than endearing, despite some intermittent laughs."
"It's silly rather than legitimately morbid, and not creatively silly, either."
"The best recent parody movie. Not because it's good, but because it's only unbelievably boring while the others were unbearably irritating."
Waiting for it to finish is like sitting bored on a hard plastic chair and then realising your phone has run out of battery but the charger is packed in a suitcase you already checked in.
We can spot every single plot turn coming across the tidelands from five kilometers away. Certainly someone deserves to get shot.
"When Bullock does an about-face to do the right thing at the film's conclusion, it packs no punch."
"The story is confusingly told -- everything is not illuminated -- and, as the seeker, Elijah Wood is a big blank."

I've never seen a movie with so many recycled gags and cliches.
It has a way of wearing out what's supposed to be knockabout farce.
Two great veteran actors from either side of the Atlantic do their best with frustratingly uneven material.
"I'm not saying we shouldn't make films about Winston Churchill, or historical figures like him. But we shouldn't be fawning over them uncritically, or canonizing actors like Gary Oldman in their making."
"Oceans floods us with stunning visuals of the panoply of sea life. But without a compelling story, or a strong point of view, or mere information, we can only 'ooh' and 'aah' so much."
"Border is strange, disturbing and brave in its own way, but not everyone will be willing to accept its nervy, visceral terror."
"Though not quite as funny, clever or exciting as it thinks it is, this remains a watchable adventure comedy with good comic performances and the occasional moment of inspiration."
"""Never look away,"" we're told for the umpteenth time. But with von Donnersmarck serving as a dubious Virgil through the circles of 20th century history, you're better off just looking elsewhere."
The need to create a prequel to &apos;Despicable Me&apos; does a disservice to a potentially amusing &apos;Minions&apos; sequel in this visually dazzling and kid-friendly animated comedy&#46;&#10;
"While based on a true story ... and featuring several powerful moments, the film is conventional to the point of distraction ..."

"Tries to get a lot of mileage out of very little movement, ultimately reaching unbelievable resolutions (a few inspired by famous films) with very little enthusiasm."
The movie feels like the work of a capable but uninspired cover band. Before we had Treadstone; now we have re-Treadstone.
'6 Underground' deserves to be buried alive.
Implausible - with every urban cliche and stereotype - a complete waste of time and money.
"As fragmented and heavy-handed as the first installment was smart, funny and, yes, at times unexpectedly sweet."
"Here's a bland movie about a bad boy named Bundy that bagged a bunch of showbiz buzz, but didn't open big, because, although it stars ""Baywatch"" beefcake Zac Efron, it's almost blasphemously blah."
One just has to throw up one's fins and give in to the ridiculousness.
"Starring bright animation and the voices of Justin Long and Dawyne Johnson, Planet 51 follows a hilarious concept with weak execution and way too many references to better films."
"Its exploitation of tragic iconography -- just to amp up the screams, tug some tears and sell a few more million movie tickets -- should be deplored."
"Witless, charmless, clumsy and appallingly unenjoyable, The Green Hornet is almost unrecognizable as having come from the same, endlessly inventive storehouse of creativity as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."
Operation Fortune&#58; Ruse de Guerre&#44; on paper&#44; is the quintessential Guy Ritchie picture&#44; and yet it somehow falls to the bottom of the pack&#46;&#10;&#10;

"In 'From Paris with Love,' Wax destroys half of the City of Light's underworld in order to stop either a drug ring or a terrorist cell."
"Here's a stretch: Elizabeth Hurley is a sexy English girl and Matthew Perry is Chandler in this senseless, surprisingly unfunny comedy."
The movie becomes a bit too campy
"Not one frame feels authentic, from terribly Photoshopped images of the young Swede (McGregor as a football hero? Right!) to laughable old-age makeup in the later years."
a fitfully engrossing and overreaching film that is both somehow too much and yet not enough.
"Left us all weary, begging for a rest."

Only very small children are likely to be satisfied.
"Bedtime Stories is not my cup of tea. Even the saucer. Fairness requires me to report, however, that it may appeal to, as they say, 'kids of all ages.'"
"This sequel is, like most sequels, a watered down version of the first film."
Maybe the writer-director found himself adrift in the corn fields.
... well-crafted but unremarkable ...
"“Mija” is a sluggish, meandering documentary that touches — but only touches — on something interesting: the experience of undocumented immigrants and their U.S.-born children."
"The special effects are rarely special. Bad movie practice looms large as characters have private conversations out in the open or worse again, narrate the action."
"The result is a fascinating Cold War spy story, but one with a few too many unanswered questions and unlit corners."
"While the rejuvenation of the franchise has been put on temporary hold, be assured that 'Quantum of Solace' sparkles with all the wit and heart-pounding excitement of a movie that takes its name from an Ian Fleming story about cocktail-party chitchat."
"The human beings are so sluggish and stupid that, if Earth's fate was actually left in their hands, you'd rather trust the aliens."
Vampires are treated like one of many cliches in this underwhelming horror-action-comedy that has little charisma of its own.
'Spectre' Is The Worst 007 Movie In 30 Years.

This is a film that makes a superb actress (who does a great job) shine... but nothing more. [Full review in spanish]
"While the film is stunning to look at, the added scenes and scenery-devouring acting fall flat."
Bleah...Avoid.
Murphy and Lawrence never quite move beyond shtick&#46;
"A numb, oddly dispassionate trudge toward predestined doom, inevitable in all the wrong ways."
It's so familiar and repetitive that it doesn't have much ghoulish impact.
Loses the most important part of Shakespeare: his insight into human behavior.
The cameras of 'Meru' merely bear witness to the act rather than explore the root of obsession that motivates the triumph.
"Not exactly a thriller, never quite a chiller, hardly suspenseful, it is, at best, a Sandra Bullock vehicle made of vanishing vapors."
"Tries to be funny, tries to be S&M. Directed by a guy called Pitof. Me-owwww!"
"This starts to get interesting in the homestretch, as the woman's chronic deception begins to catch up with her, but for the most part it's an extended Geritol commercial."
"The Amazing Spider-Man 2, the fifth Spidey movie in 12 years, is overlong, underwhelming, unnecessary and sure to be a hot ticket."
"Despite all of its attempts at a unique sci-fi vision, the film still plays out in a rather generic fashion, full of conventional personas."
"Unfortunately, it doesn't quite live up to the first film as an inventive new horror franchise, more of a tired retread of a decent indie thriller."
It's an accretion - a buildup of plotlines and characters that rolls toward its conclusion by dint of momentum lent to it by all that's come before.
Did I mention the locusts&#63; Because I&#8217;m here to see dinosaurs&#44; not bugs that are a bit larger than they ought to be&#46;
"To call this a dad movie is to be inappropriate to your dad, who's almost certainly too cool to do anything other than doze off during this dry, dust-choked bit of boredom for all involved."
Kiddie matinee fluff has fun action moments.
"It has none of the sweep of, say, Syriana, as if that mattered to the audience it's gunning for."
"The result is a political thriller refreshingly long on grown-up dialogue yet lamentably shy on, well, thrills. This chatty thing does go on."
"The suits never understood him, but I don't think ham-fisted director Joshua Michael Stern knows all that much about his subject either..."
"Anger Management inspires only limp accolades, but it's just amusing enough to earn a look on a chilly, rainy April day."
"The whole thing is so deja vu , it gets kind of ho-hum, despite the increased body count and quick running time."
Characters barely described in the play get turned into Tyler Perry clichés.
Short on belly laughs.
"Bland, though well-meaning, animated fable."
"everything...seems appropriated & overdone, second-hand & shop-soiled, like a pre-owned home that has seen better days. While there is a great deal of craft in the filmmaking, that atmospheric house has surprisingly little room to accommodate originality "
"It hardly stirs the heart, at least not as much as you feel it should have done."
An unfunny comedy with a limited imagination and a steady diet of fat jokes.
"An innocuous, fluffy little nothing of an almost-pleasant movie."
"It looks and feels like the movie you initially fell in love with, yet it offers little of the pleasure or magic that won you over in the first place."
"Despite Borchardt's scary self-conviction, I'm not sure we're so easily convinced he deserves to make movies--or be the star of this one."
"The show, Pop-art colourful and simple in design, is delivered in 11-minute hits, two per episode. Truth be told, the full 99-minute movie does not entirely hold water; it feels like three or four good episodes connected with plot padding."
"John Shakespeare In Love Madden directs, but literary larks in the Globe are a long way from the laboured, catchpenny lucubrations of this global retribution tale."
"[The] camera constantly strays from the main action to capture moments of local scenery in an attempt to prove how ""real"" it all is."
Things happen&#44; and there&#8217;s a story&#44; but Ponsoldt seems almost wholly uninterested in the events on-screen&#46; What he seems to be after is what those events signify&#46;
"Traducing genuine suffering as mere histrionics (even the scaling of a fish becomes an excuse for violence), Aïnouz unnerves and alienates where he might illuminate."
"Seidelman's unflagging enthusiasm, which extends to her buoyant cast, winds up giving this superficial story a bit of unexpected depth."
"Rather than deepening the mystery and sense of intoxication, the picture soon becomes one prolonged and very bad hangover."
"The plot, as hinted, goes strictly by the How April Got Her Groove Back book, but it must be said that the performances push it a notch above pedestrian."
"Instead, why not compare it to Waititi's Thor: Ragnarok, yet another poorly planned improviso, lacking direction, depth, story, character development and the ability to engage the viewer."
"If you are looking for classic Saw, unfortunately this film only partially delivers, with the same being said for its attempt at fresh originality."
Less a Rock-buster than a quake'n'bake reheat of post-Emmerich basics. The cast's likeable work falls right through the script holes.
"While this film has an 'A' list cast and some strong supporting players, the tale -- like its central figure, Vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love."
"Leonetti's prequel is about as lifeless and wooden as the Annabelle doll herself, despite trying to mimic James Wan every step of the way."
You've seen this movie without even seeing it.
"2012 director Roland Emmerich never met a landmark he didn't want to crush with a digitized fireball, boulder or avalanche."
200 Motels may pass for sophistication in some quarters but sophomoric is a better description. It is a mixture of rock music and fantasy with very little story line.
Double Jeopardy is single-minded and engaging thriller storytelling without an afterglow.
"Some of ""After Earth"" is intriguing, if you ignore the premise and the story and the direction and much of Jaden Smith's performance. Other than that..."
A spirit of fun and adventure almost breaks through. Call it a near myth.
There's not a single shred of the movie that makes sense.
Seberg remains a bit of a blank.
"As of now, the scariest four words in the English language are officially 'A Shawn Levy Film.'"
Even as it is a rather plainly shot film that never seems clear about the tone it is trying to strike&#44; Hawkins pushes onward&#46; That the film crumbles beneath her feet with every step she takes makes it a misfire when it should have been a marvel&#46; 
"If you're looking for misogyny, racism, homophobia, and contempt for poor people disguised as humor, this movie is for you."
"Gemini Man could have been a guilty pleasure form of entertainment, but instead, it's clumsy and wooden. A waste of time for a movie fan."
Why waste your quarters on the video games in the mall when you can pay $10 to see the same thing on the big screen?
"The fourth and, amazingly, the most meat-headed adventure yet of the killing machine John Rambo can safely be recommended to people who hate intelligence and love exploding body parts."
"Loneliness, arrested development and the slow disintegration of the imagination are all topics of interest to the directors, but they approach each with only a cool level of ironic detachment that becomes unbearable after 90 minutes."
Has this script been in a drawer somewhere since 1942?
We're given a flawed premise and told to deal with it.
"""Bleeding Heart"" may deliver some much needed catharsis, but it's ultimately a hollow film that isn't concerned with consequences or the echoing cycle of violence, just vanquishing the bad guy, reclaiming a dime store sense of freedom, and not much more."
"The film is a series of episodic scenes which spotlight a host of characters who, without narrative material, become a mere collection of quirks, costumes, and gestures."
I don’t think this is a successful romantic comedy. I am almost offended...
"""Every Day"" [is] more ambitious than your average teen romance, which only makes it all the more disappointing that it simply remains an average teen romance."
Merely puts Tillman on a different kind of pedestal and celebrates him as a different sort of idol than the military and media had done in the past.
"An insultingly bad movie, and even the flashiest, most distracting sound and visual gimmicks cannot hide this fact."
"It abandons its subtlety and sense of mystery en route to becoming a typically moralistic screed about the preservation of the nuclear family, alongside an obvious but never-quite-resolved cautionary tale about the importance of conservation."
"When A Love Song for Bobby Long concentrates on moving its plot forward, it aims too wide and clumsily lays bare all its secrets and twists."
Will you ever eat prime rib again?
There isn't a whisper of spontaneity.
"Tame by Sandler's current standards, the movie feels like a throwback; it brings to mind the blandly crappy movies Sandler made 10 years ago, rather than the brazenly crappy movies he makes today."
"Younger jacks up the action in the last third, but the air goes out of a fight movie when you can see the next jab coming."
A little Russell Brand goes a long way.
...stagnant and ponderous.
"Gags that feel tired, too many musical interludes, a story that doesn't really progress from the first film -- Shrek 2 feels a day late and an enchanted princess short."
"Untraceable could have been a much more interesting film if it had simply stayed closer to its wonkish, Internet-flavored thriller roots."
The film quickly devolves into tired clichs and jokes.
"Though Logelin's story of loss and perseverance is touching, there isn't really anything deep or convincing about grief or parenting in ""Fatherhood,"" making this promising tale something more middling and a touch disappointing."
... a disaster.
"[Perry has] recycled the same material so many times, it's starting to turn rancid."
"... more of the same, with just a hint of soul searching between the pop-culture wrestling matches and scatological tirades."
"The magazine piece was convoluted at best, and writer-director Richard Shepard doesn't make things much clearer."
Mindless piffle.
A tedious affair with little to offer other than a chance for your child to see a hugely forgettable romp.
The film is plastered with references&#44; easter eggs&#44; and just about everything you can imagine from the game&#46; So much so that the story is bare-bones as Mario simply jumps from one colorful screen to the next without a care in the world&#46;
"If passion were all that mattered, ""Let Fury Have the Hour"" might be the film of the year."
"It wants to be a gripping police thriller and a tragic melodrama at the same time, and ultimately fails to convince as either."
The latest of Kline's period pictures that wastes no time in dashing your expectations.
"Camelot gets changed a lot in this down-and-dirty, unmagical take on the Arthurian legends."
It's like watching the dreckiest of teen puppy courtships trying to pass itself off as 'Annie Hall.
[Director] Perelman applies a rigorous visual beauty to this thin gimmick of a movie.
Seldom does one find a film that meets expectations so thoroughly.
The movie &#46;&#46;&#46; ostensibly tells Brown&apos;s story&#44; but it seems strangely reluctant to see that story through the man&apos;s own eyes&#46;
The film is sstrictly a high-tech spin on one of those Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark.
"Paranormal Activity 4 is arguably the weakest entry in the series, but if one still gets their kicks out of these films then that probably won't mean all that much."
"In Fear finally feels disappointingly conventional, losing faith in its primitive method."
The momentary flashes of authenticity can't save the film from its disingenuous slushiness
"Though the film's stylings are a little mannered, the two female leads are compelling screen presences, especially Garrel, who relishes the melodrama of fresh heartbreak."
"Despite its visual beauty and Rahim's extraordinary, and silent, performance, the film never quite manages to connect on an emotional level."
Blueback simply doesn&apos;t tell enough of a story for us to really care about a lesson as predictable and self-evident as the one being presented here&#46;
"The film feels rushed throughout, and especially during its overly action-packed finale."
He who has to ask what yoga is never gets to know.
"Double, double toil and trouble/ Fire burn and cauldron bubble./ Hocus Pocus' sequel stumbles/ in a plot that often crumbles./ While not awful, tis a struggle.

That&apos;s what I love about these Minions&#44; man&#46; I get older and they stay the same&#46;
Glowering at the centre of it all is Foy. It is not the actor's fault that you sometimes drift off and find yourself wondering why the Queen looks so irritated. But you do.
Somebody somewhere forgot that a film needs a streamlined story to make visual chaos palatable.
Zoolander 2 death-marches its way through a tiresome succession of espionage movie clichés and cameos.
"Former music-video auteur Millicent Shelton penned the script, which, if you cut out all the obscenities and flatulence jokes, could comfortably fit on the back of her business card."
A dizzying cavalcade of celebrity cameos in place of jokes.
So entirely disappointing that it diminishes any fond memories of the original.
For about an hour of running time nothing much actually happens . . .
"The Muppets are on the lam in ""Muppets Most Wanted,"" but sorry, these aren't the Muppets you're looking for."
"""Antlers"" is more dreary than it is scary."
"Imagine your Windows desktop screen, but even less upsetting, off-putting, and terrifying."
"Even as a mindless diversion, it's weak."
"Messing-Mulroney romantic comedy has ""something borrowed"" in its plot -- and a sense of missed opportunity that'll leave you blue."
A central figure who's all bad is even more boring than one who's all good. He has no dramatic stature. He's a case study. The audience should be paid to listen up.
Eddie Murphy funny? Not here.
"Maggie could have been a rare treat... Instead, what we get is a genuinely new take that winds up feeling, somehow, like the same old stuff we've seen a million times before."
A beautiful extravagance that's weighed down by its excess. [Full Review in Spanish]
This is the kind of formulaic horror pap Wes Craven spoofed with the Scream series.
Sheer wooliness undermines the sober political stance of John Malkovich's overexcited directorial debut.
The film strains to be funny just as hard as the audience strains to stay awake.
"For all the technical achievements and Christopher Nolan's potentially captivating time-inversion concept, ""Tenet"" lacks the heart and soul to qualify as among the best movies in his illustrious filmography."
"The movie's first half is filled with tumult, menace and a vivid sense of place; the second half, which emphasizes the idea that the comfortable and well-educated Saroo is a 'lost' soul (literally), is tedious."
Any adults accompanying those children may wish they were watching the Hoskins and Leguizamo film instead.
"Dining out at a fancy restaurant somewhere in Europe, Kate McKinnon's character becomes overrun with the need to let out some diarrhea, which is kind of what the filmmakers are doing here"
Smiths fans may well despair. And not in a way they'd enjoy.
Surveillance. A motorcycle chase with surveillance. A foot chase with surveillance. Rinse and repeat until the climactic car chase...and all we've really learned is one more reason Jason Bourne has to rage against the C.I.A.
"This grim, joyless motion picture is anything but fun. It's a chore to sit through, with all the blazing, noisy pyrotechnics proving unable to lighten the mood."
"""Battleship"" employs the same nonintelligent strategy as the Hasbro board game: Fire blindly at broad targets and wait for explosions."
"It'd be nice to say that Hardy, a fine actor, is actually given a chance to act. But he's basically just a Looney-Tunes punching bag."
"It tries to emulate the great Spencer Tracy-Katharine Hepburn classics, but ends up a pale copy."
There's little here to elevate the film beyond its good intentions.
"We know that the makers of this film are capable of something slightly more grand-scale than ""video game commercial"". They're just not interested in actually doing it."
"The direction, by George Hickenlooper, has no snap to it, no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism."
"A trashy, scattershot serial-drama-cum-media satire that's more agenda-based than character-based. One day we'll look back and chuckle at how seriously people took Gone Girl the same way we do now at Fatal Attraction."
2 hours and 20 minutes of my life that I'll never get back.
"The problem is that Shyamalan's narrative begins to feel like a shopping list of outlandishness, as if he'd sat around with the crew saying ""what bizarre occurrences can we think up next?"""
"""Hellboy"" plays out as a non-interactive video game. It would be a lot more fun if you were the one swinging a virtual sword and making body parts fly. Assuming you're into that sort of thing."
"An ambitious, old fashioned, ideas-driven science fiction film that is never as mind-expanding as its futuristic images and topical, dystopian ideas seem to promise."
"Without Denzel Washington's charm - the cocked head, the sly, toothy grin and eyes that scream 'trust me' - a thriller as lame and preposterous as 'Out of Time' would just sink back into the lethargic swamp of sweat-soaked neo-noir that seems to seep in e"
"The Aeronauts never really feels genuinely magical despite its welcome celebration of scientific discovery, and the dialogue is uninspired."
The movie's design is its only redeeming feature. This is one movie which seems to have been made almost exclusively for members of a Dungeons & Dragons fan club. 
"does deserve points for an atmospheric first hour, it's undone by bad acting and a pedestrian ending."
It's an ill-conceived reworking of the 1984 film that changes the time and place but retains the laughably serious tone and gleefully preposterous plotting.
"Despite some amusing moments, everyone simply works too hard at providing rambunctious zaniness, until one grows painfully aware the inevitable outtakes reel will be superior to the movie."
"It lurches along, making Ms. Bell and Mr. Duhamel look duller than they need to."
"In the end, despite its quirky twists on the genre, Wyrmwood is just another zombie flick, riffing on its predecessors and hoping that'll suffice."
"Loaded with cheesy re-enactments and archival footage that evoke a 1970s vibe, the film plays like a bad episode of Forensic Files."
"For anyone on the outside looking in, the insulation of the characters from real danger makes it a bit of a drag."
"The blend of romantic comedy and road movie is an awkward match, and isn't helped by a stodgy script and the fact that Butler has little in the way of comic timing."
"Is it funny? Fitfully, but not consistently enough."
The whole thing feels programmed; the movie's sense of humor lacks understatement. So does the movie's sense of pathos.
"Despite the sound and fury surrounding its release, Dogma doesn't signify anything beyond the truth of Kevin Smith's repeated insistence that he's not much of a filmmaker."
"You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally."
"Everything about this film feels very much like a Carpenter homage, but, unfortunately, that means that it is more ""Escape From L.A."" than ""Escape from New York."""
"The cast would have been better served by a middle school production overseen by a creatively frustrated, inappropriately ambitious drama teacher than by this hacky, borderline-incompetent production ..."
Lucky Number Slevin smacks of so much smugness that you want to go up to the screen and slap it.
The suds from all these soap-opera shenanigans theoretically should have been enough to douse all the fires seen throughout this draggy picture.
"After an initial burst of energy, things trudge along."
"The two leads are playing roles they aren't suited for, and what's worse is that the only chemistry between them is what happens when an acid and a base meet."
"Inside Llewlyn Davis looks and sounds fantastic, but the indecisive performances from its cast and the aimless story isn't enough to captivate this reviewer."
These Titans are forgettable indeed.
"There is such a chasm between the unreadable character we see and the extraordinary grisliness of Dahmer's crimes that this depiction is as helpful as those inevitable attributions of mass murderers as ""quiet, normal-seeming"" men from shocked neighbors."
Stephen Frears drapes Tamara Drewe over the screen like a patchwork quilt of half-finished comic sketches and pointless sub-plots.
"A cliched and frequently stodgy affair...pales in comparison to [Corbjin's] previous effort, or indeed, other recent le Carre adaptations."
An ambitious but muddled mix of Christmas comedy and apocalyptic drama.
I can&apos;t adequately express how soul-sucking the crime subplot is here&#46;
Might be vaguely entertaining if you were holding a Wiimote.
"The possibility of a fourth film is alluded to in the screenplay, but let's hope the filmmakers decide to leave that one where it belongs -- in the crypt."
What needs to be epic often seems petty and small. Perhaps it was in compensation for this narrative inadequacy that the musical score grew to be sweepingly grand and intrusively ever-present.
"A serial killer movie without any threat, a cop thriller going through the motions, and De Niro and Pacino seem blunted by the piece's overall lack of bite."
"The Altmans might be way ahead of the Osbournes and Kardashians in terms of letting their private moments hang out, but the movie is as profound as a reality show in its exploration of family dynamics."
"The character would be bad enough, but it's the way The Bronze tries to turn her into some kind of wounded, troubled soul that really irritates."
"A half-baked breadstick posing as haute cuisine, this movie is neither filling, nor as slyly sophisticated as it pretends to be."
Maybe Blomkamp should give sci-fi another shot.
"An empty shell of a film, devoid of heart and soul, leaving us to wonder how in the world this movie ever got released."
Awesome photography but possessing more schmaltz than herring shoppers will find at Zabar's on a Sunday shopping spree.
"As a big John Lennon fan, I was looking forward to seeing this documentary, but was disappointed by its relative simplicity in scope and presentation."
"The 5th Wave plays like a Wayans-brothers spoof of movies based on dystopian Young Adult novels. Seriously, it could have been called YA Movie the way it wallows in all the overly familiar tropes of the genre."
A capable feature debut from Dave Franco that gets horror aspects right but struggles to develop the characters.
More time seems to be spent on giving Schwarzenegger corny one-liners than establishing the TX as a genuine threat.
Samuell has his gorgeous but borderline-psychopathic characters devise nasty pranks that not only strike each other in the hearts but inflict much collateral damage.
"Kosinski can’t make the inane philosophizing about free will sound profound or new, and the hectic, hasty finale, lacking the nerve or chilly interiority of the original story, plays like something that blew up in the lab."
The usually dependable Rob Cohen directs from a ludicrous script.
Australian revenge thriller is a terrible dud
It sticks so closely to the YA formula that it feels like a mashup of a watery fantasy with soap opera. Suds overflow.
"Full of It isn't just a title. Add an S and an H, and you have my most honest review."
"In addition to its armchair analysis, A Private War offers a lead performance that calls attention to itself."
"Drillbit Taylor's Superbad-lite with younger actors, mild language, and far fewer laughs."
"Rather than go all-in on exploring heavy issues regarding race, appropriation, depression, and anxiety, Silva chooses to teeter on the edge before letting the thought dissolve into nothing."
A cartoony and messy narrative that is mostly style over substance.
Too dull even to function as camp.
"The real women of the Ford plant - seen briefly and tantalizing in footage played over the credits - surely could tell a more compelling story than this agreeable but overfamiliar effort; perhaps some documentarian, some day, will give them the chance."
"The characters feel so distant in this cold satire. Even with Karen Gillan playing her roles well, it's still hard to make a full connection with what's happening."
Anyone over 6 will grow bored with this film.
"After having seen five of these films, which equates to close to a day of my life that I'll never get back, I can say that Transformers 5 is on a level with Transformers 1."
"Instead of inspired Hollywood Shuffle-style parody, we get caricatures of color and glib riffs about economic insolvency in black America."
"Torments us not only with repeated and recycled material from the first films, but also tired haunted house type horror conventions. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Sexual Content, etc. - also Available)"
"The performances are universally pitched at a to-the-rafters level that comes off poorly on camera, while the stereoscopic photography is more distracting than immersive ..."
"There are a few thrills in this horror movie concerning the radioactive world of Chernobyl, but overall the movie is tedious and predictable."
This Bond doesn't stop for donuts or martinis....Exhume Die Another Day and you'll find a fascinating allegory about the 2002 Second Coming of the Bush presidency.
The film co-opts novelistic tactics for little discernible rhetorical or emotional effect.
"Will you be eager to learn more about this fierce ""Warrior Queen"" afterward? Yes. Will it be because you sensed more there than was melodramatically delivered? Probably."
"While featuring two well-known leads from the annals of cinema, whose presence here is bound to attract a certain interest to the title, they are unfortunately encapsulated in a film as flat as a plateau and barren as wintry tundra."
"There are many, many feelings stuck into Her, pin-cushion-style, but the result is a kind of overstuffed stupefaction."
"While ""Free State of Jones"" offers some action, it is woefully bogged down in simple and clichd bromides about freedom and equality."
"When Snow rides into battle wielding a sword, you want to tell her to put that thing down before she pokes her eye out."
"Some good effects work, but the movie sinks like the other half of the aforementioned vessel."
"Twilight: Breaking Dawn - Part 2 is coming out later this year, right? So at least this will only be the 2nd worst vampire vs. werewolf movie of 2012."
"Just like his previous film, The Childhood of a Leader, Corbet's technical skill as a director is undermined by his inability to subtly convey his themes, or even make his characters sound like normal human beings in their most grounded moments."
This is a case where the dangers of the ocean depths prove far less lethal than a screenwriter with a lack of imagination.
"This has the feel of a beginner's film and has some fun moments and a good performance by John Malkovich, but overall does not have enough to keep it going."
"Sigh. Folks. It's 2016. I mean, seriously. Aren't we past these pathetic stereotypes by now? Can't we move away from these ridiculous disability as tragedy storylines?"
"Like most lazily made kids pictures, the filmmakers operate on the assumption that children will sit through anything as long as the screen is filled with multicolored busyness."
"Sure it's a bad film, but what makes it worse is the ending, which is the worst of the year."
"Cdric Klapisch has been compared to Truffaut, but the new-waver's weakness for glib sentimentalism seems to have left the biggest impression on L'Auberge Espagnole."
You don't even have to be familiar with the first movie made from the Hitman title (or even remember that there was one) to judge this reboot
"Some of my best friends have read and enjoyed The DaVinci Code, and I will do my best not to hold that against them."
'A' for creativity but comes across more as a sketch for a full-length comedy.
"Polanski does a good job at keeping things tense, but comparisons with Hitchcock are overly flattering..."
A hand-me-down ornament for your holiday film season.
It's entirely possible to share the movie's political concerns and even outrage over the practices on display and still resent being beaten over the head with the message.
All these sinister snowmen-are we in some sort of dark Pillsbury universe here?
"There is next to no dialogue in the film's final 30 minutes %u2013 just a torrent of killing, blood and violence. The film's target market of young testosterone-charged males will no doubt be eager to immerse themselves in this blood-fest of stunts and sp"

"Pushing the boundaries of taste isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the film is so busy daring its audience to hurl insults that it forgets to simply be funny."
"An amusing but wholly forgettable assemblage of scenes, some very funny, others thankfully brief, that you should absolutely catch bits of when it is on cable."
"Gratuitous gore, contrived plotting... and Ray Winstone's butcher cameo deserves to be filleted."
I can only suggest that much effort and money might have been saved by borrowing Mitzi Green from Paramount to play all the parts. 
"As impressive as the Old City locations can be, one narrow alleyway looks much like another when the Paz brothers' camera is bouncing to and fro. Not much substance is buried beneath the irritating style."
Apted is without a doubt one of the foremost documentarians working today. His Up Series represents a cinematic hallmark. His feature credits are less certain.
"Choosing to ignore abuse, and taking away Anne's voice and agency in order to give a fuller view to Hazanavicius' beloved, Le Redoutable becomes much worse than a simple empty pastiche, verging into its own misogyny."
"There's a great cast, and a great director, but ultimately the finishing product fails to live up to any potential."
The only joy in this movie comes from its precise mimicry&#46; It has no identity of its own&#44; which becomes depressingly apparent when the franchise&#8217;s old and new characters finally come face to face&#46; 
"refuses to go beyond shallow observations and silly slapstick, making for an ordinary outing when that should not be the case"
"A case involving the murder of a black youth gets solved here, but absolutely nothing could help this numbingly awful, undoubtedly well-intentioned but who-cares-it's-so-bad farrago."
"El Arbi and Fallah have found a cinematic middle ground: their action sequences are slightly more lucid than Bay's, but they are no fussier than he was about tank-sized holes in the plot."
Even by the standards of big-budget comic-book adaptations&#44; this sprawling special-effects bonanza emphasizes spectacle over substance&#44; and formula over freshness&#46;
"Fiction that hews close to fact, the movie is serious and meticulous, yet hollow."
"There's little to say about Problem Child 2, except that it is considerably more problematic than its predecessor.  [Full review in Spanish[] "
The Invitation takes way too long getting to its most interesting ideas&#44; leaving us with the distinct feeling of &#8220;too little&#44; too late&#46;&#8221;
"It's good to see Snipes back on the big screen, and the scenes he shares with Cheadle are a highlight. But there's so much unremitting pain, such a constant string of calamities in the lives of all the players, that the dreariness overshadows the story."
"Lacking anything resembling subtext and anything resembling genuine suspense, The Beginning is little more than just another hackneyed rehash of increasingly diminishing returns."
"""Seance"" proves a disappointingly boilerplate retro slasher that's pedestrian on every level from concept to execution."
A bargain basement melding of clichés from the X-Men franchise and TV's Heroes.
"We see ... misery, betrayal, heartbreak, ridiculous plot twists and, after he sustains a stroke, Hopkins apparently doing a composite impression of Popeye and Quasimodo."
"The movie builds a moderate, if less than monumental, level of spookiness, regardless of your ignorance. It's a workmanlike piece of suspense."
"This bullet-riddled domino effect of surprise complications, deception, duplicitous relationships, and mayhem is vintage Peckinpah and Tarantino minus the compelling characters."
"Spurlock, who revolutionized activist documentary filmmaking with Super Size Me, has set the genre back with this cinema equivalent of a glossy teen magazine cover."
"Honore uses an ultraserious, would-be stylish approach that ultimately renders the depraved proceedings far more boring than titillating."
The sacrificial references to Iphigenia and Isaac elevate the tone but don't really bring extra meaning to a tale that is cruel and vaguely satirical without really being about anything at all.
"[It] thinks a sex-obsessed version of a John Hughes comedy by its very nature is hilarious. It's not, but there are still some things to like here."
This damned thing is all over the place - warm fuzzies to edge-of-your-seat violence.

A totally misguided attempt to contemporize the Regency era book&#46;&#46;&#46;&#46;Jane Austen purists are advised to avoid it&#44; though the same suggestion could also be made to those who wouldn&#8217;t know Jane Austen from Austin Butler&#46;
This entertaining but eventually forgettable remix starts to feel as pointless as the rest of Disney's recent remakes.

"Playing out to the histrionic squalling of a country-infused score, this is film-making that aims to smite its audience into submission."
"Despite the interesting premise of the film and the fact that we get to see Simon Pegg in a departure type character this was not a film which lived up to my standards. Or, I would imagine, anyone's."
Good for Reese Witherspoon and Sofia Vergara for becoming close friends and partners in crime during filming. But there's no need for you to be handcuffed to this mess too.

"Not only does W. fail as both drama and comedy, it's unclear which sequences are meant to be which."

"A biopic whose greatest merit is, perhaps, to let young moviegoers know who Gloria Grahame was. (Complete review in Spanish in the Mexican newspaper Reforma)."
&apos;Ant-Man and the Wasp&#58; Quantumania&apos; is the weirdest&#44; most fun movie of the three&#46; Yet&#44; it&apos;s bogged down by serving as another stepping stone on the road to Marvel&apos;s Multiverse Saga&#46;
"I want the Evelyn Salt workout. Otherwise, Salt is ridiculous."
"The only thing that changes is the star: Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, David Spade or Rob Schneider. Other than that they're the same movie over and over again."
"The Hunt thinks it is a clever and pointed film about contemporary America, but in reality, it's little more than a pig dressed up in human clothes."
"As the mismatched interrogators, Travolta and Nielson seem to be in two different and incompatible movies."
With its so-so animation and excitable nature is less a movie than a PlayStation 2 game blown up for the big screen.
A strictly by-the-numbers political thriller that fails to capitalize on Idris Elba's formidable screen presence.
"Concentrating as much on the detectives investigating the case as on the killers, Lonely Hearts fails to show off its impressive cast at their best."
It should come as no surprise that the man who hasn't made a good film in 25 years has produced another dud.
"Aerial scenes, family drama and aircraft carrier sequences all are well done... [But] viewers should leave the theater feeling inspired by Jesse Brown's valiant deeds. But due to the script's blunders, they may not."
"If I were the real Patch Adams, I'd sue for malpractice!"
Hustle & Flow promises gritty street drama but delivers Pretty Woman with crunk instead of Roxette.
Cox's film is really an empty experience.
"There's a handful of delightful moments, but most of it feels 30 years too late to carry any sort of fist-pumping resonance"
"Even the wondrously choreographed stunting that keeps everything flying, flipping, careening, and cartwheeling in every direction starts to look like some demented Cirque de Soleil performance with a demolition derby theme after a while."
"Aronofsky has missed the boat on fulfilling this story's full potential. In terms of money spent and talent procured, this is a major creative fiasco in the annals of big-screen turkeys."
What's wrong with The Number 23 can't be blamed on Schumacher -- though he ought to have known better than to sign on board this project.
"It knows the cliches of B movies, but not the intentions."
"The Saw series isn't nearly as interesting without Jigsaw, but it's getting harder and harder to find ways to include him in increasingly-desperate sequels."
You figure the alleged final destination would have more to offer audiences...
"Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ..."
"For a film about the efforts to clear one man's name, the treatment of Scruggs in Richard Jewell seems like hypocrisy - with a side-order of misogyny - of the worst sort."
"James Wan, you are missed behind the camera."
That the Purge is now threatening the powerful people who created it AND that myriad Americans are attempting to flee the violence in the U.S. for Mexico should generate a more delicious irony here.
'Karate! Kung fu! Whatever!' says Mom. Exactly!... The important thing is that the cute little American kid will teach the Chinese ignoramuses a thing or two about their own culture. Stupid foreigners!

The film reflects on the moment personal and professional politics became irrevocably intertwined without questioning what's really so harmful about it.
"Not scary and ridiculous at times, Lawnmower Man is a wasted opportunity."

Flimsy dramatization of Russia/Georgia conflict fails both as historical re-enactment and as action-flick thrill ride.
Moviegoers likely will be able to fill in the blanks more quickly than the characters.
&#8220;V&#47;H&#47;S&#47;99&#8221; has periodic oddity&#44; but not enough to sustain the creative excitement found in the previous endeavor&#46;
"Despite some interesting ideas about the role memory plays in our sense of self, the film remains mostly just an exercise in melancholy."
"Yes, Roy Cohn had his fingers in a lot of pots, but Meeropol never makes clear why his influence and dishonesty was or is significant outside of the Rosenbergs."
"Well, it finally happened. The line separating America from America: The Movie found a way to arrange itself into a stick figure and walk off the scene in disgust."
I think the filmmakers wanted this movie to be some kind of homage to old Hong Kong kung-fu flicks ... But is this a joke or a sincere ode?
A little more cinematic flair might have made Sparkle live up to its title better.
It all gets back to that suspension of disbelief. Are you willing to make the leap?
The long-winded explanations and clumsy performances are made worse by graceless effects and a last-minute 3-D conversion that wrecks whatever visual grace or beauty might have been there.
"At times it's so mind-numbingly dull, it becomes funny. But it's not a feature film. I'm not really sure what it is."
Avoid this one like the pox.
It ends up feeling as stale as week-old bagels and lox.
"A very simple and pleasing take on themes like discipline, dedication and effort. [Full review in Spanish]"
Its disposable nature belies a much better film lurking in there somewhere.
"Dull and drab, with a lack of imagination"
"Our sympathies gradually shift from feeling sorry for the character and her dilemma to feeling sorry for this appealing actress, swimming against the current in murky waters."
"""In Secret"" is like watching one of those gritty film noir melodramas from the 1940s, only set in 1860s Paris - and, unfortunately, without much of the edge of those earlier, set-later predecessors."
"Before Midnight convinced us that Linklater had become one of the most emotionally mature filmmakers of his generation. With Everybody Wants Some!!, he has a lame midlife crisis."
You'll be looking at your watch for a merciful end.
It's a pity that all this exposition is written with such clunkiness that it would make George Lucas yelp.
"Jeff Daniels' issues are self-indulgent. But to him, his writer's block and insubstantial life are epic, and the film sides with him more often than not."
"The Covenant is a terrible movie, a bucket of water on the teen-witch genre."
"There's a lot of loud action. There are a lot of flashy visuals. Everything goes by quickly. It's just that, like Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, it's not a hell of a lot of fun."
Watching Grave Encounters 2 becomes an exercise in trying to find something you haven&#8217;t seen before&#8212;in other words&#44; an exercise in futility&#46;
"Hannibal Lecter has long been a hot marketing product, but `Red Dragon' turns him into a veritable tchotchke."
"Garlin's directing has little pacing, and many of the borderline gags could have been salvaged with some sharper editing. And there's a shocking amount of jokes and situations that just don't work."
"Miyazaki's hordes of animators haven't penetrated beyond the skin; the moving creatures feel inarticulate and jerky, almost weightless, particularly when played against painterly background mattes."
"Less star-crossed lovers, more impossible physics."
There is no reason why They're Watching needed to be found footage. And there's no reason for anyone to watch it.
"Uneven superhero film is wacky but violent, dark."
"Engineered to provide the same level of entertainment as a sugar rush, this frantic teen (pre-teen?) fantasy has the feel of something concocted in a lab specializing in energy drinks and peachy complexions."
I can't help looking at this as an indictment of the high school football system.
"The Master of Disguise is full of jokes, but just about the only one that provokes widespread giggles from the short-pants set is the villain's tendency to have his maniacal laughing fits cut short by inadvertent toots of flatulence."
The film is based on a very small book of the same name that's illustrated with stick figures. Director Donald Petrie's film miraculously manages to be even less detailed.
The accolades currently pouring in for this Fosse-derived piece of claptrap only prove that American musical theater is dead as a doornail.
Sports movie carefully sidesteps the issue of race and stereotypes
What makes The Last Thing He Wanted ultimately so frustrating (while also elevating it a few notches above its awfulness as a thriller) is the fact that there are things it does quite well.
"Unfortunately, Zack Snyder's stylish but substance-challenged adaptation only skims the surface of this groundbreaking book."
"Devotees of conventional horror films may find some value, but The Cellar hasn’t much to offer the general viewer."
"But it also ends with a sentimentality I didn't buy - the Bellas don't seem to particularly care about each other outside of a competitive setting, so why should we?"
"Brisk take on how Valerie Plame Wilson and her husband, diplomat Joe Wilson, react when her cover as a CIA spy is blown in the debate over the Iraq War."

"Boorman puts a lot of heavy concepts into Zardoz, but seems uncertain whether he takes them seriously himself."
The movie owes an apology to the audience for its compulsive insistence on explaining itself ad nauseam until there's nothing to think about and all that's left is mayhem.
"While the acting and writing are good and the film hits the right emotional notes early on, after that it simply isn't that compelling or interesting."
"Mildly entertaining at best, don't expect it to contribute to your own quest for contentment."
"Berry gives it her all, screaming and wailing and swerving her way through the movie."
"The Fourth Protocol is a good, old-fashioned thriller. Which is what is wrong with it. Movies have come in from the cold war now, yet ""Protocol"" in essence lukewarms up the format. "
It's no accident that Korine's visual style mimics that of a scratchy old VHS tape. There's a name for the genre he's now working in -- it's called glorified public-access TV.
"It's like Kenny Rogers said, ""You've got to know when to walk away""."
There is no shortage of performers with comic skills in A Mighty Wind. What's lacking instead is a visible premise for the satire and ridicule.
Every attempt at horror and suspense is so shockingly inept Piranha 3DD might actually be hilarious if it wasn't so pathetic.
"Seemingly intended as a Buñuelian farce, the pitiful animal effects and erotic scenes instead provoke derision."
"Stallone does seem to think that just getting all his old buddies to lumber up in the one place, as if opening some new branch of Planet Hollywood, is enough to earn our sentimental indulgence."
"At 160 minutes, it's too long. And this isn't exactly brainy fare. If you think too hard about this dopey science-fiction thriller, you'll surely find fault with its physics and similarly sketchy plotting."
Some nebbish 18-year-olds may be inspired by Alan's transformation into a party animal. Others may find it sickening.
"Other than its Nordic setting, The Wave has nothing new to offer the genre, lifting its entire structure from any number of volcano or earthquake films we've seen dozens of times already."
"Long Weekend had all the tools to make a wistful, escapist romance that explores and overcomes some of the stigmas of mental health, but it flatlines."
"If you're hoping for intricate plotting, suspense or even nominal character development, StreetDance 2 is unlikely to waltz away with your heart."
"There's no madness here, no burning, no desperate search for transcendence, no sense of characters on a heroic, continent-crossing quest. Just another sticky, stinky story of boys, being boys. And refusing to become men."
Mark Wahlberg looks yummy in tight leather pants and that's a good thing because there's not much else to recommend . . . ROCK STAR.
"Instead of following one story arc, it takes up several, and that proves to be the film's undoing in the long run."
This collection of eight mini-sermons falls flat.
"The migraine-inducing visuals and game-heavy dialogue -""I can use this trap card to summon Stardust Dragon, and now he's going to attack with cosmic flare"" - will leave most non-fans clawing their eyes out."
An unfunny nanny who outstays her welcome.
Douglas is hurling all of his oddball ticks and psychotic charms into a vacuum.
"No matter how hard he tries to connect the dots, however, the analogy remains as stretched as Elvis' late-career stage clothes."
A lifeless game of cat-and-mouse-and-jaguar.
Brother Bear is a very mild animated entry from Disney with a distinctly recycled feel.
Mall cops everywhere should sue. The movie is trash.
The movie goes from being another mildly depressing lump of unrealized comic potential to being an actively unpleasant experience.
"True Lies, far too technologically bloated for its cartoony plot, overestimates the human tolerance for high-tech mayhem."
"It's certainly a film that's cruel to disagree with, but for all the goodwill and positivity it brings, there's a hollow, gimmicky quality left behind that doesn't sit well when the picture starts to take matters seriously."
"If watching cartoon characters spout four-letter words is your thing, this might well be the greatest movie ever made."
"So The Homesman has women in it, but a 'feminist western'? No."
Think twice before buying the hype. This Flight wouldn't be a tragedy to miss.
"A tepid, lifeless, endurance test of a film that you'd gladly spend an eternity in the desert to avoid ever sitting through again."
A monotonous and misguided sexual thriller that certainly doesn't cater to the typical Friedkin vibes. And Caruso left his top-rated critically-acclaimed ABC-TV cop show for this?
"Unfortunately, an abbreviated running time seems to have been the studio's primary concern, with...an infuriatingly truncated ending that appears to be missing about 30 minutes worth of plot"
"Predictable double-cross piles on predictable double-cross, leading to a conclusion so shocking, you could have knocked me over with a wrecking ball."
"Man, ""Baggage Claim"" is terrible."
"Though handsomely mounted and efficiently staged, this mass of firefighter cliches swings wildly between heartstring-tugging melodrama, testosterone-fueled action and buddy comedy, weighed down by too many predictable twists and storytelling contrivances."
Children of the Corn never justifies its existence&#44; though beneath the corn&#44; the creature feature heart shines through&#46;&#10;&#10;
Weird combination of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and a Holocaust drama is (almost) saved by Jeff Goldblum's commanding lead performance.
Jet Li deserves better than this.
Commie paranoia rampant!
A feature length production of stale dialogue with a weak protagonist.
Paris Hilton puts more effort and thought into her alibis.
...the stretch to feature length hasn't done the material any favors.
"The old adage holds true - if you can't say something nice, ""Don't Say a Word."""
"The actors pull the material as taut as they can, but the story still sags in the middle."
It's hard to imagine why you'd want to pay to be talked down to and coddled like a baby.
...a clumsy hybrid of romantic comedy and New Age infomercial that plays like the weirdest driver's education film you've ever seen.
Dead on arrival.
"Marty"" remade by Jim Jarmusch, ""Jack Goes Boating"" is a long dip in a pool of New York working-class-romantic angst."
"I Spy something lazy, slow, shallow, stupid, amateurish, unfunny, unsuspenseful, uninformed, unspeakably dull and witlessly written, directed and acted."
"What's bothersome is the overall ethic of the film, the notion that every character needs to be outrageous, that any comical situation should be pushed nauseatingly far beyond plausibility, and most significantly, that the audience are a bunch of idiots."
"Midnight Special represents another disappointing entry in Jeff Nichols' filmography, one that suffers from his usual list of problems, including a lacking narrative, poor character development, and shoddy pacing."
This is a film that misses the boat right from the start through an improper mixture of fools.
"What a more interesting film this would have been had Levinson found a way to integrate the past and the present so that one informed the other. As constructed, however, he's made a lopsided movie."
"Compelling story, but WWI-era math biopic needs more zest."
The blandly staged film misses a great opportunity to draw insightful and memorable character portraits of the kind virtually ignored in mainstream moviemaking.
"As the film picks up momentum, however, it becomes the story of an aimless young man who discovers his own brilliant wit and learns how to use it. As he gets closer to the scathing, fearless Moliere we know and love, so does the movie."
An all out attack on the eyes and ears...
"After Superintelligence, Tammy, Life of the Party and The Boss -- all directed by Falcone for his wife -- this is another hit-and-miss effort, not quite hitting as much as it misses."
"The set-up's better than OK, but the black comedy premise never develops into anything remotely interesting. The piece staggers along like a third-rate fringe play, with increasingly pointless fantasy sequences."
Old soul Nikita Mikhalkov's appropriation of the 12 Angry Men template is a bloated series of harangues that feels too long even before its full 154 minutes have shuffled by.
"If you're the most undemanding romcom fan then this might hold your attention, but for everyone else this is a big fat disappointment."
About as cool as the fake rock music they used to play in Brady Bunch episodes when Greg and Marcia went to school dances.
"The Alamo is further, sobering proof that every dog(gerel) has its day and every generation gets the movie it deserves."
The fact that the thought of part three is even a possibility is probably the greatest mystery of all; one not even the famously chiseled title character herself could figure out.
I daresay that even a splinter in the eyeball would be less painful than sitting through this debacle.
Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul is a road trip movie that trips over every terrible family movie cliche with pacing so bad it made 91 minutes feel like a lifetime.
A none-too-winning blend of the unsettling and the unsurprising.
Fist Fight is a mixed bag. The film is amusing without ever becoming the side-splitter it obviously wants to be.
There&#8217;s a certain artificiality to how Mothering Sunday presents itself&#44; never quite moving beyond a dramatic perspective that earns the attention the story should deserve&#46;
Stuff that goes on in this movie is illegal nowadays.
The casting is off&#44; with Jennifer Lopez continually outshining Josh Duhamel&#46;
A jumbled mess...a mediocre idea ineptly executed except for the visuals.
"At a time when we're seeing a shocking resurgence of anti-semitism, this film might have delivered an eye-opening jolt, but instead it feels bloodless and semi-detached."
"There really ought to be a lot more movies like Hit & Run, but only if they're just a little bit better."
An underwhelming experience despite stylish cinematography and a brave performance by Rachel Weisz.
Ultimately a Hitchcock-inspired thriller without too many real thrills.

All of the familiar urban stereotypes and clichés are out in force.
Besson's script is tonally all over the place.
"Frustrating and mediocre, and not the Unbreakable sequel many fans have waited 18 years for. McAvoy impresses once again, however the lack of narrative rigour makes it hard to care."
Downey was having his annual screening of Syriana and decided Stephen Gaghan was the perfect person to come on and direct a film about an eccentric doctor who talks to animals.
What...you're expecting Hamlet?
Nothing much happens and when it does (possibly in Gilderoy's head) it's completely bemusing.
"""Gemini Man"" is a case in which an awful lot of effort has gone into making an awfully lazy action movie."
"All surface and no heart, no brains, no guts. (spoiler review)"
"Bizarrely, the film plays out almost the entire set as a kind of filler, while also trying to cram in enough emotional resonance to fulfill an audience's expectation for sweet-laced closure."
Southeast sizzle and undercover-cop cool are kept to such a minimum that Miami Vice may as well have been transferred to St. Louis.
"If we had a better sense of what was at stake, the characters and their various plights might have taken on more meaning"
"The film's last shot is a gasp-inducing long look at Hamilton triumphantly skimming across a wave for what seems like minutes. In the end, that ride isn't worth the work it takes to get there."
"Represents a lost opportunity to give children, not to mention adults, a movie experience that would widen their eyes as the justly beloved Rowling books did."
"Suspiria is nothing if not ambitious, but when a film tackles such a broad swath of heavy topics, it becomes difficult to treat each one with the weight it deserves."
"In attempting to subvert our expectations of the genre, The Sleepwalker concerns itself with formal details and momentary pleasures that cannot mask the film's regrettable lack of thematic depth."
Technically perfect but wholly uninteresting...
"A mildly intriguing, yet ultimately detached and pitiless portrait of psychopathy."
The kind of Masterpiece Theater-type film that does its level best to bland us into a pleasant slumber.
"Teenaged girls behaving badly, depicted with a positive vibe. Progress? Turns out grossout movies don't work even when they're kind of feminist."
"It's one thing to ask an audience to love a mechanical man, but quite another to love a mechanical performance."
Santa slasher flick sticks to genre template while Jaime King works overtime to make us care about the person gunning for ol' St. Nick.
"A post-modern romantic comedy Caligula: a celebration of unforgivable behavior with a cast that surely, SURELY must have had something better to do."
"For me, this has always been a series of films that, other than a couple of inventive kills and one insanely choreographed opening sequence, has always been more or a less a waste of time."
"So clichd that, at one point, they literally upset an apple cart."
"[Director Patrick Brice] does not put much effort into making the plot believable, or creating suspense. [Full review in Spanish]"
"This Means War finds all new ways to insult 50% of the world's population. Women, hey? Who needs 'em? Not men, that's who! Until they do, I guess"
The greatest waste of A-list talent since Garry Marshall made his last film.
The film feels too insincere and hypocritical to take genuinely seriously on its theme of social injustice.
"It's just another grumpy-old-men grousefest with a gooey center, like The Sunshine Boys or The Bucket List. Even its musical nostalgia comes off as more concocted than felt."
"A minor entry in the director's canon...while not horrible, it might make you a little restless yourself."
"For a film about the Manson family, the most surprising thing about Mary Harron's Charlie Says is that it's actually pretty bland"
"Basically a live-action version of the cliche country-western song with a man down on his luck and losing everything in his life, it comes close to being a joke about itself."
"The problem is that Dima and his foil Perry are about an inch deep. One is driven by fear for the safety of his family, the other is a decent Englishman. Get past that, and there is not much else going on. The locations... are nice, though."
Here's our homage to the film's tortured permutations of the numerals 2 and 3: 3 minus 2 equals 1. And there is only one reason to see this movie: You have absolutely nothing better to do.
"It's a confusing, awkward picture, though Man has its fair share of compelling incidents. Just not nearly enough of them to make the effort shine."
"It sounds grisly, and at times the twee picture postcard Parisian milieu (street-lit cafes; padlocks on the Pont des Arts) drifts into snore-inducing cliche."
Lady in the Water isn't just another disappointment. It's a jaw-dropping catastrophe -- a picture so wrong-headedly intoxicated with itself you view it through an embarrassed haze.
"somewhere in Asia a few years back, a fruit fly passed gas and unwittingly began an inexorable string of circumstances that has now resulted in Ashton Kutcher becoming a star."
"Here Today is a tonal mish-mash that wants to make you laugh until you cry - and then make you cry for real, because Crystal has feels."
The debate over which is the season's worst movie is finally over.
"""Antlers"" is merely a jumbled presentation of awful things, the bones of a good idea with none of the meat."
"The stiffness in the writing and general lack of subtlety leave this feeling underwhelming and overwrought. As a moral fable, The Forgiven offers little genuine critique."
"As an experiment in Academy Award psychology, ""Albert Nobbs"" is fascinating. As drama? It is, forgive us, a drag."
"""The Judge"" is barely watchable because of Downey Jr.'s droll performance."
Vincere goes farther as an irrepressible howl of rancor to the past. [Full review in Spanish] 
I can't help but feel they're just trying to give us a sexy girl version of The Skulls.
More like Headache-Inducing Henry.
"A sometimes wickedly funny but ultimately sour, loud, draining tale of one of the most dysfunctional families in modern American drama."
"Rote blandness... A soapy melodrama meant to be creepy rather than outright 'scary.' like Final Destination without the ingenuity, mixed with Riverdale without the sex."
"Does anyone need these films, apart from the most addicted comics obsessives, and Stan Lee's financial advisers?"
The idea of the story got too big... and he [David O. Russell] overstuffed it. 
"Siberia not only contributes nothing... as entertainment nor to Keanu's career, but it is unnecessarily boring. [Full review in Spanish]"
A hollow viewing experience where there are just no stakes.
"It often plays like an exercise in image management, treading lightly on explosive autobiographical terrain from his adult life, but going deep on family trauma (particularly the childhood death of his brother Wesley) and tales out-of-school."
"Toys with the notion that keeping mum is often best policy, but the movie's ugly photography threatens to sink the story."
"Hobo With a Shotgun reminded me of Hatchet, another inexplicable genre favorite that, from where I sat, seemed to do little but rearrange genre tropes to get a Pavlovian rise from its niche audience."
A solid if unnecessary and compromised remake of the 1972 existential hitman thriller...
I imagined this is what Breaking Bad would have been like without any likable characters or roller coaster highs (pun intended) in action and drama.
Relatively unknown actors defeated by a ridiculous script full of inane coincidences. Sappy to the nth degree.
"A naughty throwaway in all senses of the word throwaway -- 90 minutes of talented performers doing and saying dumb, crude stuff in pursuit of an elusive laugh, in a disposable action-comedy..."
"Preposterously baroque...[but] can serve as a visually intriguing guilty pleasure peopled by very photogenic young things, all of them gorgeously photographed."
Charlie Bartlett is a teen movie that only wants approval from adults.
"The film glorifies incompetence, in part by terrorizing you with it."
"A thriller that's dated, pointless and sludgy slow (even clocking in at 76 minutes)."
"We watch them trudge for miles, growing tired of listening to the squeaky wheel of a wagon."
[Director] Trank is so busy fashioning [Wiesenthal] as a superhero that little light is shed on the man's relentlessness and his stubborn determination to keep his data center in Vienna even under siege from a shabby Austrian smear campaign.
"Oh, how 'The Man With the Iron Fists' longs to be 'Kill Bill.' It isn't, but its environments, blood-letting and martial arts, along with an interesting score and soundtrack, make no bones about its filmmakers being Quentin Tarantino devotees."
It kind of broke my heart.
A corporate-sponsored disco rave from the happiest recesses of hell.
"The performances offer much to admire, while the story fails to provide the chilling intensity it so clearly wants to generate."
"Spencer isn't quite gaudy or excessive enough...and in this way, pales in comparison to Larraín's last couple projects which addressed similar ideas more creatively."
"Oh Sandra Bullock, why do you do this to yourself?"
"Reminiscent of being forced by your proud, if tipsy, aunt to watch a shaking-camera home movie of a cousin's poorly-recorded school play or chorus recital."
"At third blush, after I thought about what I'd seen, the premise never had a chance of working out well in the hands of filmmakers whose take on their subject is sitcom-deep."
"They may look like goggle-wearing cartoon versions of the psychrotrophic Paxil, but they don't ease depression, they just cause it."
Where is this leading? Will the next Banning film be Vegan Has Fallen?
"It's as if Crowley, a theater director, took Pulp Fiction as his guide without understanding its appeal."
"There's a plague in this screenplay, mainly in the Winkler character and the actor's performance."
"A tasteless, breathless Hello-tastic romance that plays fast and loose with the facts. Any more creepily reverential, and it would be curtseying."
A lackluster sequel to a lackluster original...
"While his visual take on the life of J.M.W. Turner's is among Leigh's most ambitious attempts, outside of a few key scenes and good performances, the film lays lifeless like a PBS special on a Sunday afternoon."
"What on the surface looks like a plush period piece with best picture aspirations, is actually a bland biopic of an otherwise interesting figure in Amelia."
"If you know someone who is thinking of putting their kid though one of these programs, buy them a ticket. If not, what's the point?"
There's no real dramatic thrust.
"What's cringe-worthy about ""Trafficked,"" directed by Will Wallace, is how unnecessarily eroticized it is, like something from the made-for-video bin in a '90s-era Blockbuster."
YPOM delivers enough of the goods to fans of &#8220;upbeat and passable if you don&#8217;t think about it too much&#8221; rom-coms&#46; They aren&#8217;t high art &#40;or even medium art&#41; but they do serve a purpose and enough people watch them to ensure they&#8217;ll never stop being made&#46;
"Ironically, one ends up feeling both skeptical and cynical about this movie that wants to have it both ways but, instead, ends up just as deeply cynical and flawed as its characters and the system it seeks to expose."
More of a foolish plod than a weightless rollick.
Good-natured but only memorable as a platform for the amusingly feisty Peter Falk.
Straw Dogs deeply shocked and unnerved me...watch at your own peril.
De Palma doesn't seem to know what to do with these actors.
"Our hero is Marcus Flavius Aquila, a Roman soldier played by Channing Tatum, an absurdity from which the film never remotely recovers."
"Well, let's go ahead and outlaw video game adaptations right now."
"There is, however, little socio-political insight into the Dionysian revolution depicted here; the film seems to serve more as a nostalgia piece than anything."
"Formidable, if incoherent, action-packed thriller, filled with dastardly double-crosses, greed and revenge."
The Purge: Election Year represents writer/director James DeMonaco's attempt to squeeze one more movie out of a premise that has run dry.
Swing Vote isn't inspirational as much as it's simply afraid to take a stand on anything.
"22 minutes of sitcom entertainment, padded out to a long 90 minutes"
Mostly an excuse for cramming as much gratuitous violence as possible into a PG-13-rated flick running only 92 minutes.
"an 'if only I had...' nostalgic romance... even the appealing performances of Danes, Wilson and Gummer are not enough to make up for a ponderous story that assigns each of its characters a predictable fate..."
"Given the talent involved on both sides of the camera and its sturdy literary pedigree, there's no way a movie could be this doughy and airy unless it was somehow by design."
"The film is framed, too unquestioningly, as a transgender Rebel Without a Cause, with Brandon the martyred innocent who dies for her infatuations."
A woefully underwritten motion picture that starts out as a dumb comedy before taking an ill-advised detour into mawkish sentimentality.
"The concept of beauty being only skin deep is referred to several times, yet is buried under the unrelentingly unpleasant parade of ""rhino"" gags."
"The visuals and concepts presented here may be compelling and vital, but director Luc Jacquet weaves them together with too little urgency, propulsion and, ultimately, unique sense of purpose."
"It has a fascinating central character and the right actor playing him, with an excellent supporting cast (Michael Gambon? Alec Baldwin? Timothy Hutton? All great.). But it hasn't figured out where to take the story."
A more self-indulgent piece of movie-making is hard to imagine.
"The film is dark, and a bit slowly paced in parts, but it's worth watching."
It is as soft as a withered flower and slowly plants the seed of boredom within me. [Full review in Spanish]
"In the end, though, the film feels cheap and used up -- like watching a two-hour Hallmark special."
Teaching boys that pretending they're not afraid so they can take charge of every situation = literally every single problem on earth right now. So let's stop doing that.
Belongs more in the category of missed opportunity than the successful caustic social commentary it so desperately wants to be.
Running Free is the only evidence anyone will ever need to demonstrate what a ruinous trend wallpapered narration has become.
Yet another American thriller with little to engage the brain.
"Beyond Mirren's performance, there's not really much reason to see this film."
Only when there's an opportunity to blow things up does Fuqua seem fully engaged.
"An intermittently arresting, mostly standard action entry that deals death noisily more than cleverly - a lot like the original."
Statham has at least three more movies coming out this year. I bet at least one of them will be better.
"If you've never seen the 2008 version, many twists and turns of the new ""Martyrs"" might engross you in a superficial way. But why bother with a muted copy, when you can experience the balls-to-the-wall original?"
"The pic's chills are top-notch, but its underlying mockish tone won't please die-hard fans."
"The main relationship is between Lara and her father, and that gets a little icky after a while....Want excitement and suspense? There's more of that in the first seven minutes of Raiders of the Lost Ark than there is in the entirety of this movie."
"The movie really is star-studded, but it has almost no momentum. "
Mystifyingly overrated horror flick that moves like fire hydrant in winter
"All that could redeem this thoroughly foreseeable unfolding would be colorful characters and good acting. Everybody's Fine comes close, but not close enough."
"Though it's not a great film by any means, director Patricia Riggen extracts a fair few moments of inspiration and brilliance from the mountain of sanitized mush that is The 33."
Ugh. Just ugh.
"This excruciatingly bad attempt at a breezy romcom is an ill-conceived, dreadfully executed mess. Totally bereft of laughs, drama and chemistry between the leads, the movie is so nausea-inducing that it belongs in a sub genre of its own - the vomcom."
"Once Tom Hooper's 110 minutes of Cats are over, theater is dead. One lucky Jellicle cat is dead. And we unchosen ones are left, tragically, to continue living."
Don't be fooled by the subtitles and the egg head accolades. This pretentious mess is just another country's version of 50 Cent-style fare.
There&#8217;s no nice way to say it&#58; this movie looks cheap&#46;
There's really no reason to go see Tower Heist when you can watch Ocean's Eleven on TNT again.
Oh for the days when Verhoeven was still in Holland.
"Shareef don't like it and neither will you. (Full Content Review - Sex, Violence, Profanity, etc. - for Parents also available)"
"It's clich-ridden, wildly incompetent, and laughably serious about itself. But if you saw it at the right age, and if you approach it in the right frame of mind, it's a pretty easy way to kill a couple of hours on TBS."
"Another day, another Bruce Willis direct-to-DVD effort that continues the odd, sad decline of his career."
Catch and Release is a little one that gets away.
"The result is a work that is filled with interesting moments, but ultimately succumbs to conventional plot devices that the real Tolkien would have scoffed at."
An unquestionably dismal look at the wealthy teen's life in the mid-'90s.
"""2012"" is yet another example of technological genius and story-telling mediocrity."
Dom Hemingway suffers from a meandering narrative and inconsistent comedy.
"Posh boarding school is so short of funds the headteacher allows fracking to commence in the neighbouring wood, little knowing that the resulting tremors would release some nasty beasts from under the ground."
There are some laughs to be had in Dirty Grandpa if you're 13-years-old or have a sense of humor that hasn't developed far beyond that.
Hedge's script never seems willing to fully immerse itself into the darkness. It is content with simply dipping its toes in at various points.
"Its heart is in the right place and it really focuses on the insecurities women can face with regards to body image and the need to be seen as perfect, but its delivery leaves much to be desired."
"The effects look cheap, the action scenes are unmemorable, and the plot regularly blows up its own tension-and the audience's interest-with missiles raining ignorantly down from the heavens."
An overly familiar affair that will strain young attention spans with its plodding lessons about greed (it's bad) and nature (it's good).
Life is far too short for bad movies!
"Time was when I looked forward to, well, sinking my teeth into a good scary vampire film."
"[Rock's] high notes are higher than ever, his penchant for uproarious comedy intact, but his cinematic voice remains inexplicably lost in the din."
"Working from a screenplay by William Monahan, Scott takes rusty '80s clichés from the days when we were playing nuclear chicken with Russia and retrofits them to the post-9/11 world. He exposes how weary those old spy tropes really are."
"Occasionally energetic, but primarily frantic, Boy appears more fascinated with melodrama than investigation, mashing down Lennons surprisingly complex adolescence into a flavorless paste."
Forget the dogs; who let this movie out?
"An extraterrestrial-futuristic western that seems directed by a bad Jodorowsky impersonator. And I can't stand the original Jodorowsky, so..."
"""Third Person"" makes a valiant attempt at being a continuation of Haggis' love for storytelling and multi-layering, but it falls flat --- not having the panache necessary to keep it compelling."
"Instead of lean, nasty genre entertainment, it's a weighty, overly complicated two-and-a-half hour slog with occasional bright spots that serve as a reminder of the movie's squandered promise."
"""The Cell"" looks spectacular. If only it never opened its mouth."
"Every Thing Will Be Fine is a title meant to put you at ease, but a movie that'll likely put you to sleep."
At least it might work as inspiration for DIY film-makers to prove they could do better.
Five leading men head into the jungle with $$ in their eyes. Not all of them return.
"The acting is not the problem. It rarely is. And, within parameters, the movie is not dull. Just don't expect to feel much short of guilt in response to your own apathy."
"Good Night, and Good Luck. isn't memorable, even in the short run, because it creates a desire for information that Clooney has no intention of fulfilling."
"If my life was made into a film it would be this one. Long, boring, occasionally pretentious and completely uninvolving."
"It's not even that the film shifts wildly in tone as much as the fact that none of those tones work at all: the horror parts aren't scary and, surprisingly for Smith, the comedy bits aren't funny."
"Empathetic and yet ultimately too draggy to elicit much engagement with its paper-thin story, ""Elizabeth Blue"" proves at once well-intentioned and inert."
"At 84 minutes, the movie feels both overpadded and underdeveloped."
It's a blatant attempt for the director to revive his box office fortunes by blowing up parts of the White House Complex as gaudily as he did 18 years ago.
"Women are not given a chance to lead action movies as often as they should, so when one like Gunpowder Milkshake underwhelms, it's extra disappointing. The inexperienced filmmakers are unable to make good use of their actors' talent."
"It comes off like a combination of ""The Hunger Games,"" ""Saw"" and Pokemon Go. Maybe that sounds like a good thing. It's not."
"Depressingly predicable to the point of seeming uneventful -- if every scene and emotional beat is visible an act in advance, why bother with a storyline?"
Katniss' concern for the anti-sexy Peeta results in her spending quite a bit of the movie in po-faced mopery.
"Very little here works. The movie is safe and bland, with atrocious direction and horrible choreography."
The film is much too silly to be scary and much too prosaic to be funny.
&#46;&#46;&#46; offers some obligatory twists and turns without digging beneath the surface &#8212; like its tenacious wordsmiths would have done&#46;
An awful remake of George Cukor's witty 1939 The Women.
"A tepid thriller, filled with technobabble..."
" I think I get what she was going for, but I dont think she got there"
"Downey has made only one movie (not counting cameos) that wasn't Iron Man or Sherlock Holmes in the last five years, and it shows. He's so quick, but he's coasting on talent and technique."
Bizarre is the only way to describe it. It's not the thriller the trailer implied.
"The distasteful, often flat Get Hard succeeds only as a testament to the resilience of talent."
"Two hours of shaggy, pointless and often boring film hung on what should have been an editorial about the state of scifi."
"The brief but powerful investigation of Richard Jewell remains a stain on law enforcement and media. But in his eagerness to show how badly they transgressed, Clint Eastwood has prevented his film from being as powerful as it could have been."
Don't be surprised if someone interrupts you in the middle of the film to ask if you understand what's happening on the screen and don't feel bad answering that you do not have the slightest idea. [Full review in Spanish]
[Aronofsky] shoots himself in the foot repeatedly.
Marvel gave a pretty mediocre answer to DC's Wonder Woman with this film but at least the cat was cool.
"It's a film with an obviously limited budget that it uses well when it comes to production design and effects but, in the end, causes the filmmakers to skimp on the story."
Would have been a great movie for kids but that pesky R rating gets in the way.
"A stylishly-edited, often amusing and funny documentary that's too euphemistic and poorly synthesized to be truly enlightening or revelatory."
"Kangana Ranaut walks away with the entire film, playing both Tanu and Kusum with panache, in what is probably the defining female performance of 2015 (in a year already filled with many). Yet, even she cannot salvage this film in the end."
The stars glide through the spotty material finding humanity and the touching moments tucked away in this overly sentimental travelogue.
Blends facts with fiction.
High times in high altitudes doesn't necessarily spark an interest for those not at the party.
"Crisply shot in gritty black and white, Suddenly's forceful visual style just doesn't compensate for its hollow psychological core."
"A delicate piece with good performances and an intriguing enough setup, the drama ultimately doesn't go anywhere definite or distinctive enough to leave a lasting impression."
"An audiovisually complex drama that's better than slick, though it feels pointless-another homage to a kind of filmmaking that's had more than its share."
The end result is indifference and boredom. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Though sensitively acted by Jackson, this solemn sermonette from Rod Lurie struggles to get off the ropes and never quite establishes its rhythm."
"Another failure, proving that the Marvel name no longer guarantees blockbuster box-office..."
"Will Smith has played an alcoholic superhero, a mystical caddie and a fighter pilot on a mission to save the planet from aliens, but Ben Thomas might just be the most unbelievable role of them all."
"Unfortunately, with The Meg, an able cast has little more to do than utter lame wisecracks and look concerned."
"Poorly directed, depressingly dull comedy with hardly any laugh-out-loud moments - a waste of a talented cast."
This third and supposedly final edition in the franchise is nothing more than an uncomfortably transparent contractual obligation.
The Eighties should sue.
The questions the film raises are more interesting than the film itself.
65 million years from now&#44; people will look back and wonder how a 90-minute movie with Adam Driver and dinosaurs never achieved lift-off&#46; 
"Capone is definitely an unconventional take on the twilight of a notorious gangster. Alas, it's not an interesting one, although the borderline self-parodying Method madness of Tom Hardy's performance does kind of demand to be seen."
"The cinematography, the set design, the costumes, the overall feel of Loving: all first-rate. Negga and Edgerton are undeniably good. I was impressed. I just wish I'd been more deeply moved."
"Sorry, this one's just vile."
...an embarrassment to all concerned.
Zombieland: Double Tap lacks the emotional impact that helped to make the original so enjoyable.
"After a visceral opening battle, endless speeches dull good intentions, and the characters lack depth."
Shrek the Third made more than $322 million. Why kill the goose that laid the golden egg? Because it's time.
"Its glossiness is what prevents Schumer from utilising her darkest edges, the same properties that have defined her ongoing comic schtick. Now will the real Amy Schumer please stand up?"
No one will claim it steals that famous old MGM motto: 'More Stars Than There Are in Heaven.'
"They may be archetypes of my peers, but it's really hard to even care."
"It's as phony, stupid, lame, and pathetic as any reality show on television."
"I really love what ""Focus"" is trying to do, which makes it an even bigger bummer that it doesn't succeed."
The film takes the lazy route of cannibalising pop cultural references rather than coming up with decent jokes.
You'll care less about who gets slashed and/or chewed to pieces than about several of the Vikings' stylish beard pigtails.
"McKay's choices keep clashing into one another: He badly wants the film to be another ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" but, having directed the ""Anchorman"" movies and being a political activist, he is equally keen to be taken seriously."
What's left is a kaleidoscope of well-staged episodes - Tolkien on the field of battle surrounded by a circle of dead bodies is harrowing - that often seem more like prettified postcards from midcentury Britain than real-life being lived by real people.
More of a dunce movie than a dance movie.
This is straight-up young people whining about their relationships.
"No one wanted this. Not even lapsed Christians sought to be ""Bourne"" again."
"#ALIVE plays its setting too safe, and while the end product is certainly watchable, it's ultimately nothing special."
"It's lurching, desperate and borderline incomprehensible -- a movie whose characters act according to no known precept of recognizable human behavior."
"I don't know if this is a sequel we need. A strong message for kids, but their parents may get a little bored."
Incredulity grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go.
"Maybe if Singleton didn't try to repeat Boyz N the Hood with Baby Boy, he would've made a better movie."
"It's those small pleasures that make ""French Exit"" worth seeing even when its overall structure doesn't quite hold together."
"Covering tediously familiar territory, this is only enlivened by the appearance of Billy Zane's fashion guru in a grey check tam-o-shanter declaring his love of Yves Saint Laurent."
Perilously close to the pop-culture trash it aims to mock.
The film feels rather like listening to the arsonist calmly explain why he set the fire as we continue to watch it rage.
"Half Nelson certainly sees things in a new way. Unfortunately, it doesn't see them very clearly."
There's just nothing redeeming about this movie...
"Fincher has made a detailed and vivid character study of the writer penning the script of Kane, although his film is flawed by one critical omission - - its failure to give the viewer any genuine sense of what Mankiewicz wrote."
"A badly acted, unoriginal, irritating movie...Easily one of the worst films of 2001."
It stands no chance of being mistaken for a good movie.
Joffe's removal of the story from the classical theatricality of the 1930s to the more contemporary and hip aesthetic of the 1960s just doesn't work in all the ways he may have intended.
"Not everything worked or made sense, but the characters and their problems seemed real."
"Initially suspenseful and has a sexy cast and beautiful scenery that provides lots of eye candy, but the suspense and intrigue fizzle out when its ""whodunit"" mystery ends during the hour mark..."
"Banal, boring and unsatisfying...falters because its premise never really works."
"The fact that the movie is literally dull comes as a surprise, especially with the usually reliable Spielberg at the helm."
Comes at us with a regrettably dim script and very uncertain style from gimmick-fond director Rodrigo Cortés
It appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept.
"should have been a frothy farce, but instead takes several different attitudes, including action, melodrama, and mean-spirited nihilism. None of those are particularly successful"
That the movie is slated for a straight-to-DVD release in the US next year is probably indicative of its cinematic potential. It all feels a little bit sitcommy.
"How do you make such limited characters sustain a full-length movie? You don't. Writers Mike Myers, who plays Wayne, and Bonnie and Terry Turner have compiled a script that is mostly a series of disconnected gags."
Jenny Slate brings charm to a story that otherwise may have been devoid of any realistic or interesting human behaviour.
"Emma Thompson's character comes off as the stodgy Fun Police, rather than an author trying to protect her work."
"Lots of photogenic folks serve up white whine, usually weak laughs, or suddenly candid chats with strangers. The Hollywood contrivances are cringing. Dundering in its efforts to melt your heart to slush."
"It's mostly a familiar, if not entirely fruitless, trudge down a well-trodden path, one that takes us into, at times, questionable territory."
I can hardly call Bullet to the Head bad; it's just so bland on pretty much every level that there's not much to say but 'meh'.
A markedly different kind of movie.
"Turnout is well acted and nicely paced, but it struggles to find the right tone and it's ultimately let down by an unlikeable lead character, the occasional snatch of dodgy dialogue and some irritating script problems."
"Treu scores his finest points off the little kids' unfailing cuteness, but the film's broad performances and heavy-handed moralizing strike a note of condescension."
"So the visionary efforts are present, absolutely, but they’re not memorable without a consistently compelling narrative."
Lock them all up and throw away the key is what I say.
"Haneke without the soul, and if you've seen enough of that man's pictures, you can maybe perceive how unsettling the idea of a soulless Haneke sounds."
A series of striking images that serve little purpose except to look striking.
"We cringe honestly, dismayed by such cinematic tunelessness."
"Every time critics are ready to declare the hyper-violent buddy-cop movie is dead, along comes a movie like ""Stuber"" to show the genre is still alive, though just barely."
Why do Jurassic Park sequels think we&apos;re here for the idiot humans and not the dinosaurs&#63;
"A divergence for the eyes and little else, the movie has the ability to stay with you for about as long as its slim 84-minute running time, and then exits from your memory."
"Shrug off the recycled script and the movie's trite if uplifting, message and recognize the signs of stardom to come. It won't be too many Sundays before David E. Talbert finds his funny film niche and Katt Williams becomes a top billed star."
It's a dire and overlong period movie that manages to display a good deal of prurience and misogyny.
"It's not Shakespeare, but it's all over before the average 3-year-old with a 16-ounce Hi-C will feel the urge to pee, and that is an art all its own."
"The mishaps are mostly misfires, and the situations all feel contrived."
"One has to admire the spirit of this independent production, which aims for the sweeping spectacle of 'El Cid', but it falls way short of its epic ambitions."
Curdled gobs of antic shtick.
The real problem with Rampage is that it fails to really commit. It should have been either considerably less dumb or a LOT dumber.
"What could be one of [Roman] Polanski's trademark alienated creatures comes off as little more than a pathetic, self-pitying jerk under Simon Hesera's direction."
Camp X-Ray seems more outraged by military sexism than the notion that Gitmo remains open in the Age of Obama.
"t's hard to sit back and embrace the chaos of ""The Last Knight"" when you can think about similar big-budget action tentpoles ... and reflect on how even in all their craziness, they just made a lot more sense."
"Between long stretches of TV clips from real-life games, ponderous melodrama unfolds."
"Scene-by-scene, things happen, but you'd be hard-pressed to say what or why."
"This is not a movie that sparks questions about the meaning of life. Well, maybe one: Dude, where's my Zen?"
Julianne Moore currently essays maybe the most obnoxious white woman in a Hollywood movie since Erin Brockovich.
"There's not much zest here, even with Mike Myers's energetic attempts to steal the movie."
"A romantic comedy that will make you hate both romance and comedy... oh, and also women."
Peter Berg's rugged version of the worst environmental disaster in American history is very effective. So why did I feel so guilty enjoying it?
"The final parts of this movie are the kind that you'd swear were slapped on by the studio, until you realise the whole story must have been built around them."
... the script and direction are only haphazardly entertaining.
All these characters with their odd powers are inherently absurd and they throw a barrel of wrenches into the machinery of a coherent narrative.
A strong first act descends into a bloated and frustrating heist film.
The action is strictly routine.
Unpleasantly glib and relentlessly shallow.
The fourth Bat-flick finds this juvenile franchise running on empty.
"Unfortunately, besides the flawless performances I didn't get much else from the film to make it much of a lyrical experience."
"The sense of warm and fuzzy wonder that starts things off doesn't stand a chance against the uneven, badly edited mess that follows"
interesting but ultimately inessential
"Savaged when it was released, is it time for a reconsidering St. Elmo's Fire, a retrograde look at '80s single life? No. No, it's not."
"When Blonsky dances, it's embarrassing."
Disappointing as a whole&#44; Fall nonetheless contains a few memorable sequences that could justify a casual viewing&#46; But don&#8217;t expect to feel much beyond some unsteadiness&#46; 
...low camp...
Both a dispiriting reminder that the MCU has abandoned wit and that even the most clever and idiosyncratic of filmmakers can be steamrolled by the unstoppable obligations of corporate storytelling.
[It operates] only to either telegraph a jump scare with its silence or drown the viewer in a cacophony of noises that are far more annoying than unnerving.
It was never a boring watch but it was a frequently irritating one.
The first half had potential and lost its way completely by the end.
"This is a Happy Madison production, and as such it's exhaustively lazy, outside of its righteous dedication to the valorization of the man-child."
"Eye-catching though both performances are, Byzantium remains an indecisive oddity with Jordan's rhythm of reverie never quite finding its groove."
"When it's over, you may find yourself with a strong urge to eat brioche or foie gras, but at the same time, incapable of describing what the film was about or why it matters."
"By favoring cuteness over credibility, The Terminal ends up being far too fantastical--even for Steven Spielberg."
"I would think that John Boorman, director of Exorcist II: The Heretic, is now officially off the hook. This isn't entertainment; it's assault and battery."
"In cherry-picking the more filmable episodes from the novel, Hamer and Stark have constructed a sort of poor man's Barfly, with an emphasis on drunken mischief."
YPOM delivers enough of the goods to fans of &#8220;upbeat and passable if you don&#8217;t think about it too much&#8221; rom-coms&#46; They aren&#8217;t high art &#40;or even medium art&#41; but they do serve a purpose and enough people watch them to ensure they&#8217;ll never stop being made&#46;
"If there was ever a cinematic vessel that deserved hitting an iceberg and sinking before it hit theaters and subjected viewers to one of the worst comedies in years, if not decades, this is it."
Plenty of melodrama but precious little truthfulness...a very provincial item that probably shouldn't have ventured across the state line.
A derivative and increasingly silly crime thriller.
A ridiculous allegorical story that must be taken literally to be believed even though it's so absurd.
There are at least a couple of disparate movies fighting for control in Summer Storm.
ll along you wonder how a story with so much potential could become a movie with so much wall-to-wall nothing.
"The notion of an affluent white man taking to the streets with a gun to exact some sort of self-styled justice was a bit troublesome even 40 years ago, but in today's climate, it's downright unsettling."
"It starts out as a deft examination of the angst of dating in the age of swiping left and right, and all too soon turns into a film that loses our sympathies as it turns nauseating."
"The Merchant-Ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema, only now it's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage."
"Pleases just about no one, neither the viewers looking for a thoughtful supernatural enterprise nor those out for a good scare."

"The Diary of a Teenage Girl is undeniably bold in its candor, but it leaves us feeling empty."
An Alan Parker potboiler in the tradition of his Angela's Ashes and Come See the Paradise -- more concerned with quickening our pulses than broadening our minds.
Who would have guessed that Jason Reitman would turn into this sort of mediocrity?
A German thriller that isn't shy about ripping off The Silence of the Lambs.
This movie has got to be the preachiest preachy movie I've ever seen preached to me.
"A crass mid-life crisis comedy that becomes an improbable, uneven rumination about love on the rocks."
"A brain-dead piece of slacker swill, worse than the worst Sandler, Schneider or Spade movie ever made."
"It tends to lurch distractingly, as if Mr. Mori were still trying to figure out how to piece the whole thing together."
Annoying
"Filmed in 2012 and finally limping into theaters like a glamorous zombie, the movie has star wattage but zero emotional voltage."
"Come on, pedophilia is funny and a Michael Jackson joke is never not timely, right? Wrong. It's not timely or funny."
"Antebellum, for all it promises in its slick trailers and eye-catching imagery, fails on several levels to ever come full circle in its intent while only worrying about a failed, yet intriguing, twist ending that blindly rushes toward the finish."
"Only the latest in a long line of forgettable, unfunny ""comedies"" in which we're supposed to care about some intrinsically unlikable slob."
"In the end, the power of Minervini's pseudo-fiction gives way to a much blander version of pseudo-reality."
"All the same and despite Cheung's deserved Best Actress win at Cannes, the feigned intimacy with inexpressible bio-emotional conditions like addiction and detox leaves us, as it almost always does, on the outside."
"Helen's chaste swain wants intimacy, not sex. C'mon-even Baptists are interested in sex. They just don't do it standing up, because someone might think they were dancing."
"Five Feet Apart is by first-time screenwriters Mikki Daughtry and Tobias Iaconis, and the lack of experience shows."
The story is very predictable and when that&#8217;s coupled with a very rushed climax&#44; this feels like wasted potential and ends up being an ineffective horror story&#46;

"The mushy script, co-written by Zhang, never rises above that of a TV soap opera."

"O filme se torna entediante a partir do momento em que nossa admiração pela proeza tecnológica alcançada pela Imageworks, criadora do ratinho Stuart Little, chega ao fim."
"A decidedly mixed bag, interesting in some narrative respects and technically strong but hobbled by mediocre songs and one especially irritating character."
"...deserves a swift, kick-in-the-pants goodbye."
A major step backward with an A-list actor in a C-grade military thriller.
Well here's something that you don't have to see.
"When the most endearing character is a mouse corpse dressed in a tiny suit, you suspect that the rest of this Dinner might not agree with you."
"Just when it's supposedly getting to grips with its theme, the movie goes utterly haywire and becomes yet another brainless, humourless bone-cruncher."
"The Swedish trilogy trundles to a wobbly finale that's heavy on plot and cheap theatrics, but light on the dark, mesmerizing energy that made the first film so watchable."
"Bewitched [the show] was unassuming, charming, maybe a little innocent; this movie is smug, patronizing, and a little infantile."
It's as sanitized and closed-off as the carefully sealed room where Katie spends most of her days.
"The moral lesson of ""spend more time with loved ones"" is pretty weak sauce if I'm being honest: It's nothing more than an unheeded warning sign on the edge of the diamond-encrusted road straight to ruin."
I'm not going to beat around the bush here. This is a bad movie.
"""Thelma"" is a fascinating mess of a movie made by a talented filmmaker, but some of the directions this film goes to feel too abrupt and overtly conceived"
"To be absolutely fair, even if Exodus were cast with 100% racial/ethnic authenticity, it would still be a terrible film."
Precious Cargo is a rip-off and a rerun.
"Are the Coens just being smart alecks here, or are they saying something sourly profound about American popular culture?"
"A rather ham fisted look at the information wars, which contains some drama but takes too long to get to the good stuff."
"The tension dissipates. And the final pay-off, which is effectively Wedler trussed up in the world's worst mermaid costume, is a borderline insult."
Exactly the type of inner-city crime drama that HBO's The Wire so expertly exposed as facile fantasy.
"Owen's voiceover is a cringeworthy accompaniment on the film's heavily signposted road to redemptive hugs and Joe's tentative romance with a divorcee. Bereavement is a valid starting-point, but this really gives the healing process a bad name."
"Sausage Party appears to be written by a group of 11 year olds who have just heard curse words for the first time, but have never heard a single joke in their lives."
[Its] portrayal of violence derives more from video games than from history.
"Colin Higgins' movie is a disappointment. Not a fiasco, a disaster or a scandal. But not as funny as it should have been, and not the trenchant office satire one was led to expect. "
The Spider-Man we find at the end of the movie is no different than the one we met at the start...you can't help but feel like he could have learned all of the same things without leaving Queens or wasting our time.
"The characters are flat and indistinct, and the actors lack the ability to give impact to the supposedly shocking revelations about their relationships, let alone do justice to the big ideas at the film's core."
I'm sympathetic enough to Andersson's project and his sensibility to concede after several months of disappointed reflection that Pigeon's redundancy is merely a case of diminished artistic returns than a lazy repackaging job.
"""The Intern"" feels a little bit like the tai chi exercises that Ben does in the park throughout the film - you look for something to react to and laugh at and maybe even shed a tear about, but you wind up pushing against a puff of air."
The movie is pretty cornball.
"The 1981 version certainly isn't high art, but has fun, which is more than can be said for this humorless, dull retelling."
"Divided between time-capsule concert footage ... and backward-glancing interviews - alas, not enough of the former and too much of the latter."
Too many branches for very little forest. [Full review in Spanish]
[The 1951 classic] gets bulked up and dumbed down in a modern remake that repositions the alien Klaatu as a wrathful God rather than a peace-loving one.
"Despite having a perfect cast for a title like Killer Elite, Gary McKendry's feature debut comes across as little more than a generic Jason Statham movie with two high-profile guest stars."
"For an aspiring ultimate trip, Contact has a flimsy dramatic grip."
The Drop drops the ball at every turn&#44; only coming together in the final moments of the film&#44; and by that point the viewer has already checked out&#46;
"Washington and Zendaya do an outstanding job in the setting that they are provided. However, what initially serves as a intriguing dissection of a relationship quickly goes around in circles."
Director Lexi Alexander wants to make a message movie yet also seems attracted by the firms' macho ethics.
"Boring, numbing, unnecessary."
Compounding the problems is the weird confluence of genuine landscape photography with digital animation.
Mostly Rings offers the warmed-up leftovers of a style that hasn't felt fresh since the first George W. Bush administration. It's an unkind rewind.
"Watching the movie is like attending a party you weren't invited to, and where you don't know anybody, and they're all in on a joke but won't explain it to you."
"Aloft has a few serene and gut-wrenching moments, especially when Peruvian director Claudia Llosa tones down her visual poetry to focus on Jennifer Connelly's achingly beautiful performance."
"""Papi Chulo"" tries to subvert the conceit that casts brown people as uncomplicated support systems for conflicted white people, but lacks the vision to transform these familiar stereotypes."
"McKinnon, as always, is an unhinged delight, but she and Kunis just don't have enough chemistry to push this grisly tale of friendship-conquers-all over the hump."
"[The film] has some good sequences in it, is beautifully acted by two actresses who are new to me, is handsomely composed but, at key moments, it's as phony as Soviet neo-realist art. It's of less interest as a movie than as a statement of position."
"Daredevil has a brooding dark and dank air about it, much like Batman. That's about the only element that lends the movie any character."
"Escamilla's photography is distinguished and beautiful, but the film remains lifeless."
"The picture looks good and Dillon does a nice job behind the camera. On the other hand, the film needs to be cut by no less than 20 minutes."
"What slop. Take the Lead is a rotted ground chuck of a movie, made up of the rancid processed parts of a plethora of films, good and bad, that have come before it. At first it seems awfully familiar, and then it just seems awful."
"Smith has a little fiefdom or franchise going, but as Dogma proved, his gift for satire runs south of Mad heading toward 'Jokes for the John.'"
"Supernova meekly goes where other sci-fi flicks, such as Alien, have gone before."
"Well meaning but less than riveting in its execution, this documentary is far better suited for public television exposure than theatrical release."
Trite plot mechanics could be forgiven if it were either funny enough or dramatically weighty enough to be as memorable as the movies it apes.
"The flailing, protagonists of Backseat, while not exactly 40-year-old virgins, can have avoided that fate only by the tender mercies of women with low expectations."
"Fun in spots, undeniably, but a mess on the whole."
"The plot is formulaic, the stereotypes awful, the villain limp and sniffling and the message beyond predictable."
Computer effects have reduced a magnificent animal to a cartoon comic foil with human expressions and a yen for red licorice.
"Where Friedkin produced a polished piece of commercialism, his successors succeed only in alternating hysterics with muddle-headed theology."
The Wash appears not to have much at all on its mind.
"As a critic specializing in scary films, I can honestly say that in the last three years alone there's been several that have impressed me more... I don't get what makes It so special."
"Mansfield Park is a perfectly good adaptation, but it's trite."
"The further the characters venture into the mystic, the more the movie itself seems to dissipate."
No sei o que  pior: o fato do protagonista jamais reconhecer a gravidade de seus atos ou a deciso do diretor em encarar os crimes dos personagens como meros erros juvenis.
"The film's cynicism, like everything else, is nothing more than empty posturing, a fashionable pose adopted to ingratiate itself with a disenfranchised public."
"Bad Lieutenant, Bad!"
Cruella is a dog with a big bark and no teeth to back up its snarl.
"If you haven't seen the original Mary Poppins, then Mary Poppins Returns will probably seem vibrant and new."
"If only the whole script had been as sharp as some of Cusack's caustic one-liners, then this might have appealed to more than just the Chardonnay brigade."
"A cowardly, PG-13 remake for a more timid era, viewing incarceration as a happy playground of product-placement and jokey homosexual panic."
weakly copies Michael Moore's dogged pursuit and film style
I began to feel as if Stone were singling out the 'decent' people of America and making this story theirs alone.
"Good, but a bit of a snorer."
"Though students of formulaic screenwriting may figure this mystery out long before Walter does, there won't be much satisfaction in it because it is totally preposterous."
A totally bubblegum and cotton candy melange of garish fantasy and narcissism.
"Slightly grating, way too long, but not terrible."
If Triggered isn't enough fun for the designer of the carnage to sit through there's little reason for the audience to endure it either.
"Audiences high on popcorn fumes will laugh along at the smut. But, at its core, this is a spiritually empty vessel trying to make a lot of box office noise. Blazing Saddles (1974) or Cat Ballou (1965) it ain't."
"Given a worthy story, Downey's Holmes might have been memorable. Here, he's an interesting character in search of a worthwhile story."
Wendy is a movie founded upon a shallow idea that never evolves.
"Unfortunately, [director Lukas] Moodysson's main attempt to create drama falls flat."
"If you were to tell me that Danny Boyle had told his long-standing First Assistant Director to go make a movie ""in the style of Danny Boyle"", and he had done so, and that the result had been TRANCE, I would've believed you. This is him slumming, badly."
"Turning his story into a Gilliamesque oddity might have looked good on paper, but in aiming for awkward reinvention, this literary adaptation topples under the weight of its lead-footed whimsy."
"...a watchable (but consistently erratic) effort that generally feels like it should be much, much better."
"Case 39 is too bland, with scares that are so polite they almost take their shoes off to avoid dirtying the hallway carpet of your mind."
"""Something's dead out there."" Yeah, like this movie."
"Ever since this elaborate prequel series was kick-started back in 2011, the series' nominal social concerns have consistently been undermined by their slapdash realization onscreen."
"I expect more from Bond, so thumbs down."
"Kiarostami has become the new Kieslowski, an emigrant to Western Europe whose pretentiousness embarrasses the whole concept of art cinema-as proven by Certified Copy."
"If the ongoing meltdown of an obnoxious a**hole's three-quarter-life crisis is your idea of a good time, have at it."
Shows a new level of filmmaking incompetence previously only seen in the films of Dr. Uwe Boll. It is just plain awful
Nobody does quiet despair quite like the British.
Meyers concocts a few madcap comedy situations to break up the otherwise low-key tone&#46;
Just one of those nights at the theatre where you wish you could switch bodies with someone who didn't have to be there.
"It is an overwhelmingly dislikable film, an intensely unfunny and unscary horror-comedy about a serial killer played by Ryan Reynolds on his most irritating form."
"...the movie version that some people said couldn't be made. Well, in all candor, some people were right...You know, there's always a catch."
"The pacing drags through action set-pieces left obscured by messy compositions and limp, over-stylized visual choices. New Orleans, as the film's setting, is wasted while the film's gritty concept fails to deliver the desired intensity."
"The Fourth Kind, despite its periodic strengths, does its very best to take the viewer out of the material rather than immersing one in the story."
"A thoroughly stodgy exploration of the ghosts of the past that has exceedingly little to say about the Vietnam era, the ethics of violent protest or the standards of what's left of the newspaper business."
"This moody, lifeless movie rips off lines, scenes, dream sequences and character kills from Craven's film ... while draining them of energy, suspense and meaning."
"""Bernadette"" isn't exactly a comedy, more like a drama that wants to be whimsical. But it's too heavy to take flight. Maybe this is one of those stories that can't completely make sense as a movie."
"A feel-good celebration of political vigilantism...As a piece of empty-headed action entertainment, it misses the target by a wide margin."
"Apart from anything else, the idea of America having the Spartans' underdog status is not plausible."
"Filled with more explosions per minute than a Michael Bay movie, nearly all of them gratuitous and none of them exciting."
"Anderson, along with partner and star Milla Jovovich, have given the dwindling fans of the series a limp and lifeless simulacrum of what a Resident Evil movie looks like."
Minimizing Piaf's wonderful music diminishes an extraordinary performance by Cotillard. I wanted a concert with the story and didn't get it. Edith would be disappointed.
"Less 300, more 2.99: cheap in every sense of the word but the cost - and all the more glorious because of it."
"Like a scoop of vanilla ice cream atop scoops of chocolate and strawberry, ""The Kissing Booth 3"" rounds out the sugary teen trilogy with a fitting, if bland, finale."
"Live From New York! takes a sweeping but dully corporate view of the comedy institution, yielding almost nothing in the way of revelation or insight."
"If you've ever wanted to see a squeaky-voiced actor get punched in the face, then Fist Fight has your name written all over it."
The first one wasn't all that great. The second one I barely remember seeing.
"The trials Ben and Sadie go through are nothing compared to the obstacle course inflicted on the audience, who has to work very hard to find anything entertaining or enjoyable."
Pre-schoolers may find it diverting but it's all rather strange and unfunny.
"But whatever pretty visuals and thrilling balloon sequences on show are weighed down by dull flashbacks of the duo's personal baggage, eventually deflating The Aeronauts' ability to rise above the material and truly soar."
The casting is all fine; everything else is pushy and out of joint.
Robert Wise brings his Academy Award-winning sobriety and meticulousness to a pulp tale that cries out for the slapdash vigor of a Roger Corman.
"Here, for taking everything so seriously, the only ones who are not going to get bored are the fans of the videogame. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Disturbing, yet unfocused, multi-lingual melodrama..."
"more often than not Andrews' screenplay can't decide if it's a cautionary tale about the perils of marrying a has-been or a rowdy 'you go, girl' celebration of sisterhood."
"Wise's original was an alarming cautionary tale, full of menace and stern warnings. The remake, as befits our times, coddles the audience, assuring us all this bad stuff will eventually work itself out. And hey, let's all go to McDonald's!"
David Lowery's The Green Knight [is] a slog through Arthurian legend that possesses little of the meaning or formal rigor of the director's previous work.
"Unlike A Soldier's Story, which tackled the same theme within the confines of an engrossing, unpredictable story, too much of Hart's War feels like finger-wagging."
All of these mostly middling characteristics coalesce into an ending that viewers will have seen coming since the opening frames&#44; and once again the film frustrates by leading the audience to the precipice of some sort of genuine&#44; earned emotion&#46;
A thriller full of delirium and cheap verbiage that conceals any trace of sense of narrative. [Full review in Spanish]
"The fashionably fussy, funky veneer may convince some that the film's serious, but it's finally another chase pic, murky in detail, muddled in ideology and strangely predictable in dramatic thrust."
"We already have one American Psycho, and sadly for this adaptation of John Niven's book there was no need for a matching British Psycho, even one based in a different industry and played by a hot young thing."
Elsa & Fred is only so-so.
Little more than a string of shop-worn sagebrush sausages.
"Despite thoroughbred work from Dakota Fanning, by the time the movie hits the final furlong it's only good for the glue factory."
"While acknowledging that some of the film's individual scenes are quite funny, the overarching story needed work."
"Hostiles ticks all the boxes of a self-important, would-be epic, and sets them within a film that embodies the bleak=profound attitude so popular in highbrow television series these days."
The Beguiled serves as proof that what goes for naturalism in Sofia Coppola's dominion still verges on being decorative to the point of self-parody.
It never makes the case that a movie about Bob Zellner is intriguing let alone necessary
"You'll find yourself cringing at some of the attempts at gags, with some moments really only evoking a pity laughs as the film moves towards its predictable finale."
"The Sitter runs under an hour and a half, but sitting in a dark theater, forced to watch it, you feel that hours of your life are slipping by."
Director Dror Moreh doesn't rest on his scoop
"The quality of the acting makes it easy to overlook how increasingly leaden ""Stillwater"" becomes - but not easy enough."
"It is beguilingly cuckoo, though as primitive visually as The Twilight Zone - it was shot in 22 days - and about as profound."
"After almost two hours, the repetitive Tag overstays its welcome. Despite some funny moments, it also underuses a great cast and has poor character development."
"What happened to Demme's magic touch, and what is it with this ridiculous casting that never works?"
It doesn't tell us or show us anything new - it doesn't bring anything to the franchise.
Manages to make a travesty of its title subject.
Nearly everything about this film is a cliché.
"The focus always returns to Phoenix, until he turns his back to camera, submerges and literally disappears. Not a moment too soon."
A cancerous pretender promising something different but only offering up crass costumed zeroes
The well-meaning but plodding horror comedy Studio 666 is proof that the Foo Fighters probably should have stuck to music-driven clips.
What disappoints the most is that Luhrmann&#8217;s wild visuals and use of Parker&#8217;s subjectivity &#40;a colossally misguided Hanks performance&#41; don&#8217;t distract from Elvis&#8217; formulaic biopic structure&#46; It&#8217;s the same old story&#44; except bedazzled into an eyesore&#46; 
This half-baked alien invasion comedy is just barely Watch-able.
"A yawn-by-numbers romper-room dud that is nevertheless shrewd enough to tweak its star, Vin Diesel, for becoming a joke in less time than it took him to become an action hero."
An angry movie with a tragic moral ... meta-adoration and criticism ends with a genetically modified dinosaur fighting off waves of dinosaurs.
"Ambitious as hell but irreparably flawed, Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood enthralls for half its run but balances precariously atop an epilogue that can't sustain the picture's dramatic weight."
Anyone who's seen Gibney's superior version will immediately be struck by how false this fictionalized account feels.
"In her [Maya Forbes] insistence on finding the happy ending, Infinitely Polar Bear doesn't find enough of the sadness and pain that would have made such a conclusion earned."
"Time to hang up the boxing gloves, ol' Rocky."
"The film is morbid and mawkish, and packed with enough forced whimsy to make you scream."
"Though beautifully photographed, there's something creepy at the heart of Lila Says."
It's all very third division cole de Richard Curtis.
A hugely watchable film that disappoints nonetheless.
This kid makes Ferris Bueller look like a dangerous radical.
"If this were a well-made film with particularly astounding acting, it might be easier to overlook the predictability of the plot. The script, unfortunately, is actually the least of Waltzing Anna's problems."
"The perfectionist Luhrmann ... captures the exterior excesses of Gatsby's life but overlooks the interior torment that fuels them. Without the latter, Gatsby is less a film and more of a salute to production design."
This drowsy caper comes on like a fun-house mirror of layered pretensions.
"When aunt and niece eventually bond, the moment is truly affecting. But the length of time it takes to get there underscores how thin this story is."
"The plot of the classic adventure tale has been admirably reconfigured to meet modern sensibilities, but the resulting film is simplistic, condescending, and inert."
Reid delivers her lines as though she is calling for another round of Mai Tais for the house.
"It illustrates once again the movie law that the bigger the apocalypse, the less it means."
The overseas setting of this whodunit fails to offset what is basically a lackluster story peopled by unsavory characters.
"Set at a frenzied pace meant to connote fun, it mostly feels like a frenetic spectacle."
"Despite having an abundance of promising ideas, it fails to decide what direction it wants to pursue, leaving everyone lost."
A little more than a hot mess.
"'Mechanic: Resurrection' is a narrative loop, with (supposedly) spectacular scenes that run out of fun from the beginning. [Full review in Spanish]"
A barely coherent story lightly disguised by big explosions and CGI.
Craps out quickly.
"Batwoman is portrayed as strong, capable, and more than an equal match for the Caped Crusader... Yet for all that is good with the film in that regard, it undoes by patronizing and sexualizing these same characters."
"This one, I admit, completely sailed over my head."
... too slight and formulaic to have much of an impact.
How is it that a master filmmaker like Hirokazu Kore-eda can pair with Deneuve and Binoche and make a film this dully melodramatic and uninteresting?
"As a drama, Pride and Glory is too glum, and worse, it doesn't convince."
uneasy but important
"I don't feel so much emotion with this adventure film by Curtiz, in his tenth collaboration with the mythical Errol Flynn, but I can instantly recognize, despite the lack of dynamism, that it has some interesting characters. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Muniz manages to retain his wide-eyed, harried charm, but the film is really a shameful disservice to both him and the family audience which will no doubt turn out in droves to see it."
"With all his devotion to getting the story right -- and that's a worthy goal, don't get me wrong -- Grossman never captures the insanity and terror, or for that matter the seductive allure, of nihilist L.A. punk in its early years."
"Oh, if only dead men told no tales. Then we might have avoided this fifth Pirates of the Caribbean adventure, which fails to justify its own existence in any way whatsoever."
I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy
Nothing wrong with borrowing from other movies. Except that the new piece needs some fresh energy to retool the old ideas and bring them back to life. And that is exactly what Battlefield Earth lacks.
"The glossy Manhattan footage, as hermetic as Woody Allen's rendition of New York, is engagingly expensive-looking at least, but the cast is barely given anything to work with."
"The polite word for his kind of filmmaking is ""classical.'' Another word is ""trite."""
"There is no spark, identity or glimmer of freshness in this film. Let's put it this way, it has no sense of ""self."""
"If you've never heard of a ""living funeral,"" this film is an icy introduction."
"One of the most unwatchable films in recent memory, a dishonest bit of corporate-suite sanitizing that's no good even for laughs."
"It's like he wants to make his own ""2001,"" but can't resist putting in a climactic gunfight between HAL and Dave."
[Kevin's] battle with the burglars -- surely the point of these flicks -- mistakes the pain threshold for hilarity.
Soulless excuse for an entertainment.
"Majors is certainly chilling and captivating, but Kang seems like a mismatched foe for a standalone Ant-Man film and the result is a Quantumania that is trying to be too many things. "
"It's all rather clinical, but in the maudlin way that only show business can muster up when it's in one of its teary, pretentious moods."
"The tale is there for the taking, but miscasting, violent repetition, and a lack of character depth make the picture feel forgettable, even during its most evocative and emotional moments."
The lingering deaths of soldiers and the lost causes they embody serve as tragic backdrops to the less compelling plot points embodied by Briony and her characters.
"The 14-year-behind-the-scenes story of making this sequel is far more interesting than anything that's onscreen, including Sharon Stone's nudity and sex in a rooftop jacuzzi."
Wearying rehash
"A series of small bad decisions hampers this handsome adaptation of Markus Zusak's World War II-set novel, starting with the subtitles."
More with these sequels is always less. The proportions haven't been right since 2002.
One can't shake the impression that Spade has been handed his unwanted leftovers.
"The movie blows all over the place, too, as its meandering plotlines do flesh out this portrait of a success who believes himself a failure, but never expands any further."
"Eternals offers too much interesting stuff to be dismissed as ""bad"" outright, but it's frustratingly uneven."
Nothing in this well-intentioned but lifeless indie draws the hard laughter that comes from creating characters that somehow get to you.
Deadly dull.
An Undercooked Concoction.
"Ultimately this is stuffy, old man's cinema, narrow in scope and ambition and of little interest to anyone except golf movie completists."
"While not one single performance...can be faulted, the movie seems disconnected from a story that has clearly unified and inspired its actors."
"Flat visuals, flat script, flat performances: Ghosted is only mildly redeemed by the on-the-ground travelogue footage of Taipei and Hamburg, and I'm being generous."
"A knockoff might be perfectly entertaining, but you still got a knockoff."
It's the kind of picture that results when a film maker loses sight of the fact that a portion of his audience might actually think while watching a movie.
The gutsy [Jennifer] Lawrence [is] badly miscast as a shrinking violet.
"The copious footage devoted to Billy and Jane's encounters might have been easier to sit through is there was any magic between Costner and Preston, but they're acting in two different films."
"Two hours of . . . lazy filmmaking and tired, harmful stereotypes against women and the mentally ill, all wearing a thin sheen of imposter silk to pass itself off as a cautionary tale."
There might be three or four laugh lines in the whole 117 minutes.
[I]t comes across more like an exercise in superficial style and attitude than anything else.
"Too busy slotting [Crosby's] life into a tediously archetypal baby boomer narrative to make space for the elephant in the room: Crosby's talent, rampaging away just offscreen."
"Campbell's film has style for days, if not terribly much behind it: It's an antique book with mostly blank pages."
"Although the film is entirely watchable, the director carelessly exploits the potential for race drama."
Zeffirelli hides behind the closet door of the film's gaudy Carmen scenes.
"Nobody goes to a movie like Rampage for the poetry, but truly this is a terrible screenplay, credited to four writers and tonally all over the place."
This climax is so stupid and the rest of the film so incapable of generating any interest that the only thing left to focus on is the amount time remaining until the end credits.
Tuneless ABBA tunes sung in a combination prequel & sequel by ever smiling stars in predictable movie musical fashion. A better title: Mamma Mia: Why'd We Go Again?
Not Okay is appropriately an anti-redemption movie&#44; but it struggles to find the humor or the compelling drama in a touchy subject&#46;
No one's taking any real risks with Kong: Skull Island except to promise the return of more monster mash-ups.
"The intention, I take it, is to steer us into seeing the drama as something universal, to draw what modern parallels we choose. And if this is so, it seems to me misguided."
"I will always appreciate storytellers who take big, wide swings in an effort to deliver an audacious vision, but those swings need to make sense, too. And the story in Antebellum just doesn't gel at all."
Sporadically intriguing yet ultimately unsatisfying...
"...plays like a construct imposed upon inauthentic characters, rather than an organic, attuned narrative"
"If you've ever wondered why studios treat this month like a celluloid landfill, The Abandoned presents a compelling case study on its own lack of merit."
"There are some genuine laughs in the first ten minutes. Then they stop almost altogether, and the realization sets in that this movie is a one-trick pony."
The gory decapitations and gushing blood - imagine filling a million balloons with cherry Kool-Aid and using them in a water-balloon fight - turn the action scenes into an indistinguishable sea of red.
This thriller almost works as a fun puzzle-box popcorn-muncher&#44; but it borrows too many familiar elements from other movies and can&apos;t overcome its mechanical&#44; artificial feel -- or its logic holes&#46; 
"With so much going for it, why does The Tempest become a mere storm in a teacup? The reasons are many."
"Isn't a noticeable regression from its predecessor. But it's no advancement either, suggesting the risks inherent in franchise filmmaking."
There is a great movie buried in this cacophonous mess
"Breezy, harmless and mildly engaging, but ultimately insipid and forgettable."
"It's a serviceable animated take on a well known tale that also happens to be a sequel. One could call it a movie solely for kids, but you can't even trust them being happy with the product."
"Without more consistent laughs, the satire curdles on contact, removing the whole point of the character's bad behavior in the first place."
"[Death on the Nile] has pizazz and period style in the same way today’s big-brand toothpastes have flavor -- artificial ingredients give them a taste that’s discernible, but too generic to name."
Trashy remake of John M. Stahl's 1934 classic
"Fine cast delivers the goods, but the murkiness is thick and finally overpowering."
Sofia Coppola's On the Rocks is yet another meandering depiction of life as a bored and alienated celebrity.
"There's no reason or logic in this found-footage yawner, and nothing rises to the level of even adolescent notions of sexy-scary."
Williams appears to be riffing for another 'Comic Relief' benefit.
The characters remain faces on a brochure.
"Point Break aspires to be a decent remake, but winds up being one of the most boring action films ever made."
Director Joachim Rønning gets some parts right and some parts wonderfully wrong. Maybe what he needed was another fairy tale instead of stretching this one to its limits and making it sag in the process...
"Unremarkable in scope and VFX by today's standards, even this movie barely seems to care about that brand of spectacle as it wipes cities off the map."
"It feels like each and every moment bursts forth with urgent dialogue, and yet what does anyone actually say?"
Laughably predictable and lamentably unfunny.
"Hilary Swank may have two Oscars, but P.S. I Love You proves she has plenty to learn about romantic comedies."
"Rather more plodding than a story involving an invisible fire-breathing wyvern really should be, all things considered."
"Constants emerge: threadbare production values, underqualified performers and a failure to filter the amusingly crass from the merely offensive."
Warm gloss of nostalgia over the rise of the punk music scene in gritty 1970's downtown New York. The spirit of musical and visual energy outweighs fanciful superficiality.
My biggest problem with Venus Beauty Institute is the mixed messages that it sends.
"Ham-handed, obvious, overblown and pretentious, For Colored Girls is a plain disaster."
"The problem is that the movie, which hampers its value with a bloated running time of 176-minutes, never feels fresh, original, or essential. "
"There is no momentum in Mockingjay Part 2, as the pacing is terrible."
The lack of dramatic tension means it's difficult to emotionally connect with the central characters and their dilemma.
"Given the tinsel-thin storyline, the typical seasonal gags only elicit perfunctory laughter."
"While the film looks authentic in every insignificant detail, it never seems remotely real from an emotional standpoint."
"A poor effort, packed with sub-par Tarantino-esque anecdotes."
"I swear to you that I have never had a film experience that felt longer than the whopping 149 minutes of Revenge of the Fallen, every single one of which I wish I had spent doing something else."
"Despite a commanding, Oscar-nominated performance by the always-interesting Javier Bardem, there's a quality of manufactured misery to ""Biutiful""..."
Ode to Joy is one strange little motion picture.
"Emmerich, Bay and their brethren need to learn how boring these CGI onslaughts have become. When we see 18 skyscrapers collapse and several dozen vehicles wreck at the same moment, what do we focus on?"
"When the director of a twisted, turgid murder mystery admits something went wrong, it's worth noting..."
"""Gringo"" has no spark, no fizz. Its scenes sag like overstretched taffy. Flavorless taffy."
Character development and narrative substance are absent in this wispy movie about beefcake and getting a knack for teamwork in an oppressive atmosphere.
The movie's reach extends beyond it's grasp.
Embarrassingly clumsy.
"John Cassavetes' Husbands is disappointing in the way Antonioni's Zabriskie Point was. It shows an important director not merely failing, but not even understanding why."
The long march across the Antarctic wasteland ... sometimes feels just as arduous as the real thing.
"If it wasn't for the light tone and good time the actors have playing these characters, Zoolander no.2 wouldn't be more than a bunch of cameos in designer clothes cashing a big check. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Although it's as funny as any movie this summer, Clerks II has to struggle to achieve the level of universality that the original ""Clerks"" seemed to hit effortlessly."
"So generic, so lazy, and so forgettable they may as well have ""we're not even trying"" plastered across the bottom of the screen."
It's very uneven.
Nothing more than a cheap horror film that uncomfortably flirts with blasphemy.  [Full review in Spanish] 
Hart nothing but a lightweight.
The vagueness feels like a term paper you have to grade.
This movie rekindling of Bill Cosby's long-running Saturday morning cartoon rings of squandered potential.
fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense.
"I'd pay to watch Terry Gilliam take out his trash, but there's nothing in Lost in La Mancha much more exciting than that."
It's an echo of Park's film and will be quickly dismissed in the legacy of its director.
"The acting is perfectly fine, and everyone, especially the two kids, manages to rise above the sub-par script, but unfortunately, not that much."
There's a good reason this story was once told as a miniseries: that's a lot of plot for a movie that clocks in at just under two hours.
"Dreary, leaden lesbian film-noir."
"For a film about one of the fastest guns in the West, the dramatically lightweight ""Hickok"" is mighty slow on the draw."
"Stagnant, contrived, and oh so boring, The Promise is nothing but a perfectly good waste of Christian Bale and Oscar Isaac's towering abilities."
It is a sad state when all the best aspects of a Mel Brooks comedy have little to do with the humor.
Run a mile in any direction from Fast and Furious.
Amateurish&#46;&#46;&#46;I did not care for &#8220;The Mean One&#8221; mess&#46; I do not like bastardized Seuss&#44; I confess&#46;
"Horton may hear a Who, but the rest of us may hear a lot of hoopla, and it's not all the charming sort you expect from a benign Seussian world."
Belly flops the moment the movie morphs in to a stalk and slash torture film.
"At best a bit of indie-film eye candy, at worst an art-house minstrel show..."
"One of the ugliest films of the year, Maps to the Stars finds no visual storytelling methods at all, which is especially disappointing given the director's trademark audaciously sexualised grotesquery would have been a perfect fit..."
"Effectively gritty when need be, but for most of its running time meanders as it tries to find its central story arc."
"Overstays its welcome at 133 minutes. All four lead actors play their parts admirably, but the story lacks the zing of the original."
"The predictable plot lurches forward elliptically, and it's difficult to sustain interest in it."
"They end up drawing a lot of attention to the questionable design of the creatures, to the point that I was almost waiting for the actors to laugh. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"The Alamo is handsomely shot and written with plain-spoken eloquence. But the characters are indistinct, and there's no compelling reason for this movie."
&apos;Cocaine Bear&apos; is like if you bought a funny t-shirt and then found out you had to wear it every day for an entire year&#46; Or like the meme equivalent of your dad catching you smoking and making you finish the pack&#46; 
It's too long and simplistic for the slight story it tells.
It&#8217;s not clear to me why Schrader&#44; who is plausibly the finest screenwriter in the history of cinema&#44; continues to make visually bland&#44; morally dull stories that would be more appropriately told by someone else&#46;
"When the lasting image of Mr. Nanny is Hulk Hogan in a tutu, it's not a pleasant thought."
"World Trade Center is the second major studio picture to weigh in on the events of Sept. 11, 2001. It is a more limited achievement: a comfortably unsettling drama."
Too Late the Hero is updated to the extent that it tosses in some war-is-hell comments as well a few thoughts about the demoralizing effect it has on men. It's still old fashioned stuff none the less.
"Might work in the first half, but it turns into a mess full of destruction. [Full review in Spanish]"
The movie asks good questions but fails to answer them in an interesting way. What makes an ordinary person seek out superstardom and why is the public so obsessed with taking it away from them?
"I was really hoping that despite all the bad buzz on this thing I might buck the trend and actually like it, but, as Alex Trebek might say: ""Sorry..... no""."
"Jimenez adopts a vintage-kitsch sensibility, taking a disappointingly generic approach to his hard-to-follow narrative."
The results are quite dismal; a frontloaded plot introducing characters for roughly 30 minutes and an emotionally lifeless 40-minute aftermath of the catastrophic tornado
"Unholy Rollers is heavy on violence and four-letter words and short on character, but that seems to make the picture true to its source."
You can fake almost everything on camera except palpable chemistry. 
"Even if you're just looking for a Tyler Perry night out, be very afraid."
This is a substandard Plane movie that never takes off&#46; 
"The question that suggests itself in response to all this is a spectral ""Why ... ?"""
Talented collaborators on both sides of the camera are stranded by this formulaic thriller that manages a handful of stylish action sequences but little intrigue to tie them together.
Zack Snyder can work wonders with visuals. It's the scripts that can let him down.
"Steinfeld herself is charismatic and brimming with energy, and delivers a performance that's much richer than the movie is or deserves."
"Jason Bourne is a serviceable Bourne franchise installment, but an uninventive and unnecessary epilogue to the original Bourne movie trilogy."
"The latest and least of the Saw films is just plain boring and even a little tame -- albeit by the standards of a genre that helped bring the phrase ""torture porn"" into the lexicon."
"It is all crash, bang, wallop action movie business as usual, far too long and horribly repetitive in parts."
"The twist in Pascal Laugier's narrative is undermined by plot holes so large you could drive an ice cream truck through them, and the frankly silly ending only makes things worse."
"The scenes, characters and songs attempt to duplicate the success of Mermaid all too obviously."
"It's not totally without merit (Kurt, mostly) but there's little nuance or replay-ability here."
"A sincere but repetitive drone of a picture... ""Love"" feels deeply, but not complexly."
"Instead of making the young woman's search feel immediate and universal, such an ascetic treatment locks it away in the past."
"Unfortunately, the A plot keeps dragging the movie down"
It's a brightly colored headache of a movie with lowbrow humor and obnoxious characters that will be just as much of an irritant to children as it is to their parents.
Jobs blows.
Plays like a fly-on-the-wall documentary that wrapped production before anything interesting happened...
"Ultimately, Night School's biggest crime is how bland it is. It's difficult to care about anything that happens, because the jokes are so flat, the characters so dull."
"Though the cast partially eschews the family-friendly timidity that the film defers to in the end, this would-be wild thing remains little more than a rowdy endorsement of the status quo."
The execution isn't quite up to the movie's ambition.
"Larraín turns this Diana into exactly the thing the royal family accused the real-life Diana of being, a willful and pouty constant complainer."
This movie unfortunately comes off as mostly something old and something borrowed -- from Terry McMillian novels and from better movies.
"The schmaltzy resolution may work for the undemanding, but given how much fabulous work has gone into the film, it's a shame the result isn't a more complete success"
The Reflektor Tapes is less a documentary about the making of Arcade Fire's 2013 album than a feature-length collage that does neither the band nor its fans any service.
Perhaps it worked better as a theatrical endeavor&#44; but the result is a film that feels like a collection of familiar hospital set storylines thrown together without a true compelling throughline&#46;
This story about untapped human potential rarely taps into its own.
Bringing Out the Dead fails on almost every level at which Taxi Driver succeeded.
"Actress turned writer-director Romola Garai has visual flair and an impeccable taste in European actors, but the screenplay of her feature debut, Amulet, leaves much to be desired."
"If Alice Through the Looking-Glass has a saving grace, it's the message that women are as capable as men. But the original novels and the lovely star deserve a much better movie."
Flat teenage melodrama meets off the mark assassination thriller in the woefully made Abduction.
This comically tasteless and flavorless adaptation of Ayn Rand's bombastic magnum opus delivers her simplistic nostrums with smug self-satisfaction.
My cat has coughed up hairballs that make more sense than MIAMI VICE
&apos;Tammy&#44;&apos; tell me true&#44; why couldn&apos;t you have been funnier&#63;
"The third installment in the series has the stale, slightly sour ambiance you'd expect when walking into a summer house that's been shut up for the winter."
"The confused, heel-dragging mystery drama Exposed suggests an especially dour, arty episode of Law & Order: SVU, minus any reasons to keep watching."
"Alas, when you're handed crap to start with, there's really no way to dress it up as anything but."
"""Jungeland"" is serviceable entertainment, but can't understand the tone it's going for."
"""The A-Team"" combines over-the-top action scenes with lifeless jokes and the disappointing result is an uninspired action comedy."""
A fully animated and partially boring film. [Full review in Spanish]
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is a profoundly dissatisfying film.
"Petrie deadens any possible momentum or energy; he can't even make one of our greatest actors, Gene Hackman, appear presidential."
Firestarter barely manages a spark when it should be an inferno&#46;
Better than the overly political first sequel but more labored than the carefree original&#44; the third Harold &amp; Kumar film won&#8217;t go down as a Christmas classic or the entry needed to revitalize this series anew&#46;
"The film's worst sin is that I never bought into the notion that Ben Kingsley was inside Ryan Reynolds (and that's something I never imagined I'd put in writing). (Full Content Review - Sex, Nudity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)"
"The Italian Job has a decent enough heart, and, thanks to Seth Green and Mos Def, some funny moments. It's just not racing with enough adrenaline."
"Si, Antonio is a charming man, but by the final bows the movie around him is all left feet and bruised angles, and much more of a farrago than a fandango."
Hugely ambitious but often failing to live up to those ambitions.
'Deliverance' us! In this case the wrong turn is into the theater parking lot.
"The filmmaker isn’t so much interested in telling us about the Kraffts or even about the little-understood science of volcanology, but in creating a low-key twee mood that edges past cute straight into grating."
"Though Turistas eventually bogs down in an underlit mess, it more or less scratches the neo-exploitation itch."
"It is as though filmmaker Ira Sachs fears that just making a film about infidelity is too straight, too pedestrian, so, he's got to introduce the possibility that murder is on the horizon."
"If Breaking and Entering were a piece of music, it would be the kind to which you'd have to either listen closely the first time around or listen again to make sure you didn't miss anything."
"Would have been fine as a simple, slickly-produced TV movie, but with Ford and Oldman in the cast it can't be considered anything but a big-screen letdown."
"It doesn't feel like a cohesive piece, so while it's at times charming, and does get off the ground in the last act, the getting there is extremely bumpy."
"Chandor makes good use of his acting assets and there's no doubt that he knows how to direct, but ultimately, the dullness of the script is just a little too toxic."
"If, as is believed in certain fringe circles, the world will come to an end in 2012, at least there will be no more movies like this one made."
"Thank God those penguins can dance just like humans, eh? It means they deserve to live!"
The pointless kind of weird.
A lot of yelling and some pretty annoying kids&#44; which makes it hard to really enjoy what the filmmaker may have been trying to achieve&#46;
"Rodriguez inserts loud, frenetic and oddly bloodless gun battles wherever possible and to constantly diminishing effect."
An ostensible action film that is so light on well-crafted fights one hesitates to even classify it as such&#44; Bullet Train can best be described as a low-rent Quentin Tarantino imitation though without anything of its own to stand on&#46;
"[Nine Lives] is a children's movie made by people who not only don't understand children, but may actively hate children. It is unfunny and condescending, a collective collection of paychecks."
Starts well but rather quickly begins to peter out under the strain of a messy narrative and uneven tones
"The melodramatic flourish that ends The Ledge feels unearned and unclean: It's the sort of ending that ought to hit hard, and yet it comes off as perversely inconsequential."
Swank takes some time off to vacation in a silly paranormal thriller.
"It relies on cheap thrills and fails to generate consistent suspense, while lacking the sharp sense of humor that kept the first film from bogging down."
Witch Mountain isn't escapism but a feature-length reminder that things are bad all over.
"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle is merely a preposterous, maximized manipulation of the original film's winning formula."
"Dumb, direct and derivative."
"Black man dies first and everyone else lines up to be slaughtered one by one through actions that scream, 'DO NOT go in there, you ignorant moron!'"
Rob the Mob is the story of two lovers who are clearly a few eggs short of a baker's dozen.
Given the sorry history of movies based on video games -- there&apos;s last year&apos;s rollicking Werewolves Within and then there&apos;s everything else -- Uncharted is probably better than it had any right to be&#46;
Bernie lacks the edge of malice one might reasonably expect from so nasty a tale.
"Schreiber seems to wander through the film like Hamlet's ghost, waiting for his soliloquy to come, and it never does. He's kind of a cold fish, and Stiles isn't much better."
"Every syllable of action, as we grind towards the broadly guessable finish, is jeopardy-free and interest-free."
"Occasionally striking, often embarrassing."
"The picture is still a Russian-centric blob of overcooked genre pie filling, aiming high but barely able to keep up with itself; yet, Day Watch is a step in the right direction"
"[The sex scenes] are hot and all, but Below Her Mouth makes the mistake of not having an interesting story to tie those scenes into."
Henry Poole Is Here is so stupid it makes you itch. I half expected to exit the theater with gushing stigmata.
"If it weren't for Mo'Nique's fresh, appealing screen presence, Phat Girlz would fall flat."
"Preachy, overly symbolic and worst of all, dull."
Dumb and irritating.
So much idle chatter that it's practically radio--Morning Zoo Crew: The Movie.
"[Director Michael] Grecco comes across as a naive, wide-eyed kid in Wonderland, which might be sweet if it wasn't so obvious his real motivation is to make the audience feel good about buying his book."
"Who was Piero, and more to the point, why should we care? Bratt brings him to life, but we come away appreciating his genius no more than we did before."
"Larger, louder, more laborious."
"For every chuckle-worthy gag, there's another that never gets off the ground."
Stay home. Because I said so.
"Sitting through ""Waking Life"" is like being trapped in a painting filled with philosophy students"
The bad pacing and strange infatuation with Moore smoking and wearing high heels results in a picture that lacks snap and labours slowly through the plot twists.
"The whole is a bit on the wan side, not a lot of entertainment value, a nice moment here and there, but nothing big or unexpected or even fun."
I truly loathed just about every second of Life as We Know It.
"Cynically conceived, unfunny, non-romantic sludge."
"The special effects are incredibly poor, even by 1995's standards."
Monster Hunter relies to heavily on Jovovich's screen charm but fails to develop a cohesive universe in which to build an engaging story. It takes itself too seriously to even enjoy it campiness and it is too campy to be considered a serious film.
"The Beach, designed to provoke audiences, stops for too many Hollywood moments to get the job done."
Smacks of a movie made by people who've spent a lot more time watching movies than absorbing them.
"Perfect Holiday is far from an offensive effort. It's just pathetic and forgettable, and when it comes to Christmas cheer, mediocrity should never be left under the tree."
"Isn't really as good as the underrated 1980s diptych, Breakin' and the superb Breakin' 2: Electric Boogalo..."
Worth a bargain matinee or a future rental.
"Tedious. But it's enough to sustain a universe until next time, which is all that's required."
"Not exactly the IMF turning up in countries with dubious offers that fuck and enrage economically enslaved unsuspecting countries, but these jungle sex tourists bear some negative similarities. In you might say, an accidentally important film."
"Highlighting the pitfalls of family-run businesses, the problem with House of Gucci is its focus on the wrong people."
The falsetto-powered crooner's life is more fascinating than this cursory glance.
It's difficult to determine just how much of the film is specifically gratuitous partial nudity and how much is a purposeful lampoon.
"Like the recently opened Amelia, the story could well be an accurate depiction of Chanel's life but it, too, is not all that engaging."
"Strangerland amounts to little more than a turgid 2 hours with a pair of bland, lifeless characters."
"There's a difference between connecting to a writer's work and reading too much of yourself in it, and the banal film version of Fowler's book crosses the line six too many times."
"It's an alternately hilarious and lame movie, but fairly inoffensive if one overlooks some breaches of political correctness and heavy reliance on shots to the groin."
I found myself both enjoying the character and certain gags while wishing I could skip ahead 2-3 years to see the presumably superior sequel.
An easily avoided waste of time.
"Cedric the Entertainer stars in a long drive in search of a family comedy, which is found too late and amounts to too little."
"Has some good central performances, visuals and ideas but still ends up being standard series fare."
"Although shot with grace by Coco before Chanel's Christophe Beaucarne, it's a film that never sweeps you up in the story."
"The great irony of the film is that while its plot is all about the search for soul, Ghost In The Shell is all style, no soul - or, rather, all shell, no ghost."
"It only rarely becomes less than apparent that lurking behind these clever characters there's a cleverer screenwriter, delighting himself as he takes turns setting each of them up for a verbal fall."
"Unfortunately, Committed turns into something far more nasty, stale, and unfunny from there."
The way the movie repeatedly drives home the motivations for Phoenix's paternally scorned neurosis and Crowe's proud victim becomes repetitious; you think they could have brought some more shading to the characters in 160 minutes. 
...Russo-Young can't set her hooks into much beyond the postcard images of the Big Apple.
"No one should be offended except, of course, those who like movies that excite the mind as well as the pulse."
Dilbert without the right-on satiric humor.
"Though its heart is certainly in the right place, Storks doesn't hold much for anybody - and even its intended audience of youngish children might find it a bore."
"Built around a fearless performance by the protean Robert Downey Jr., this deliberately provocative story of deception and sexuality packs a punch that's undermined by the director's indulgence."
The franchise switches to 3D animation for this take on one of the original books. The characters thus look more like they do on the page -- and less like a bunch of actors in It's a Knockout costumes -- yet they still aren't quite right.
"Either this is a tragic family or a satirical one, and the film seems uncertain which way to jump."
"Neil Jordan makes a cheesy stalker movie that takes its cue from much better this-person's-crazy predecessors like Single White Female, The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, and of course, Fatal Attraction."
"If only How to Be Single had the smarts to not just deliver twists on clichs, but avoid them altogether."
Only rarely does Karim Aïnouz allow for loopholes to refreshingly emerge from the film's stylistic deadlock.
"There's a reason The Monuments Men was taken from its holiday slot and moved to February. Somebody - Clooney perhaps - knew the picture just didn't have the goods. That it's dull and preachy, despite its fine cast."
"A provocative and ultimately frustrating odyssey...Cosmopolis never pulls itself together, sputtering out in a final conversation between Pattinson and Giamatti."
"Far from advertised 'lush, poetic language,' the film's dialogue is pancake flat, including verbal sparring."
The worst thing is you can almost bet that an executive at Touchstone has already put the wheels in motion for a sequel to bloat an industry that is already chock-full of uninspiring films such as this one.
"A paean film to lonely misfits that follows along the same tracks as ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" and relies entirely on being a charmer."
"Von Trotta, who's obviously less personally invested in her story, seems more than a little calculating in her efforts to wring tears."
"PVT Chat has interesting moments and eye-catching characters (Jacks shady friends who call him Blackjack Jack make his gloomy world a little larger). However, none of this arthouse fodder seems to gel in the way you hope it will. "
"[F]or all of its winking and joking, Thor: Ragnarok ultimately cannot escape the trap of established formula."
"Even Al Pacino can't bellow loud enough to drown out the raging stupidity that courses through Two for the Money, the latest in a lamentable line of movies in which Screaming Al mentors a protege with predictable results."
"If Sidewalks is still a pretty hard film to laugh at, that's not because it stirs horrific memories. The laughs don't come easily because the humor often feels forced."
Unpleasant post-apocalyptic drama.
"Fairly fun, and occasionally exciting, but so bombastic that you'll feel more like you're being bombarded, than actually watching a film."
"This tepid summer animated offering limps along like an aged, mangy lion with bunions."
"Copacabana proves that Isabelle Huppert can do anything, including starring in a trivial mother-daughter dramedy that's beneath her considerable talents."
"the reason for the remake is nowhere apparent. It is not suspenseful. It is not high-action. The dialogue is as flat as the delta mud, and the direction by Kormakur is a study in understanding style, but not storytelling"
It would be as funny as a Christopher Guest mockumentary if it weren't also so sad.
"It's surprisingly conventional, but not in a reassuring or back-to-basics way; its set ups and jokes are creaky and labored, its characters stock and strait-jacketed."
A film that only seeks to exploit nostalgia and tries to do (without success) what 21 Jump Street managed to revive a tv show and bring it to the big screen. [Full review in Spanish]
It proves that even legends have bills that have to be paid...what else explains Morgan Freeman's participation?
Brings a novel twist to the romantic comedy but spoils the fun by miscasting Oscar-winner Jean Dujardin.
"The film feels bland and unadventurous, quite the opposite of what you need for a cross-country trail that can throw up so many possibilities. From top to bottom, it feels thoroughly mediocre."
...again stale sitcom stuff with lame pop culture references...
Stephen Frears seems to feel more attracted by the nostalgic imprint of the situation than by a deeper approach to the context of this rare link. [Full Review in Spanish]
"James is an engaging presence, but as this season with the Lakers proved, he alone just isn't enough."
"a horrific failure for Niels Arden Oplev, whose THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, DEAD MAN DOWN, and the pilot for ""Mr. Robot"", suggested a certain boldness that's utterly absent here."
"There's a limit to how long a movie can mess with viewers' minds, and ""Ultrasound"" eventually crosses that threshold."
"The sincere message -- perseverance is essential when faced with life's setbacks -- is a good one, but the movie is a bit of a chore to watch."
"By taking a safe, piecemeal approach -- and treating the original a sacred text rather than completely reinventing it -- the result at times seems weirdly anachronistic."
"Watkins knows how to make a body jump out of its skin, even if he does use the face-reflected-in-the-mirror/window trick once too often. At the same time, the film is kind of, well, silly."
A realist melodrama that offers little to no nuance.
An incomprehensible mess.
"It's a high-concept gimmick that could go either way, and this one ends up parting straight down the middle."
Right at Your Door finds itself somewhat adrift.
"If anything in Meet Dave surprises you, you've never seen a family movie before. Instead, go to the movie only for Murphy, whose talents really shine in this role."
"There isn't nearly as much comedy as you would expect based on the previews. There's nothing wrong with that, except the created void isn't really filled with anything, and that ending is just bad."
"Regardless of how silly the storyline becomes, Perry's admiration for single dads who take care of their kids and people who take their faith and their families seriously comes through..."
Hopefully Hollywood will learn a lesson from the movie that the American government still hasn't: stay out of South American politics.
There is a great deal wrong with a movie that adds insult to injury by unconsciously holding back the revelation of make-up. 
"This unintentionally hilarious take, on territory covered much more soberly and with far less reliance on prosthetic bellies in current Netflix hit ""Narcos,"" is so trashy it may even make you forget a few things you knew before."
An on-the-nose approach smothers all subtext into submission and leaves nothing of interest alive.
Lovers of period crime capers and fans of the original Friedkin film should definitely take note. But those new to the considerable history behind the making of the film may feel a bit distanced by Jimenez's approach.
The film equivalent of a deep-fried Mars bar: an interesting combination that results in a gloppy mess.
"Amidst the lukewarm broth of deepfakes and green screen that make for the main entertainment of this film, there are very few fun, memorable moments except for the most stupid ones, and we'd rather forget about those. [Full review in Spanish]"
Here's a by-the-playbook movie if ever there was one. The machinations leading up to the big night are hardly worth the fuss: Prom's entertainment quotient comes up deficient.
This self-conscious film feels convincingly told only part of the time.
He Named Me Malala repeats the well-known facts of Yousafzai's history and offers little insight into the now 18-year-old teenager that exists behind the icon. Uplift is the film's only goal.
there's more to Clouseau than just making a mess of things
Wait till it's out on video. Then borrow it.
It's mostly entertaining ... but it's a little long... and is far from Hanson's best film.
"I don't hate Stillwater and indeed, there are stretches where it is reasonably compelling, but considering the pedigree of those involved and the generally meh results, I cannot regard it as anything other than a bit of a disappointment."
Stock characters played broadly in a script rife with clich plot devices and a bad case of the blands
"The sfx in the climactic duel with the Devil is cheesy to say the least and the Devil's makeup render him more laughable than scary. On the face of it, the dice is loaded heavily against the movie."
Astonishing! Enthralling! Exciting! Immersive! None of these words could sensibly be applied to the three-and-a-quarter-hour Wet Smurfahontas stodgeathon that is Avatar: The Way of Water.
"The chief frustration of ""That Awkward Moment"" is that everyone in it is so much better than the material ..."
"The effort to make thinking man's sci-fi is admirable, but it requires a steadier, surer hand."
"It just wouldn't be Christmas if there wasn't a group of actors pushed into a room together with thin characterization, forced to fight for limited screentime."
"Lay(s) on the saccharine schmaltz in broad, simplistic layers."
The ill fit between Mirror Mirror's screenplay and its director's sensibilities dooms the comedic fairy tale from the outset.
"The bloody, carnage-laden finale is well-constructed -- one of the only segments of the film deserving of that accolade -- but the climax alone doesn't offset two hours of stilted dialogue, grim subject matter and unpleasant personalities."
"Despite a formidable lead performance from Keke Palmer, this tonally awkward endeavor stumbles on earnest sentiments rather than mining the delirious brutality of its reality."
I don't understand this movie.
"Throughout Star Wars:The Rise of Skywalker, you'll keep waiting for that moment. But that lump in your throat, that ache in your heart that could only result from such beloved fictions becoming something more real, it never comes."
"Almost all questions remain unanswered, and the open-endedness spoke more to the director not being bothered rather than wanting to suggest ambiguity."
[An] agonisingly self-conscious and meagre piece of work.
"James Bond is old. Wrinkled-forehead old. Lecherous-coot old. Strategic-hairstyle old. Senior meal-discount old. Simply ... old. That's the biggest takeaway from Roger Moore's second-worst outing as 007, hot on the heels of his second-best."
Parental Content Review
"As bombastic, shoot-'em-up spectacle, ""13 Hours"" is a visceral, well-paced and often beautiful action-thriller."
"It's a mess - a slasher movie that's almost never scary, slathered with ""topical"" pablum and with too many parallel plot strands that don't go anywhere."
"It's as if the film is a no-humour zone, and any attempt at a laugh gets sucked into a cinematic vacuum of mirthlessness."
"I understand (director Jim) Carroll's desire to attract a wider audience. But in doing so, he has diluted his far-out concept in an attempt to make his movie mainstream."
The downside is that for the final half-hour the camera shakes so badly I started suffering from motion sickness.
"Oculus isn't scary. It's an idea of what might be frightening, but it never delivers on its solid potential"
"As for this 'performance capture,' rife with characters sporting the annoying wandering eye, it might be time for an intervention, ghostly or not. You're a filmmaker, Mr. Z, not a puppeteer. Enough is enough."
"It never feels like we're watching people pressed on by the burdens of society and history, just extravagantly costumed puppets navigating Wright's colorfully shallow bag of tricks."
"In concept, Brightburn sounds like a DC variation of Marvel's popular What If? line. In execution, it plays like yet another underwhelming adaptation of The Omen."
"English spent 12 years slaving to get her remake green-lighted, an astounding output of time and energy for a person to spend on a movie they don't understand."
An inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength.
"Unfortunately, in General Education, even tried-and-true formulas fall flat thanks to the lack of several key elements-good dialogue, fully developed characters and a satisfying story."
"If David Lynch's Eraserhead were transported to bleakest Norfolk, you might end up with something as uncomfortable to watch as Possum."
"[An] illogical, repulsive nightmare..."
"A few gags are too inspired for Rat Race to be lumped in with the recent spate of wretched comedies. But it also includes too many broad, shrill and gratuitously vulgar moments to be defended without apologies."
The story of Darren Aronofsky's ambitious sci-fi epic The Fountain spans a thousand years. The movie itself only seems that long.
"Yes, it's different. Yes, it's odd. Yes, it's got some laughs. For all those ""yeses,"" though, it eventually adds up to an overly busy ""no."""
"If patience isn't a virtue you possess, pass on The Pursuit of Happyness."
The characters are as dull as their city is dismal.
[A] Twinkie of a comedy...
Contemplative cinema with nothing to contemplate.
Bombshell settles for being voyeuristic when it could have been smart and powerful. It is a missed opportunity.
It's not objectionable (which is saying something these days) but neither does it have any compelling reason to be seen.
"Jim Jarmusch's latest film doesn't end well at all. In fact, the white-haired hipster has created something close to a painfully self-aware groaner that stumbles in a semi-conscious daze from start to finish."
"The Fall is an encounter with the mythic in human history and you want to give Singh a pat on the back for his chutzpah, even if the film itself registers as terrifyingly self-indulgent and often incoherent."
Um festival embaraoso de caretas e gritaria.
At least Hoodwinked is fun to look at when nondescript musical numbers or uninspiring characters fail to please.
"Poppe's closeness to the material ensures a level of passion, but he still fails to create a truly specific dynamic for Rebecca and Marcus's family ..."
The Son is a complete misfire -- a film that desperately wants to explore the trauma of mental illness but does it in such a heavy-handed manner that not one thing in the film feels authentic.
An import non-thriller so enigmatic and subtle that it's inert.
"With all the good will in the world, I couldn't warm up to Kit Kittredge. The movie is like a 1930s or 1940s short about Americans pulling together, stretched out to feature length."
"The fight sequences are limp, the pace often drags, and the dramatic moments elicit more laughter than the comic ones."
"sort of like a wild combination of 'The English Patient' and '2001: A Space Odyssey.' ...Although it's brave and beautiful, 'The Fountain' is always more impressive than it is truly touching."
The film has a message at its core but the execution is way too simplistic with the actors acting as if they weren't paid.
"If the pic went on any further, I think you might have seen the invincible Denzel taking on Putin's Russian army by himself and winning."
Does every semi-famous person deserve a full-length documentary about them?
"Kristen Bell, in the silly romantic comedy When in Rome, has the wry perkiness of a 20-something Sarah Jessica Parker, and you sit through the movie wondering what she might do with better material than this."
"As an architect of modern feminism, Ruth Bader Ginsburg deserves accolades, but that's all this glossy and thin lionization has to offer."

JURASSIC WORLD DOMINION tries too hard&#44; and yet is both lazy and uninspired&#46; Even the legacy characters can&apos;t hide its lack of heart and soul&#46;
"The narrative has the choppy quality of a badly bowdlerised book, and the result is not bad so much as boring - and best thought of as a tree, fallen in the forest, that nobody heard."
"The architecture of ""The Debt"" has an unfortunate flaw. The younger versions of the characters have scenes that are intrinsically more exciting, but the actors playing the older versions are more interesting."
There is no room for reason or compelling data in this grossly manipulative and sloppy propaganda flick. The filmmakers are simply out to break you.
"""Eternals"" makes history as the most diverse superhero movie in terms of race, gender, orientation, age and abilities...and that's remarkable...But that doesn't change the fact that they're stuck in a story that's dull and predictable."
A clumsy urban thriller.
"Related to the 1953 Vincent Price film in name, embalming technique and Warner Bros. pedigree only, the new House of Wax is a dreary, predictable tale."
"As with so many horror movies, the setup is entrancing and it's the payoff which is hugely anticlimactic."
"Wyatt Earp is essentially a biopic, but it's a biopic in search of a subject. For all its attention to period detail and the many stages in a picturesque life, the film can't decide whether to honor the man, the myth or both."
The Yankeeness of it all is a bit much.
"It's a dense thatch of superficial brilliance with nothing to hold it up, like Gondry has tried to build a house that's all roof."
"Not utterly charmless ""Groundhog Day"" variation, with a less-irritating-than-usual Adam Devine."
"Director Peyton Reed doesn't quite bring the sharpness, litheness and attention to detail he brought to Bring It On and Down With Love to The Break-Up, which is nonetheless alternately funny and painful."
Nothing against Idris Elba or Tilda Swinton but Three Thousand Years of Longing just doesn&apos;t have the magic&#46;
"Dunno about the Earth, but time certainly stands still for a goodly portion of Scott Derrickson's expensively produced but utterly boneheaded remake."
An exercise in style.
The New Guy is no different than a hundred or so other films of its ilk %u2013 except possibly on the decibel level: It may well be the noisiest movie I've ever encountered.
Bruce Willis contributes little more than a cameo but Megan Fox does her best with the weak material.
"The jaw-drop factor that comes from seeing Carano's moves is often spoiled because of too much cutting or, in the case of the dance club sequence, excess strobing."
"Midnight Special gets lost in its once-enchanting ambiguity, and delivers a sci-fi story with far too many questions and not enough gripping clarity."
A xlunky&#44; shallow and contrived dark comedy with not enough laughs&#44; wisdom or emotional depth&#46; 
Gartner makes a hash of the game scenes and must resort to voiceover sportscasters to explain what's happening.
As slow as molasses and just as exciting.
"Fanning feels wafer-thin and out of her element. She's appropriately wan, but as we never know Effie's potential, her loss of identity has minimal punch."
"A film about wannabes who use attitude and bluster to emulate their inspirations, this ersatz blockbuster ends up seeming a little too much like its heroes."
"Based on a script by George Wing (""50 First Dates""), co-writer/director John Jeffcoat's struggles with timing and tone are the main drawbacks to this mini cinematic vacation to Mumbai, Bombay."
"The concept of a woman being a ""winner"" and of being the best version of herself because she has a better understanding of ""what men want""? That ain't it."
"Petite Maman just feels too artificial in execution and forced in concept for me to have the kind of emotional response that I know Sciamma is trying to elicit from her viewer, and I really wish that weren't the case."
Writer/director Kenneth Lonergan's MANCHESTER BY THE SEA made me leave the theater feeling empty... it could easily be filed away as just another white male angst narrative.
"You expect [Gomez] to hold up her fingers on both hands and shout, ""I'M THIS MANY!"""
"Opens with its mind nicely intact, suffers a major crisis about 30 minutes in, then bad turns to worse."
It's said that Ms. Witherspoon was paid $15 million for this. And I think she needs to cut in those of us who slogged our way through this rehash of Legally Blonde because we had to.
"The film's visual construction is spare, drawing power from its locations and quietly matted miniatures, though ultimately it succumbs to powering a series of cheap thrills."
"Shows some promise in that it wants to say something, but there are plenty of forgettable moments to go along with it."
"The fruit here isn't low-hanging; it's on the ground rotting, impossible to make a meal of."
"The Protégé isn't groundbreaking cinema, and often feels proudly aware of the fact."
It was brilliant as a one-man stage show; it was never a good candidate for film.
"During every savage attack, the audience laughed uproariously. Is this what we've come to?"
"The utter absence of humor, charm, originality, or intelligence leaves this to rank among the worst of all recent teen comedies."
"The Marksman does just enough with its familiar premise to be an adequately entertaining Western outing. However, the noticeable shortcomings here leave a lot to be desired."
Another flat one sided look at a rock idol that&#8217;s never bold enough to challenge our perceptions of them&#46;
"Inept to the core, The Vampire's Assistant never rises to the occasion."
What we have here is a perversion of the 'business as usual' recommendations we've been hearing lately.
"There's no nuance, no reflective downtime, and it ends with what may be the worst cod-psychology scene of all time. It all comes down to daddy issues, apparently. Oh, boo-hoo."
"If Hill keeps signing on for half-hearted romps into the realm of idiocy like The Sitter and 21 Jump Street, he's going to get shoved aside by whatever chubby comic wunderkind is lurking behind him."
"What opens as a delightful kid-friendly drama closes as a stumbly, manipulative yawner."
[A] mediocre sequel to one of 2001's most unexpected pleasures.
"If Tim Burton had made 'Twilight' on an off day, the result would have been something like this."
"If I believed in life eternal with access to a heavenly multiplex I still wouldn't advise you to see this film, but, as things stand, if thou goest anywhere this week, be it to see an honest piece of graven imagery, not this religiose rubbish."
"Cruise control indeed, as in slow and phoned-in, coasting by on what is passed off as thrills."
Baywatch makes CHIPS look like Citizen Kane.
Horrible dialogue throughout.
"They should call this overloud, underwhelming movie Real Steal."
A stick-thin expose of a gaggle of brats obsessed with snatching Prada purses and Alexander McQueen shoes from celebs' high-up-in-the-hills chateaus.
"Wes Ball's film version of the popular young-adult novel by James Dashner never makes much sense. Perhaps it would make more if you have read the book, but until they start handing out free copies before the movie starts, that cannot be a requirement."
"Much of the time, watching Beyond the Black Rainbow is accompanied by head scratching, but perhaps that's the point of this trippy outing."
"Get past the stunt casting, and The Matador has very little to offer, despite all the hubbub surrounding it."
Samuel L. Jackson pulls off an extremely terrifying performance in this formulaic thriller which looses all of its sizzle with an AWFUL ending.

"It's an odd, puzzling film."

Ends up stranded between two concepts.
"Romantic longing has never really been part of Herzog's cinematic vocabulary (love in his films typically looks like manic obsession), which may explain why some of it is more stiff than emotionally moving."
"It all adds up. But the result isn't always more, sometimes it adds up to less. [Full review in Spanish]"
It's a beautifully rendered outline without an animating spark.
"Like Alice, Tim Burton uses his trip down the rabbit hole to reassert his ""muchness"". There is much to look at, as a result, but not much about which to wonder."
Edge of Darkness' moments of tension and excitement arrive in so many fits and starts that it never comes together cohesively to make a palatable potboiler.
"Sweet Miley Cyrus drama depicts first love, family troubles."
The film is framed so deliberately as a prelude to more exciting times to come in its sequels that it renders the ending oddly anti-climactic.
"Despite his eccentric characters, the whole experience never has a payoff worthy of its lengthy two hour run-time, Gilliam remains his own worst enemy; which is the need for artistic freedom, but never having the courage of saying enough is enough."
I can't wait to see if the sequel has them going to Russia to stop prostitute trafficking or perhaps back in time to Chicago to stop liquor smuggling during prohibition.
"As Driven demonstrates, it's possible for a movie to be so preposterous and so completely clueless about its own stupidity that it's almost fun."
"There is undoubtedly a funny social satire to be set in a Christian high school, but Saved! is neither bold nor insightful enough to be it."
"Winterbottom takes it to the opposite extreme, turning into a docudrama and following that genre's pre-established format."
"In short, I did not like it though I'll still line up for Armipour's third feature."
Murnau's version of the story of the man who sold his soul to the Devil (Jannings) in return for youth is visually extraordinary but dismally uneven in terms of its dramatic effect.
This eighty-six-minute feature falls far from the enchantment most of the public will enter expecting.
"As is often the case in the business of follow-ups, the new effort pales in comparison to the funny, smart, sassy and, it says here, less outrageously violent original. . . It's as over the top as it gets."
"Craig heads a good cast in a largely unknown WWII tale of siblings who created a commune of warriors that contested the myth of Jews as passive victims, and while the subject is intriguing, Zwick's helming and film's execution leave much to be desired."
"'Wish Upon' is not a disaster, but it is a film that addresses terror in a so decaffeinated way that it is impossible to get into the story it is telling us. [Full review in Spanish]"
Directed by Sylvester Stallone &#40;who even has a cringeworthy cameo&#41;&#44; you can spot the crumbs of a Rocky movie that just don&apos;t belong&#46;
Documentary about injustice piles on facts still needs to make a cinematic case [with] better graphics and clearer explanations. . .Fire images visually drown out reasoning.
"The cast is good and the themes are compelling, but the execution is a bit of a mess."
"The edges and nicks are what distinguish us from one another, and from the get-go this couple feels gel-capped. That's a real problem ..."
"Pakula, when he is not indulging in subjective camera, strives to give his film the look of structural geometry, but despite the sharp edges and dramatic spaces and cinema presence out of Citizen Kane, it all suggests a tepid, rather tasteless mush."
"The result is a movie of great craft and wonderful images, lacking a heart."
"I can only hope that this precious tome has been unmercifully butchered in its trip from the page to the screen because if it actually is faithful, then what that says about the collective taste of its rabid fan base is too depressing to contemplate"
It's preposterous schlock masquerading as art.
"Too often, rather than a simmering pressure cooker of repressed hormones, this plays out like St Trinians without the jokes."
"This is a negative five. This is probably the worst movie of the year...it's so bad, halfway through the movie, I wondered if I was in a Jacob's Ladder scenario..."
"Not worth ""Meeting"""
"If only the director didn't see the rest of humanity as found art, and himself as its appraisor!"
"""Wild Nights"" goes too far at times, threatening to reduce the writer's life to the punchline of a literary version of Rodney Dangerfield: She got no respect."
"This pleasant but eminently forgettable indie comedy is the sort of thing that makes you wonder whether the big names in the cast were having serious career problems, doing someone a favor, or just had a few weeks to kill."
"Too dark and cumbersome as a comedy, too weak and unlikely as a drama, this retro Ritchie wannabe has an eye-catching cast but can't decide between the cartoon and the kitchen sink."

"Bigelow and Boal want to make a moral howl of a movie that burns with felt life, but they wind up with a failure of historical imagination that undermines a harrowing true story."
The Limits of Control contains all the wonderful things that only Jim Jarmusch can do but lacks some of the necessary things that Jarmusch either can't or won't do.
"Okay spoof comedy, but missing a lot of the charm of Zucker movies."
"Completely unremarkable and pedestrian in every sense, a speeding train hurtling toward an impending doom has never seemed so dull."
"Freeheld is a time capsule of tactful, half-hearted advocacy."
"As it is, the film only barely scrapes by as a crowd-pleaser. Unfortunately, a majority of the songs that break up the slender narrative are not that memorable."

A textbook example of the hazards of hiring a writer to adapt his own novel.
The silliest movie you'll see this summer.
Jason Segel and Rooney Mara are an unlikely central pairing in this low-key sci-fi about the discovery of an afterlife.
"Readers of the best-selling novel may be satisfied. The rest of us may well find it tough work, at times, to get through it."
"The Black Swan is balletic and bombastic. It soars and bumbles, pirouettes and postures. It fights a featherweight war with heavyweight pretensions."
"The story never comes into its own, only skimming the surface of Barrie's obsession and failing to grasp the psychological ties underlying his most intimate relationships."
"90 percent of it isn't bad enough to be funny, while 100 percent of it isn't good enough to be good."
There's a locked-room mystery going on inside Kevin's head. But Split shows too little of the individual selves for viewers to develop a stake in puzzling out who's up to what.

Sci-fi thriller/teen romance isn't as good as the book.
"A barren movie full of new-style cliches and bereft of the Gothic thrills, virtuoso scenes and screw-twisting suspense that might make it interesting or fun to watch."
"Well-intentioned but equally disappointing...United 93 is harrowing and authentic; this picture is earnest but old-fashioned, obvious and curiously plodding."
Figuratively and literally a minor league movie.
Dowdle has the skills to bring the best out of an enclosed setting à la Neil Marshall's fantastic The Descent. Shame the similarities end there.

Choreography is all that's on offer here. The increasingly convoluted fight scenes turn into lifeless spectacle in this ugly franchise.
"Neither Jackson nor the ""Rare Exports"" writer-director are gonzo enough to make this come off."
What you’re left with isn’t a dream brought to life so much as another efficient baby-sitting machine. Winsor McCay deserved something better.

It's impossible to imagine the Almighty actually endorsing the kind of shoddy workmanship that has turned ...'The Bad Seed' into what ought to be titled 'The Bad Stem Cell.'
"It's the curious fact that for a man so revered, a movie about his life should be so unexceptional."
"Brand has had a jam-packed life, but by trying to get all of it into the film's relatively brief run time, most of it ends up becoming a blur with only the stuff involving the creatures he hopes to de-extinct getting a chance to breathe."
An embarrassment of near epic proportions.
"Sacrifices last traces of plausibility and common sense for the sake of ""surprise"" twist that any experienced viewer could have predicted ages ago."
"...as Leitman admits, she knew nothing about pro-wrestling before making the movie, and she still doesn't seem to know much."

Woeful and meandering...Reiner's direction is uncharacteristically choppy and uneventful
"A festival favorite, Perrier's Bounty is one of those comedic British crime thrillers I just can't quite figure out what the fuss is all about."
"Substitute 1940s fighters for spaceships, move them closer to Earth, and you have the audience appeal of this movie."
"It's a solemnly preposterous piece of designer revenge pulp, with actors who stand around bathed in red and blue light like David Lynch mannequins in between scenes of torture and murder."
It's all so ridiculous and implausible.
A small-scale Australian musical with an appealing no-name cast whose charms are obscured by directorial self-indulgence.
This movie is deadly.
"... the narrative descends into retro boredom and, instead of something gripping and intellectually capable, you'll find occasional sincerity but few emotion."
It's a movie more concerned with details like Jim Bowie's terminal case of consumption than it is with the historical context of its story and its legendary characters.
An underwhelming pirate saga.
"For all its posturing (it's based on the books by Gideon Defoe, who also wrote the script) and visual lan, Pirates never really raises anchor."
"All actors have a movie or two that they would like to forget. Matthew McConaughey, Penelope Cruz and William H. Macy should put this preposterous action-adventure flick at the top of their lists."
You are caught up in a morality play... the deepest significance of which the makers of this PG movie are apparently betting the adolescents of America will instinctively comprehend.
"...it's an insipid confection of cloying hopefulness, bubblegum teen spirit and self-reflexive clever quips."
Couldn't that billionaire Arthur afford to treat us to a better show?
"Sure, the film is fitfully amusing on a moment-to-moment basis. But less than a week later, I'd already forgotten I even saw it."
You're better off watching the documentary that inspired the film in the first place than watching the film itself.
"Looks and feels like one big, long commercial."
This is a film for people who find cereal-packet philosophy a bit taxing.
"Mark Walhberg is solid in this predictable flick about a blue-collar father walking across America to fight bullying of his gay son, but Reid Miller is a revelation as the kid."
"There's nothing innately wrong with Alston's documentary, other than that it seems to lack a cohesive focus."
"Without a Paddle wants to fascinate us with our own repulsion, and the wraparound, absurdly sentimental story is there to fill space between obvious and appalling sight gags."
There's a reason why the poster for Taking Lives is better than the movie itself-those lips ain't made for talking.
"Too bad the central character is someone you wouldn't want to spend five minutes with, let alone an hour and a half."
"A big, bloated disaster of a movie you could almost call the Heaven's Gate of its generation."

It can be nearly impossible to watch at times.

A picture whose wildly different components never really coalesce into a satisfying whole.
The film flatlines the moment anyone draws a blade.
"Had Cave written The Proposition as a song, the vague grotesquerie and simple, primal storytelling might've been an asset."
Never shows enough passion to be interestingly bad.
"Enjoyable on a superficial level and attractively made, Caf Society is not Woody Allen at his very best. As always, though, his sublime taste in music makes up for much of the lack-lustre screenplay"

This one's kind of boring but pretty well made.
"For the first time in its 25-year existence, Pixar has created an utterly ordinary film."
"Ambition only carries the viewing experience so far, as most of the effort is strangled by a persistent unpleasantness and Gondry's tone-deaf way with establishing sympathy for this public transit motley crew."
"A miscalculated piece damaged by poor direction, mediocre writing and performances that feel consistently misguided and off-key."
"Not only a blatant ripoff of 'National Lampoon's Vacation,' it's a lousy one besides."

"The German Doctor is skillfully made and acted, but without any sense of spontaneity or surprise - qualities required for any decent thriller."

What a piece of tripe (no offense to tripe)!
"It treads on the same treacly territory as the worst of Nicholas Sparks, and features a stunning lack of urgency that leaves the film as dull as it is preposterous."
"For all the profanity (quite a bit) and sexual sass, this CBS Films product plays even more like a TV movie than its debut project, Extraordinary Measures."
"Where real reality shows freak out about their contestants' murky pasts, this one openly exploits its damaged-goods participants."
Famuyiwa has made a mostly charming movie despite its cliche milieu.

It's as if everybody involved in The Snowman knew from the start that this wasn't going to work and agreed to put forth the minimum effort required to get it over with.
"I enjoy a crazy car chase as much as the next person, but I prefer them to come wrapped in a context that makes me care about who's chasing whom, and why."
"Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?"
"No '8 1/2,' but it has its points of interest, even if as a whole it's as frustrating as its title character."
"It still works as a cautionary tale of man vs. nature hubris, but the endgame finger-pointing among survivors, their families, and one amazing Nepalese sherpa leaves the viewer frustrated."
"The expectation is that Pixar movies will continue to take animation and family storytelling upwards, but ""Onward"" doesn't move the needle as much as it should."
"Margot Robbie is unstoppable as Harley Quinn, but the screenplay fails this DC Comics adaptation."
"Contrived and not always credible, Sharper tells a story that drops con atop con."
Georgiana seems to get dumber as the years go on instead of learning how to play the game. Blame the hats and rent Atonement.
Salva squanders all of his original movie's not-entirely- awfulness and bumbles into the realm of unintentional comedy.
"The new robot is a disappointment. Instead of the endearingly low-tech fireplug of yore that warned Will Robinson of encroaching danger, the new machine is all bells and whistles and no fun at all. Kinda like the movie itself."
"The film is done in the classic 2-D animation style and embraces the flat, colorful, Saturday-morning cartoon look and feel."
This is the sort of film that'll make you think cinema is dead.
"Of its many failings, the biggest drawback to ""Pacific Rim"" is the sci-fi fantasy's presentation as anything other than children's movie."
"Unfortunately, what the film lacks is a good story, good characters, and good humor."
Seance is more a stumble than a home-run.
"It's not even fun to hate-watch Transformers: The Last Knight. At this point, even writing this review feels like enabling bad behavior."
"This is predictable and very silly stuff, but there are some solid laughs."
... a cheesy sword-and-sandal flick that tries too hard to impress.
"It contains memorable dialogue, vivid characters and several superb scenes, and yet it still manages to be wrong, a complete miscalculation."
"Oh my goodness, it's a ripoff of Die Hard. A shameless ripoff that gets more and more shameless the longer it goes on..."
Predictable and slight.
"A motley mix of a film - police procedural, violent thriller, and suburban marital angst - that ends up being less than the sum of its parts."
"The costumes are neat, the photography is great -- all the pieces are on hand, but they don't fit."
What an odd movie!
"It's simply not a movie, not as it stands. It's a five-minute demo reel stretched to feature length."
"The players are not so much teens as miniature adults, dissecting their own natures with insightfulness that typically comes through decades of reflection, if it comes at all."
Some sh*tty slo-mo action scenes. Some toothless scares.
"While Foy proves she's a steely-eyed Salander, this bitty and breakneck adaptation of the David Lagercrantz bestseller isn't one for the books."
Little more than a series of not-always-good special effects strung together.
A documentary just as childish as the title suggests.
Ellis's big notions are less insightful than they pretend to be.
A stylish if formulaic addition to the seemingly endless onslaught of crime films that dominated the Hong Kong cinema of the late Eighties.
"On the surface. Jade looks like it should be a sexy thriller. Turns out it's just another visit to Joe Eszterhas World, where all the sex is nasty, all the men are corrupt and all the tedium is unbroken."
"I would be more circumspect about Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil, especially if you're taking children."
...succeeds neither as an action flick nor as a balls-to-the-wall comedy...
"The only thing Sara serves is lame, stereotypical humor coupled with predictable shenanigans."
"Trapped inside what looks like a Marina del Rey condo complex, the principals raise and lower the blinds, run up and down the stairs and occasionally venture outside, while the audience, if it has the energy, yells: ""No! Don't do that! That's stupid!"""
"Hollywood's hottest club is The Book of Henry. This movie has everything: sniper rifles, Jacob Tremblay doing magic, and Naomi Watts playing the mandolin"
Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk ultimately commits the greatest crime a war film can. It tells you how to feel.
"[W]ants to have its pseudoscience cake and eat it too... The entire endeavor is laughable and ludicrous, a victim of its own misplaced earnestness."
"Too many crooks spoil the broth -- or, more precisely, the bloodbath -- in a wild-and-crazy crime spree that's a whole lot less than the sum of its parts."
"The story beats are as familiar as they come, and there are a few halfhearted stabs at redeeming Roberts's clueless character when it would have been better to push her feeble-mindedness to Anna Faris-esque extremes."
"The story is boring, the action scenes are fine as far as they go, but the whole thing's a waste of time. Don't waste your time."
Resurgence is a movie that tries too hard to recapture the natural aspects of it's predecessor while trying to introduce new plot elements that you hope that can be figured out in future movies.
Maybe she's weighed down by the big hair but [Brie] Larson is left with the least interesting role.
"But I'd hate for you to think that the film does anything radical, like present Yellow Hawk and his family as complicated human beings. The Native Americans here are strictly one-dimensional, which is all Blocker's redemption requires."
"Once the real game begins, the humor starts to miss and the plot points get ridiculously unbelievable. While Smith shows flashes of his classic charisma, Robbie is under-used and no one else is around to step up and make us care."
"A slight improvement in style, but unfortunately, the movie still lags behind in the script and character departments."
"Once you've boogied out to Harold Faltermeyer's self-parodic ""Axel F""-style music, it's all downhill from there. [Blu-ray]"
"By the end, one's senses are numb, even as the memory of certain amusing killings briefly flicker in the back of one's mind."
A film as boring as its title is grammatically incorrect and long.
"They never quite cohere, and both ultimately lack the very bite missing from Katherine's fictional talk show-the closest to a truly withering gag here is Ike Barinholtz's amusing Dane Cook impersonation, though even that's a little past its sell date."
"Crank: High Voltage, starring Jason Statham as a man with a machine instead of a heart, is boorish, bigoted and borderline pornographic."
"Hostel is depraved, sick and disgusting - which means teenagers should love it."
"Here, the jokes are their own feeble reason for being; some are mildly funny, but most just fall flat with a dull clunk."
Consists of a barrage of poorly staged fight scenes and dialogue that not even Arnold Schwarzeneggar in Conan the Barbarian could bring himself to utter.
"It's the stuff of Saturday-morning cartoons, but Mangold - who, as in the appalling 'Knight and Day', edits all action sequences on the shaky frapp setting - hasn't the visual pop or lightness of touch to make it bounce."
A retread of all those buddies-in- the-cop-car pictures of the 1980s; not even slightly dusted off.
"After Earth, a witless, banal, tedious, melodramatic special-effects fest that is disappointing from the opening sequence until the credits role."
"Davenport makes desultory attempts to bring in other mothers, but she is not an interviewer adept at drawing out scintillating observations."
"""The Choice"" aims to pull its audience's heartstrings&#151;really, this is its only aim&#151;but each narrative step is so rigidly prefabricated it is difficult to feel much of anything."
"Though Dame Judi is superb, of course, even her character gets lost in the chaos. Overall, this famous stage play fluffs its lines on screen."
Doesn't rise above anything you're likely to see on an average Saturday morning.
"Wahlberg is simply miscast, out of his depth, and the overly long, poorly edited Father Stu never finds its rhythm. Good at humor, sweet with regret but the film ironically ends up short when it comes to the most important part: handling faith itself."
"For whatever reason, The Highwaymen exists."
A flat and tedious action film.
Devotion -- despite that title -- does not offer [Top Gun] Maverick’s patriotic uplift. It’s stuck between uncovering Brown’s victimization and deflating American valor.
"I have seen more heat and more skin in late-night offerings on Cinemax. I've seen more realistic romance in young-adult movies, and I've seen better acting by furniture."
"Triangle of Sadness needn’t be a fair film... A more carefully shaped argument would have been appreciated, though. And one that didn’t dissolve so quickly into a juvenile snicker."
"As we watch, the thought keeps returning, over and over: Why watch these people? What's the point? Film anybody's trip to Italy, and it would be more interesting than this, or at least equally boring."
"Good song based on it. The film blows, even if you like cheesy junk (which I do)."
"The true story behind Dog Day Afternoon is fascinating fodder for a documentary, but The Dog squanders this by letting its sociopath subject run the show."
"A Kleenex film, something someone wishes to discard as quick as possible.  [Full review in Spanish] "
Atmospheric but awkward drama.
"Valiant is amiable enough, but there's little in the humor or story that could be considered fresh."
There&#8217;s no sense of cosmic justice here&#44; just bad things happening to a bad person it&#8217;s impossible to care about&#46;
"If Sahara weren't quite so dumb, it might have been a lot of fun."
The quirky meter hits red early and often in the disappointing Away We Go
"The awfulness ranges from terrible judgement calls, such as the deranged soundtrack, cardboard sets and hilariously OTT grimness, to more surreal errors, like star Sam Riley using the voice of the dog off That's Life who could bark the word ""sausages""."
"This woefully botched mystery-adventure-thriller-caper-romance-comedy, or whatever it was meant to be, is no fun at all."
"It sounds fun. It's a little fun. For a while. But Bekmanbetov shoots every killing spree like an addled gamer, working that slow-down-speed-up kill-shot cliche like a maniac."
Shazam might be the hero that delivers a spark to the DCU in the future but this movie leaves you with only a flicker instead of a flame&#46; 
"Further proof that [Tarantino] may have a knack for turning trash into treasure as a director, but the films he champions are usually just trash."
Do your hair at home.
"You'll be engrossed for much of the film but in the end, you'll probably walk out thinking, ""what was all that build-up for?"""
"Unable to evoke empathy or forestall snickers, particularly once you've seen it all the way through and reflect on the whole."
A definite nominee for the worst kids movie of all-time.
"For a far superior meditation on bereavement, better to turn to Moretti's portrayal of a grieving father in 2002's The Son's Room."
"A ""Human Centipede"" ass-to-mouth concertina of gruesome misogyny and utter tedium."
it feels natural that the actors are what keep the more superfluous scenes from weighing down De Felitta's film
"The film has an almost pathological need to ensure that everything turns out well for every single character, while at the same time eliding any truly difficult issues."
"Fundamentally silly the film may be, but it never graduates to spryness."
"If it weren't played so very straight, this jaw-dropping thriller might pass for an accurate satire of Hollywood self-indulgence. Instead, it serves as a prime example."
...[the film is] dominated by jokes that aren't terribly funny and abandons the more absurd nature of the first film's comedy.
"Darabont and screenwriter Michael Sloane's misty-eyed tribute may be pleasant in places, but it's too manufactured and deliberate to be persuasive."
"The film wobbles precariously on terra firma, and doesn't quite know what to do with its supposed real heroes or its preposterous plot. But at least Core has chosen his actors well."
"Overplayed: there are entirely too many beaming smiles and emotional flip-outs...the only reason to see this movie is Foster, whose overplaying somehow succeeds at charming where her costars fail. [Blu-Ray]"
"In the end, this is a movie that makes the original Basic Instinct look good. And in a way, that's quite a feat."
It just sits there in the water.
This latest collection of stunts from Johnny Knoxville and his crew of masochistic nutters achieves at least one distinction: it showcases the most pointless use of 3D in movies.
"For those expecting more from the pedigree of those involved, it's a fairly flat and forgettable dramedy."
"Man, it's tough sitting through a satire made by somebody with no sense of humor -- welcome to Talking Points: The Movie."
I'm torn - half of me thinks this is worth seeing and the other half says wait to rent it or see it on cable.
"I do realize that, if spread thinly, reincarnation can add a little relish to a film plot. This it certainly does in Dead Again, but so many gimmicks have been mixed into this melodrama that the narrative becomes very hard to digest."
"This is a film of gimmicks, most of them rather tired."
The easy chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson cannot save Men in Black: International from becoming the blandest entry in the series.
"This sibling revelry smackdown sting defeats its own elaborate cinematic narrative scheme, by failing to take itself seriously when ensuing dramatic events scream for it to do so."
The cult 1960s TV series gets royally shafted by Hollywood in this stunningly designed blockbuster that's stunningly awful in every other department.
"Shot on location in Greece, but the way Meryl Streep tears through the scenery, you'd think she was in a giant reptile suit on the back lot at Toho."
The running-gag emotional expression of another of the film's autistic characters pretty much sums it up: 'Heavy sigh.'
A promising cast is hamstrung by its emotionless premise.
"Mark Twain said, 'the human race has one really effective weapon, and that is laughter.' Perhaps that page was torn out of the filmmakers' used copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide"
"There's a cartoonish quality to ""The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard, although the cartoon is dreary."
The film's Achilles' heel proves to be this sense of survivor's guilt that's too often M.I.A.
A mediocre Tom Cruise mystery thriller that's entertaining in the moment but instantly forgettable.
"It took forever, and I wanted to purge."
"If you love Edward Snowden, you'll probably enjoy Snowden. If you have mixed feeling about Edward Snowden, you'll probably have mixed feeling about Snowden."
It's hard to imagine another comedy coming along this year that is this abrasive and free of laughs. It's like everyone involved intentionally tried to create a horrible movie.
"Steamboy is breathtakingly detailed and ambitious beyond anything I have ever seen in the realm of animation. But the chase goes on much too long, and Ray and Scarlett are never still long enough to develop any inner resonance or romantic rapport."
I dare you to tell me this isn't a 'Final Destination' ripoff.
"Weighted down with slow, uninvolving storytelling and flat acting."
"Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works."
"While there's something intrinsically funny about Sir Anthony Hopkins saying 'Get in the car, bitch,' this Jerry Bruckheimer production has little else to offer"
It's a confusing and confused mix of genres and tactics.
"If there's a point to this, it's what Herzog's point always is: That obsession can drive you nuts. I'm not sure I needed a freaky German traipsing through the jungle for 2 1/2 hours to drive that point home."
"Skip The Mountain Between Us. If you're in the mood to be cloyed, watch a Hallmark movie instead."
"Deadpool flipped the bird at superhero flicks with an irreverent, profane and hilarious meta sendup of the genre, and Deadpool 2 is more of the same."
"Its cold, angry, and very lost with exactly four people to save everyone all of the time. Every crowd scene descends into rioting and madness, and were left to believe that Wizards are just magically-inclined sheep waiting for the right megalomaniac."
"The battles look great with computer renderings, but outside the Kraken sequence they don't inspire an ounce of awe. The gods have never looked more real, or mattered less"
"Lots of heart, eye candy, and likable characters, but its lack of more grit, believability, and substance stops it from truly inspiring."
All efforts to add zest to a serious subject fail.
Michael Douglas seems to have been slithering toward this part for 40 years
"A lame, predictable comedy."
"A labored, implausible piece of action-movie hack work."
"Though the ingredients are potent, their blending here mostly comes off as formulaic, humdrum and sometimes unintentionally laughable."
"An exploitation movie about people lacking even a modicum of common sense--in this case '50s era Southerners--writer/director Deborah Kampmeier's ""Hounddog"" is an insult to its audience and to the actors that signed on for her abysmal experiment."
"A parody of bourgeois French cinema, and the focus on the comically transparent autofictions of the hapless writer, Léonard, mimicked classic Woody Allen - not in a good way."
"The Knack... is yet another example of the danger of messing about with someone else's work, especially something so quirkishly self-contained and carefully planned as Ann Jellicoe's play."
"They've promised us that this will be the last Shrek film, and please let it be true."
"Cretton builds up a good deal of dramatic credibility in The Glass Castle, only to have it undermined by generic and artificial epiphanies more suited to Lifetime Channel melodramas than this sincere approximation of realism."
The most disappointing part of Vice is that Bale's commitment to the role is wasted on a cheesy script that tries too hard to fit McKay's style instead of being tonally consistent.
"Racing Stripes follows a story arc similar to Babe, but it possesses none of the warmth, humor, or originality of that film."
The entire finished product feels like it was just rushed out into theaters as quick as possible.
Horrible Bosses 2 does worse than just live in the shadow of the predecessor it so slavishly imitates: it makes one doubt whether the original can still be of value if something cast from its mold can be this feeble.
It's so painfully unfunny we're not sure it can legally be called a comedy.
Tom George showed a commendable level of control in his debut&#44; but Chappell&#8217;s screenplay is so disheveled that no amount of sincerity from Ronan or lovable schmuck shtick from Rockwell can level it out&#46;
"By the end, one almost wishes another tornado would descend and wash away these subnormal characters for whom there is neither redemption nor purpose in life."
There's a reason 'Citizen Kane' didn't devote half the movie to the home life of the reporter investigating Rosebud.
[The script] reduces some of the more complex themes of maturation to something resembling an R-rated after-school special.
plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure Hollywood.
"Mirren brings a kind of feisty annoyance that transcends the rest of the material, which alternates between bland comedy and bland drama."
"For romantic comedy, it is not particularly romantic or funny."
The film's two-hour length is unbearable for an animated feature.
"Nothing says Valentine's Day like a machete wielding, hockey mask wearing psycho killer! Go for the laughs, not for the shocks or the screams."
A movie that preys on nostalgia but doesn&#8217;t know what to do with any of it&#44; and a film with a massive scale that gets pared down to the same tricks as before&#44; Jurassic World Dominion brings the franchise to an unsatisfying close&#46;
As always Travolta is urban gorgeous and very charming. The rest of the film is neither.
I was too traumatized by the indignities that happened prior to enjoy any of the violent mayhem that followed.
"In trying to be sensitive to such a controversial issue, O Jerusalem glazes over important events settling for mediocrity while giving a history lesson more appropriate for high school."
It has sexy leads and great costumes but there's little else to recommend this lukewarm Nazi-era potboiler that might have been made (and likely should have stayed) in the 1940s.
"""Terminator: Genisys"" might have seen less contrived, if Mr. S had settled for a back seat. Instead, the writers strenuously wrote the story for him. And, instead of fresh, we get overly complicated and hard-to-buy-into plot points."
"Writer-director Richard LaGravenese introduces characters and loses track of them, builds toward a mildly daring ending and backs cravenly away from it, even seems to contradict himself ..."
"Refuses to get its toes wet, instead retreating into goody-goody fantasy."
"Manages to be ugly, stupid, offensive, depressing, sexist and boring in equal measures."
It should have borrowed some charm.
Mission to Mars gets lost in mystical mumbo jumbo.
The funniest Antarctic thriller of 2009!!!
It would've been a straight-to-video thing if its star wasn't named 'Mel Gibson'. [Full review in Portuguese.]
This is a film that prefers the version of Han Solo where Greedo shoots first.
The rest is nothing more than a compendium of action scenes filmed in a pedestrian way and without inspiration. [Full review in Spanish]
A film that is more burdensome than fascinating. [Full review in Spanish]
"...chaotic cinematography capturing unsympathetic characters in illogical stories. At least Wingard honored the anthology's title with his medium - most of the other shorts are clearly digital, so why would they have ended up on VHS cassettes?"
"It starts with a bang, but ultimately, the wheels come off this covered wagon."
LLittle more than a string of music videos in search of a script.
"Like an alien trapped in a human host, a better movie is itching to burst out of ""Men in Black 3."""
It's Finding Nemo gutted of all its charm and remixed for urban hit radio.
[Jarecki's] analysis is far too simplistic.
"Spin it however they like, the troubled but talented Lohan isn't what's wrong with this misbegotten mess."
"Kinda Goofy, very Dumbo."
"Avoid ""Blended"" like it's your job - because it is. Your future happiness could depend on it."
The most overrated movie of the year (of all time?) by people who should know better.
"This is hardly the golden age of endings anyway (most are chosen by surveys), but this ending really is an assault -- on the brain."
"I think this topic might've been interesting as a documentary, but the film failed to engage me on any level."
"Many talented people, but especially Christian Bale are short-changed by his clouded vision. The brightly glaring digital photography doesn't help, but in the end the worst crime is that the story is just plain dull."
"The Double Hour obviously wants to be compared to efforts by the likes of Alfred Hitchcock, Brian De Palma and Christopher Nolan, but it's ultimately like watching a child clamoring to sit at the table of the grownups."
"Will Kate, too, fall for Nick? Only every single person watching the movie knows for sure."
"If you're in the mood for buffoonery, you'll probably enjoy this dumb-but-funny marathon of back-stabbing, physical gags, potty humor and appealing cast chemistry."
"Noe clearly isn't interested in sex as eroticism, but as a form of communication between people. Even so, Love comes off as an unlikable male-centric tale."
It's all very pretty. And pretty absurd.
The director&#8217;s latest reconfirms my original sentiments that M&#46; Night Shyamalan is a one-trick pony who isn&#8217;t the most exciting filmmaker&#46;&#10;&#10;
A so-so sophomoric space comedy.
"Occasionally scary, often laughably portentous, never explained."
"Really when you cut through all the garbage, Bart Freundlich presents us with an illusion of originality..."
"Meandering and glacially paced, and often just plain dull."
A high-fantasy action comedy of tedious slapstick and obvious punchlines you scry the instant a wannabe medieval wag opens their mouth&#46; It&#8217;s all borderline incoherent&#44; sketched in cheap-looking CGI&#46;
"And no, they do not eat any pudding."
Amounts to one compelling character surrounded by a bunch of stuff that's not so great.
"Mr. Allen might just as well have devoted his talents to man-eating goldfish, poodles on the rampage or carniverous canaries."
"Lacking in dramatic punch, animated only by mind-numbing action sequences and endless light-saber fights."
"A blithe homicidal romp set in backwoods Montana that hits the bullseye on charm, cleverness, sharp performances, and glib humor but misses the substance target altogether."
I don't think Reese Witherspoon's heavily marketed charm has worn thin it's just this particular character whose welcome has been blown out.
Richard Donner's latest buddy-action flick is thick with wrong decisions.
You have a movie that's constantly busy... but never really going anywhere.
"The gotchas aren't novel, particularly frightful or ghastly, or anything you haven't seen before; they just come via new gadgetry."
What else would you expect from a demented comedy about suicide?
More downhome carnage. Not for the weak of heart.
"[A] Babel-ish drama about the malaises wrought by globalisation, how we're closer than ever, and yet, if I'm not mistaken, farther apart. Unfortunately, you've seen it already."
"At times, it seems like ""And We Go Green"" is really a long commercial for Formula E, with a little soap opera among the drivers thrown in and a peek into the tech of the cars. But none of it rally stays on the road."
"Morbius is a mostly unlikeable mess. The lowest bar any superhero movie has to clear, is that it should at least be fun to watch. Morbius falls at the first hurdle."
"The overall tone of the film is jaunty, almost upbeat, the atmosphere that of an end-of-season trip with a lot of explosions."
"Although initially intriguing and always beautiful to look at (Westworld production designer Howard Cummings and his team are the real stars here), Reminiscence just doesn't have the goods in terms of tension or pace."
"Challenging authority as unpatriotic? Bah, humbug!"
Cuba Gooding Jr. [is] so animated a performer that he even appears to be overacting on this movie's poster.
"Must have seemed like quite the wheeze when greenlit, but now has all the appetising novelty of your eighth Zoom of the day."
"Nothing's particularly risky or original, but neither is anything all that repulsive."
The whole thing is very surface and frequently boring.
Low rent knockoff The 5th Wave is boring teenage wasteland.
The film is an embarrassment.
Ghost in the Shell struggles to dig below the surface of its thought-provoking concepts and bring real depth to its striking visuals.
"Ultimately, it's not hateful or anti-girl and if you happen to be 10 years old and female then you're probably going to love it."
"Look, XXX: Return of Xander Cage is bad. Is it too much to ask that the filmmakers simply acknowledge and embrace how bad it is?"
"Black's new movie is less the goofy, garish sequel we were hoping for and more an act of universe-building. But, hey, at least there's a bigger, badder Predator on the scene, one that looks like he's been doing CrossFit."
Not really a genre film&#44; and I&#8217;m also not sure I&#8217;d call it a &#8220;madcap comedy&#8221; pers&#233; -- I actually don&#8217;t even think I can fully recommend it&#46;
"Nothing - not the characters, not their stories and certainly not their violence - is meant to register deeply. Their words and worlds are disposable; it's no wonder they fade so fast."
Lame and preachy.
"Feels false and platitudinous -- a calculated crowd-pleaser that, despite being an original story, plays like a poorly condensed novel with a scripter unable to make choices."
...a seemingly foolproof premise that's employed to disastrously underwhelming (and uninvolving) effect...
Possibilities for The Adam Project loomed far larger than what’s on screen. And what’s on screen is never a credit to the sci-fi genre.
Earnest to a fault and afraid to say something that's actually honest.
"Ye's back-and-forth storytelling insinuates that the lives of Yu Hong and Zhou Wei are incomplete without each other, but because their young love was never convincing in the first place, the bittersweet conclusion rings hollow."
"The idea is better than the execution, unfortunately, although director Jim Sonzero does create a few extremely eerie moments."
Director Vicky Jenson has infused Post Grad with all the subtlety and substance of a garden-variety sitcom...
"Bethlehem qualifies as a promising debut for its first-time actors and director, but it's slack at first, and the thriller tricks it uses to ratchet up the tension later ... keep it from sneaking past your defenses."
Comic actors Steve Zahn and Jillian Bell are uncharacteristically earnest in this achingly well-intentioned but thuddingly heavy-handed family drama.
"Jai Ho Democracy declares itself to be a dud right from the opening, because of the sheer ineptness and flatness of execution."
"Kwapis stages everything like a sitcom, has no sense of pace, and buries the theme of late-life friendship under a haze of sentiment and trail dust. ""A Walk in the Woods"" could be called ""I Need a Walker to Get to the Woods."" It's a good walk spoiled."
A stunningly weak ending very nearly causes the entire film to collapse.
With &quot;Life Is Beautiful&#44;&quot; the final frontier of schmaltz has been reached&#46;
"[If you see it], see it for Wes Bentley's masterful, deadpan performance as the gaunt, aging eminence - 36 is like 75 in DJ years - who pulls his head out of a bottle long enough to do Zac Efron a favor."
Has all been done before. Again and again.
"Unfortunately, Jarecki is unable to stick to material that supports his indictment of the entire thrust of American foreign policy since WWII. Instead, Why We Fight is devoted to a one-sided indictment..."
"All the tie-dye, reefer, skinny-dipping, split-screen cinematography (from Eric Gautier) and acid-trip psychedelics courtesy of Tiber's encounter with hippies (Paul Dano and Kelli Garner) can't make up for the film's major sin of omission: the music."
Fewer laughs than the average episode of ITV's Benidorm.
"""Race"" is only faintly stirring, turning history into a dry reenactment."
"For any other filmmaker, this film would be a splendid Dahl adaptation. For Spielberg, it's far less than a dream come true."
"In all its binge-drinking, profanity-laced, vomit-soaked glory, the film's stupefying lack of self-awareness ends up being its biggest enemy."
"The intentions feel authentic, but not enough else does."
"You'll need all the navigational help you can get, lantern or otherwise, to make it through this unfocused, CGI-driven mess of a movie."
"Fun moments hang in the rafters, fading into the side streets of Broken City as Hughes attempts to coerce us into taking him seriously as an innovative director."
"A chokehold of a movie, grabbing us but not ultimately engaging us."
Even the incredible performance from Jonathan Rhys-Meyers cannot save the pacing issues and bad dialogue.
Virtually everything in the movie is off-pitch.
"The result, under the arrhythmic direction of the otherwise talented Elizabeth Banks, is a near-disaster-a comedy that isn't funny and a musical that isn't tuneful (and once again, this supposed a capella group doesn't sing unaccompanied)."
"Collateral Beauty is the worst kind of pandering pap. It is garbage psycho-babble masquerading as pop-philosophy, set in a Pottery Barn."
"The weird mix of humor is unsettling, as it plays against another tale that centers too much on violence against women."
Freddy Krueger is now a full-blown cartoonish caricature of his initially dread-induced former self.
"Suspiria has ""divisive"" written all over it, and will surely be a film that some find to be a true work of art while others, like me, write it off as pretentious nonsense."
There's an inherent disconnect with the material.
"It's a comedy where the laughs are considered first, the story second, and the characters least of all."
I slept while I watched!
"One action scene is underwater, but the rest of it drags so much it feels like it might be, too."
"The funeral scenes, though, move so quickly from high anguish to feelgood hugs that it's hard to go along without sniggering."
"It is hard to think of a movie squandering the opportunity of a perfectly timed cultural moment quite like ""The Boss."""
Terrible thriller wastes great actors in a ridiculous story.
"The stupidity lacks smarts in the script department, and the joke, such as it is, wears thin, then turns sour."
"The jokes are definitely 'dumb' (and therefore, it works in this film's context), but with a movie title that literally proclaims the same out loud, what can you expect?"
"Neither the movie nor the performance is memorable enough to cause much stir, and they will likely get lost amidst better end-of-the-year offerings."
"Story brims with implausibilities that rank high on the ""they wouldn't do that"" scale... and Wendkos' characters, despite the efforts of director David Burton Morris, are neither interesting or endearing."
"Turing is kept tweedy and neutered, as closeted in celluloid as he was in real life."
&#8220;Armageddon Time&#8221; wanted to say something relevant through its rearview mirror&#44; but wound up preachy and muddled&#46;
Pretty much everything here (whether it's the costume aesthetics or Reed's limbs stretching) looks like a pre-rendered scene from a PlayStation 2 game
"A film whose scares and, ultimately, jingoistic politics, feel plucked from a bygone era."
"Gray assumes rather than dramatizes the depths of his characters, scanning for gravitas where there are only rickety clichs"
"[Director] Ray interjects observations about his own travels like a backup musician who thinks he's the frontman. A little less cowbell, please."
"Why are the ""good guys"" in The Purge films such ace shooters? It seems the more symbolically dense and contemporary these films become, the less scary and more real they are."
"Con man movies aren't easy to pull off, and writer/director Rian Johnson's stylish attempt in 'The Brosthers Bloom' doesn't quite cut it."
"Really, who cares? The essence of the story has been lost in the process. Give me The Muppet Christmas Carol any day."
"While it's commendable that one of history's most despicable human-inflicted tragedies is brought to light, Bitter Harvest leaves viewers bitter for all the wrong reasons."
"As a one-off, memory-lane reboot sequel to the franchise (and by extension, the 1992 animated film), cursed to be released unceremoniously late due to a global pandemic, Tom & Jerry could have been far less watchable."
It's basically just an excuse for Leonardo DiCaprio to play Jason Bourne while Scott once again turns his technical expertise towards making Morocco look pretty.
"Alice, of Alice in Wonderland fame, is dead to me now. Alice Through the Looking Glass has killed her off as a viable character for a movie."
"Adding 45 minutes to the adaptation doesn't improve it, especially in the protracted epilogue. The most egregious addition is a Holocaust subplot that may be poignant, but it is entirely extraneous."
"Even if you're dying to see it, I bet you can wait until it hits video in a couple months."
"It's a film that so desperately wants to be funny, but isn't sure how."
"""Dumbo"" is flat, even its airborne moments lacking magic."
"Muntean offers some insight into the routine reality of this Romanian businessman, but ultimately the film sidesteps exploring the moral dilemma that at first seems to be its raison d'être."
"Even for such a transparently commercial franchise, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a flimsy, cynical retread of better material."
"Grassroots is a movie where bad ideas, because they're the ones championed by the ""correct"" side, are king. It never acknowledges that sometimes idealism is just another kind of manipulation."
There's not a single surprise or moment of dramatic tension.
Silver City is nowhere near Sayles at his best.
"A generic title for one of the most generic, forgettable biopics in recent memory. Even Depp's formidable charm cannot illuminate the utter dreariness of this flatline of film."
Not even Greenaway's obvious fascination for his protagonist can save this awful movie. [Full review in Spanish]
Its impact is muted by the dull foreground figures&#46;
"The type of sporadically silly and patently predictable horror pic that would look like filler on Syfy's weekend lineup, ""The Other Side of the Door"" brings virtually nothing new to the supernatural genre."
"Thinking back through the movie, I cannot recall a single thing either character said that was worth hearing in its own right, apart from the requirements of the plot."
The characters in Year of the Dog are far more interesting than the events they take part in. And the setup is better than the payoff.
"Builds very little momentum and fails to drum up a convincing bond between the men, making it difficult to take seriously."
"After a great set-up, we're left stranded by the side of the road, wishing the filmmakers had come up with a conclusion at least somewhere close to as good."
Surprise! Jake Gyllenhaal is a viable action hero after all. Now all he needs is a decent action movie to star in.
"Aside from its best-supporting accolades, Charlie's Angels does little to advance the series."
"... Proceedings trundle chaotically along until the whole thing comes to a sputtering close, as if all involved just decided to call it quits and hit the nearest bar."
Not as smurfing bad as you might have thought.
It's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic Oliver Parker intends to mangle next time.
The title is almost as long as the movie.
Most of it is rehash&#44; and smug rehash at that&#46;
"These tulips may be photogenic, but they are doomed by root rot."
"Possibly it reinforces our awareness that finding any sort of path through life is a pretty overwhelming business, but this is not a terribly radical conclusion."
"It is entertaining and its protagonists are very inspired in their roles, but it lacks something that defines it as an individual entity beyond its female cast. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Happy, Happy is another gust of smugly cold air from the land of Bent Hamer."
Dillon doesn't yet possess the directorial chops to give his story the necessary snap; the action too often feels poky and muffled.
Vanessa Redgrave and the spectacular locales of Tuscany are the main reasons to tolerate the tepid and predictable story...
Florence Pugh is great&#44; and Wilde proves she&apos;s got a great eye behind the camera&#46; However&#44; the story and themes fall apart in the 3rd act&#46;
Your enjoyment of all this will probably depend heavily on your willingness to let the words romp and Taliban coexist for approximately two hours.
"""Green Lantern"" is bad."
"...if you're not smiling during the opening moments of Sam Raimi's Oz the Great and Powerful, you've got no soul. If you're still smiling by the time the movie's over, you've got no discernment."
"The so-so ""Chernobyl Diaries"" feels like the sort of horror movie that ""Paranormal Activity"" was meant to replace."
"It aims for comfort food, but ends up with leftovers."
"The film oughta be Reeves' story -- except the filmmakers, like everyone else, couldn't figure out how the poor guy really died."
"Like so many women who unwisely spend too much time in gyms ruining their looks under the delusion of self-improvement, [Hunter's] muscles upstage her femininity. But the girl can still act."
"A stunningly incompetent family adventure film that fails on all levels of art, intelligence and even basic technical proficiency."
The makers of Post Grad managed to squander a promising and timely concept -- relative scarcity in the job market -- by turning in a screaming dud of a comedy.
"No less than in the glossy caper's 2013 predecessor, the plot rides a surging tide of ridiculousness and culminates in a pileup of unconvincing explanations."
It's sad to see a great director burn out.
Apparently it's hard to be a grownup in today's crazy world without committing consequence-free statutory rape. Ugh.
Everyone involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves.
"It's bogged down by too many derailing tangents, but the three appealing leads have a wonderful chemistry, and it gets close to the spirit of the season."
"Misery, misery, misery."
"The Rock, as if bidding for another appearance at the Republican National Convention, stars in this parable of neo-con justice."
"Not an outright disaster by any means, but neither is this seasonal horror picture anything to get excited about."
"A ludicrously convoluted, laughably hard-boiled heist movie that inspires incredulity rather than affection."
The story lacks the historical sweep of Persepolis... this often plays like a bummed-out Amelie.
"...gets almost everything wrong, from resisting ""Best Friend's"" resistance to a too neat 'happily ever after' wrap to ickily lewd comedy over the romantic variety."
a complete waste of time
"""The Single Moms Club"" is almost good."
Watching an emasculated member of the ruling class get cuckolded by a proletariat whets one's appetite for seeing the master-slave dialectic played out with more vigor on a less private and pastoral stage. Why not in Russian and at even greater length?
It is one thing to want to create a cubist perspective with cuts that demonstrate the passage of time and the dimensions of space; another is that in a cut a character is in a position and is interrupted by another image. [Full Review in Spanish]
The bravery of the real soldiers is buried under a mountain of hokey sentiment and rah-rah bluster.
The story offers nothing original.
"Despite Sergi and Alex's mutual vow that their separation will change nothing, this is an indie drama. These two are doomed. That sense of inevitability comes more from knowing genre convention than it does from anything about the actual characters"
Be ready to be intrigued by a bunch of kids then bored and confused by a conclusion that somehow took two hours to get to.
If only the film achieved the same heights as its two killer protagonists.
"As my son says, 'The books were a lot better.'"
"[No Time to Die attempts] to ""modernize"" the James Bond character by stripping him of traits deemed problematic while also clinging steadfastly (and often embarrassingly) to the series' most meaningless of traditions."
"The movie fails, I'm convinced, because it approaches the problem philosophically instead of psychologically."
"Watching Bad Company is like taking an express train to a familiar destination -- there's little to do but stare off into space, waiting for the dull ride to end."
"With her well-meaning desire to create an inspirational story of survival and redemption, Holmes has kept the entire film extremely low-stakes."
"Fun? Quite tiresome, actually."
The glaring opportunism of the enterprise discourages an apologia of any kind
"The wafer-thin, hastily-baked American Pie 2 just doesn't measure up to the original."
"Winter Solstice is the kind of ambling, event-free family drama that will either draw audiences in with its gentle, understated power or quietly bore them out of their skulls."
The outcome could not be more Nordic. [Full review in Spanish]
A laughter vacuum whose race to parody the likes of Mama and the new Evil Dead remake didn't stretch to writing actual jokes.
It's all terribly self-referential.
Of course something has to change. But let's start with the eco-doc format.
"Any picture featuring a sped-up version of the ""William Tell Overture"" is so drunk on its own whimsy that it most likely sucks with a dedicated vigour."
"From the very start [ilmmaker Sebastián Lelio] stacks the deck in favor of Weisz's secularized character, and as a result the Orthodox community becomes little more than the backdrop for a simple lesson about following your heart."
"The 2022 crop is somewhat disappointing, and predictably dour."
The point of things quickly shifts from engaging the audience's interest and/or intellect to merely keeping it stimulated and guessing.
"Sadly, mother-to-be-on-killing-spree Prevenge doesn't live up to expectations."
"Estevez probably could have cut the cast in half and come up with a richer, stronger film."
Given Fawcett's trailblazing achievements -- and Gray's choice to film in difficult circumstances deep in the Colombian jungle -- the film is oddly restrained.
Not so much a terrible movie as an unnecessary one...a sense of redundancy plagues the movie.
Those who agree with its sentiments likely felt that way going into the movie. And the film is so talk-heavy and strident that it becomes overwhelming and a bit of a bore.
"It's all head, no heart, which is generally the opposite of those formative years."
"Sadly, it's a crazy amalgam of subpar storytelling, non-stop action and constantly swirling camera work. Motion sickness ahoy!"
"The movie is delightfully odd but not consistently inspired, often straining to rewrite the rules of superhero cinema, a mixture of good and bad ideas all mashed together."
"There's a hint of the psychopathy of The Comfort of Strangers or Blue Velvet as these dead souls play Peeping Tom with the living embodiments of their past, but Jolie Pitt is clearly aiming more for the spirit of Bergman, Buñuel or Antonioni."
This is an exhilarating musical -- but it's dragged into Thumbs Down territory by a dreadful story that creaks along between the rousing gospel numbers.
"The more this musical tried to look relevant, the more dated it felt."
"Michael Bay has once again transformed garbage into something resembling a film, at least in the loosest sense: it can be run through a projector and used to sell millions of tickets."
"More funny than frightening, and not enough of that either."
"...could have been a fantastic, 80-minute B movie - it certainly has the appropriately shlocky special effects - if it weren't directed by Frank 'Stephen King' Darabont."
Could someone please turn down Denzel Washington's Righteousness Meter? It's set too high.
"A ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative, of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking."
"It's beautifully shot and skillfully acted, but My Sister's Keeper, an earnest family-faces-cancer drama, is a bit like a real-world horror film with 'heart,' right down to the trick ending."
"Tries to be a drama about mental health, a missing-person mystery and a twee romantic comedy at the same time. It succeeds at none of it."
"This film experiences large amounts of drag. A who's who of Hollywood in supporting roles...and fine, vintage production design, however, avoid it being a total plane wreck."
"While the scenes with the little prince and the aviator are whimsically charming, they fail to make up for the framing plot's trivialization of the source material, undermining the original story's beguiling, tragic quality."
"a supremely schizophrenic movie, alternating awkward scenes of bad comedy with gruesome and unsettling moments of violence that reach a nasty level of documentary realism"
"The road trip movie may be a film festival staple, but Boundaries could be proof that this subgenre has run out of gas."
The sad truth is it&apos;s too dull to be offensive&#46;
"What's arrived at the other side of this troubled production history is a work that's all spirit, no soul."
The computer-generated settings have a Photoshop feel; you can almost hear the mouse clicks.
"A gleefully nihilistic, abysmally messy romp that delights in upending the genre's conventions and tries desperately to, like, totally blow your mind with its outre freak show."
"At the end, there is a payoff of sorts for the viewer."
"The overwrought Irishman resembles an American kabuki play about sin that also relishes sin. It epitomizes the degradation of ""where we are today."""
"A movie whose visuals are lovely to behold and lyrically awash in sensuality and desire, but sets the lives of women back at least a few centuries."
"...a slightly amateurish and tatty look to many of the edges here, which director Howden attempts to disguise with reams of humdrum flash and cybernetic nonsense..."
"It's not scary, it's just surprising and surprise is not the same thing as horror."
Dark Phoenix is as sloppy as Mystique's makeup
"Well, the gloves are off this time around, for no matter how many different ways you look at it, former Saturday Night Live funnyman Will Ferrell's Christmas comedy Elf is a big lump of Yule tide coal."
"After spending 45 of the movie's 95 minutes in an orgy of consumerism, The Guitar suddenly speeds up its tempo and begins bombarding us with plot developments."
"A strained, relentless quest for gross-out humor and outlandish sexual escapades."
It leans into too many melodramatic tropes. 
http://www.totalfilm.com/cinema_reviews/films_out_this_week/fools_gold
"Moments of actual horror are rare, however, because the director never does much to build cat-and-mouse tension."
"Girls, let's have another Cosmpolitan and remember the past fondly. But make way for Chelsea [Handler]. She drinks vodka neat. She's a real woman."
"The movie belongs to the fifth-billed Bishil, a truly gutsy young actress who captures the essence of young female desire in all its adolescent confusion."
"By allowing himself to be talked into doing this Harris has diluted and sullied his most storied creating, robbing Lecter of much of his power to fill our dreams with dread and our nightmares with bloodcurdling screams of the shocking."
"A movie based on Charles Atlas ads would be both more realistic and more entertaining than the moist, dithering hackwork slinking into theaters under the moniker Joe Somebody."
"Though visually engaging, overall the film is a mixed bag of the strengths and weaknesses of the sci-fi world Lucas created."
"Before I Go to Sleep leaves you longing for short term memory loss to wipe away the 90 minutes spent watching an R-rated clunker that's a violent, brutal, and illogical mess."
East of Eden deals with inner conflict; the entire story could be played out in a living room. Instead it sprawls all over the eye-filling landscape and the real action is padded ...
"Like Secretariat himself, the film is a glossy, big-hearted slow- starter, but lacks his ability to power home ahead of the competition."
"I'm tempted to borrow one of Mrs. Henderson's lines and call the film a ""frivolous distraction"" except a ""frivolous Oscar bid"" is more like it."
"The comedy is never all that funny, and some scenes fall noticeably flat, either because the cast isn't strong enough, or because the production as a whole lacks polish."
"As stupendously staged as the gore-drenched violence may be, this new Texas Chainsaw Massacre still turned my stomach for all the wrong reasons."
"The film's problems do not lie with its cast, further evidence that Matt Damon is one of our very best actors, a charismatic Everyman. Nolfi cannot modulate the tone of his film, but he could get Damon elected to public office."
"Incoherent, creatively bankrupt and excessive to the point of tedium, Michael Bay's farewell to the Transformers franchise is a deafening mess that will disappoint and enrage all but the most loyal of fans."
"At over two hours, Valerian will initially have you feeling starry-eyed but it won't be long until you are left spaced out."
Glass has talent and sensitivity&#44; but a lot of potential drama in the material just slips through her fingers&#46;
"Fourth entry in the Halloween horror series is a no-frills, workmanlike picture."
"There are plenty of 'inspirational' speeches and cloying montages, but no real depth or drama. It's also a tad offensive in its handling of the subject of euthanasia and, um, let's be honest, some of the dialogue is unintentionally hilarious."
"The laughs dry up even as the gross-out material grows more, uh, fluid."
"George Clooney's ambitious misfire is well intended, but curiously cold and uninvolving. There's an inherent problem here, one which could have offered up an artistic challenge, but somehow, Clooney just doesn't meet it."
"The first big film of 2013 has the potential to be its most disappointing, with Gangster Squad a major fumble for director Ruben Fleischer who wastes an all-star cast and sure fire premise."
[S]urely the worst thing James Cameron has dared waft his fortune close to.
"There is simply no joy in The Last Jedi. But all great legacies, I guess, are destined to fade."
"This feature, spun off from the PBS series, will provide preschoolers with comfort and amusement, though not rapture or enchantment."
"There is an interminable chase scene near the end, leaving Ford teetering on a girl's bicycle and Harnett driving a weeping mother and children."
"Fast-paced, yet frustrating chronicle of the downfall of a promising politician."
It's lovely to look at but director Ben Wheatley's take on the classic Daphne du Maurier tale is bland and beige.
"A joyless, misanthropic 105 minutes worth of ""comedy"" that rates as Coen brothers at their worst. How one can take such a marvelous period and turn it into a voyage into hell is an imponderable mystery to this critic."
Cusack didn't miss much.
Nothing in the film rings remotely true.
Trimming 20 to 30 minutes of material not involving the Chairman would have considerably tightened the romantic angle and strengthened the entire film.
This nothingness doesn't even have the good grace to be a bad movie. The low-point of every single career involved.
Una is a character and a story that fails to engage and the argument for its existence as a film is a sadly unsuccessful one.
"As a horror fan, this high-minded Talk Radio of the Living Dead left me as cold as a Pontypool winter."
"The third in the Twilight series of films may be the best so far, but I still wonder if this series will ever amount to anything besides box office gold."
"If there was ever any doubt that action scenes depend more on context than flash, Fantastic Four proves it."
Logical lapses trip up Jake Gyllenhaal's rescue drama.
"Why Whoopi took up the habit here is a mystery-unless she's tired of this part and wants to make sure there won't be any more ""Sister Acts."""
"Without Remorse is a convoluted thriller that's far too scenically modest for its supposedly wide canvas, and way too shortsighted to maximize its Black lead character."
"It's the lack of any serious intent that means too much of it is desperately unamusing, and unamusingly desperate."
Polls since 'JFK' show a rise in the number of people who attribute Kennedy's assassination to conspiracy; will polls in the wake of 'WTC' show a bump in the percentage of Americans who connect Iraq with 9/11 (even though the film doesn't make the link)?
"The filmmakers seem curiously at sea over the purpose of their assignment, possessing neither the patience to plunge headlong into the story's familiar depths nor the radicalism to reinvent it entirely."
"The actual result is sad, pathetic, anxious, and depressing."
"Produced under the Scott Free banner (Ridley and Tony Scott, producers), it's surprising that such Hollywood heavyweights would choose a script that's so woefully bare."
"An unpleasant exercise about the pointless, dehumanization of war, as well as the pointlessness of sex and perhaps even the pointlessness of existence itself."
An okay rental. Didn't even come close to living up to its potential.
"By adding spurious action and making the characters older than in the novel, the makers of The Giver sell-out the story; a project which prizes individuality shouldn't so slavishly adhere to the Divergent-school of teenage drama."
Drooling fans of the game franchise mightn't be too happy at this complex and depressing extension of its mythology -- and they won't be the only ones.
“Sophomore slump” fails to encompass the badness of Don’t Worry Darling. “Sophomore cratering” or perhaps “sophomore pratfall” get closer to the mark. 
"As filtered through the drug-bombed haze of Jesus Franco, this mixture of vampires and sun-drenched Riviera setting is nonsense from the get-go, but if you like a little soft gore with your soft core, this is the movie for you."
"Overall this is a remarkably unremarkable film, lacking in subtlety and enshrouded in that depressing sense of Catholic guilt which Gibson no doubt wrestles with every night."
"Unless you've got something new to bring to the highway, keep your stories at home away from classic cars and jokes about cancer and pedophilia. You're better off staying in and watching your own dysfunctional family squabble and act petty."
An often-funny movie that has two dumb ideas for every good one.
Dear Diary: Mia's return engagement is anything but engaging.
"Robert Pattinson and his stomach cramps - I mean, aching unrequited love - are less oppressive, but the trade off is Taylor Lautner and his relentless shirtlessness."
"The tears and laughter are genuine enough, but Berstein's orchestrations make her less of a fly on the wall than a fly in the ointment."
Buried deep inside this misbegotten comedy is the glimmer of an idea.
"Although Pet Sematary is not the genre's best, it's a solid film. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Check your calendar, and then cross out Halloween--at least for this year."
"With its cotton-field locations, diddley-bo props and scripted nods toward blues history and mythology, 'Honeydripper' somehow feels touristy rather than authentic -- as if it were a product of research rather than passion."
"Leigh and Cumming are somewhat disgruntled members of the Hollywood scene who have not deeply worked out a critique. The film lacks sufficient anger at the current state of affairs and, more generally, a strong purposefulness."
"An at-best-mediocre comedy with a few more laughs than the limp 2012 film..like so much contemporary comedy, isn't really about anything, except its own meta-ness."
"A dreadfully earnest but fatally uninspired effort to compress the aftermath of an epic catastrophe, massive nuclear war, into a small-scale family memoir."
"So eager to be firm that it goes totally soft, like a hard-boiled egg left in the pot too long."
"As far as topicality goes, The Night Listener's account of authorial deception certainly benefits from its parallels to the recent outing of JT Leroy as a fraud."
"It's clearly not to be taken too seriously, but the ever-growing levels of nastiness are, at times, no chuckling matter."
This lighthearted yet undercooked caper is a pale imitation of vintage Agatha Christie&#44; but not without its mildly clever twists and subversive intrigue&#46;
"Pet Sematary still isn't very scary, but it's gotten a lot more stupid."
"Years ago, The Cave would have made an adequate bottom half of double bills. But at today's ticket prices, this is a wait-for-cable movie if there ever was one."
Certainly the meanest-spirited film ever associated with the Disney hallmark.
"I didn't enjoy watching it, but it had its validity."
"The Clapper is a comedy that doesn't totally know what it wants to be, a commentary on fame and class or a romantic comedy. What we end up with is something that never really does both well and ends up hampering each theme."
"Heck, I could sit through a movie a whole lot worse than this one just to see a pair of my favorite actors banter back and forth."
"If Chuck Berry were dead, he'd be spinning in his grave."
"Let's hope ""The Brothers Grimsby"" is a career anomaly for Cohen, who's wasting years on garbage, showing real desperation for the first time. He doesn't wear it well."
"Had director John R. Leonetti the slightest interest in the inner lives of teenage girls (i.e., at least half the film's characters), Wish Upon wouldn't so often mistake ""light"" for ""silly."""
The underwhelming drama contains echoes of so many other indie flicks that anything original is all but drowned out.
A disappointingly flat affair.
"Everything is spelled out, so much so that it completely kills any tension that could have been built."
If parts of the film can be effective&#44; they are undone by a gleeful desire to depict cruelty&#44; juxtaposed with borderline hilarious plot holes&#46;
"No, Ethan Hawke can't do Shakespeare."
A frivolous and superficial tale. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Been there, undead that."
Straight viewing could result in brain damage.
"You could say that PG-13-rated horror movies are, well, ""Cursed."""
"The leads embody their characters despite creative shortcomings, and could hold up a strong Justice League if the franchise is given some new directorial talent..."
"I suppose you could say ""Despicable Me 3"" is a victim of the precedent set by the other films in the franchise, as this movie isn't really bad as much as it is disappointing."
... I see no originality in See No Evil.
As bland and boring a tale of Washington skullduggery as the third-party candidate it posits as shaking up a presidential race&#46;
A film that contains some big laughs here and there but which is finally brought down by the inescapable fact that it is neither as smart as it thinks it is nor as dumb.
"If you never read Tolstoy, this film guarantees you will not be tempted."
"The film's deliberately overblown cartoonishness and its gleefully pandering adolescent cruelty never blend into the enjoyable style of, say, a good spaghetti western (Rodriguez's acknowledged model), or even a bad Quentin Tarantino movie."
Cross's plot doesn't so much thicken as coagulate into nonsense. 
"Fleshing out one of Disney's quintessential villains is an intriguing idea. But, while ""Maleficent"" teases at the premise's potential, it never quite sustains the magic."
"A perfect storm of mediocre writing, poor directing and acting so bland, that sitting through the film's 137 minutes is its own act of survival."
The story of AA Milne and the creation of Winnie The Pooh should warm the heart and bring a tear to the eye but there are only fleeting moments when it hits the mark.
"The magic, humor, and chemistry is missing between Hemsworth and Thompson confirming that three sequels are too many."
Harrelson doesn't have enough character to ground himself in this one.
"No better or worse than its video game-derived predecessors, hack-for-hire Russell Mulcahy's tired schlockfest blatantly rips off other, infinitely better sci-fi chillers."
"""Justice League"" is a one-step-forwards-two-steps-back affair"
"A film to see on sundays. Great performance, common story. [Full review in Spanish]"
"For the most part, Ruskin proceeds in a prosaic fashion that tends to drag. What feels like a dutiful approach to storytelling often robs the movie of opportunities to sizzle."
Who needs clever dialogue when you can watch Leo DiCaprio groaning and grunting for a considerable part of the movie?
The result is just as empty as those civilian platitudes that the characters repeatedly mock.
"Sparkle follows a music-industry hopeful getting her shine on, but there's a more interesting movie percolating along the edges of the frame."
"For better or worse this is no longer J.R.R. Tolkien's Hobbit it has become Peter Jackson's Hobbit. Lots of talking, walking and singing. Hard to take the villains seriously when they all sound like high-pitched singing versions of Elmer Fudd."
"To be fair, I'd certainly agree to a Ron Howard movie about my life. So, I certainly don't begrudge Vance for this movie existing. But I certainly wouldn't expect anyone to find it interesting."
A much better film in theory than in practice.
... character gets sacrificed for just another true-crime drama.
"Faced with a choice of blunt instruments with which to beat a good book into a bad movie, director Billy Bob Thornton chooses heavy, random, arty imagery and a leaden pace."
"There's an irrelevance to the movie that the filmmakers, hard as they try, can't quite shake -- something awfully square about the picture: It would have played a lot better a decade ago."
"If a misanthrope goes to a movie, then walks out and is glad to be among people because the filmmaker's world is so much uglier than the misanthrope's own, has the filmmaker accomplished something?"
Admirable as meticulously constructed piece of theater using real-life figures like billiard balls than for its emotional catharsis or insight into the evolution of a man.
"Since ""Scooby-Doo"" stoops to such bottom-of-the-barrel laughs I have no qualms about using a few childish words to bash this infantile attempt at creating a live-action update of a classic cartoon. Scooby-Doo is poo."
The film's lack of originality goes beyond its title as it tediously imitates fixed-camera observational indie dramas while privileging dialogue that plays like uninspired improvisation.
"But despite a budget that most likely surpasses the gross domestic product of a few small countries, the film fails at its most fundamental aim: namely to be scary."
Someone should tell director Kevin Bray that Miami Vice has been cancelled.
P.T. Anderson's most uninspired work to date and mostly a worthless waste of time.
"At long last, the Dead series may be ready for that final bullet between the eyes."
Offended yet? More like bored.
So no one would argue that Thumbsucker sucks. But the thing does seem just so indie-movie familiar.
"You suspect that Kephart & Company could not make a real horror movie, so they have no right to mess around with the form."
"In spite of Josh Brolin's heroic efforts, W. is a skin-deep biopic that revels in its antic shallowness."
"Gives the word ""forgettable"" a bad name."
A beloved artist unwinds with a parade of women and the needle.
"A film that's well-acted but tastefully restrained to a fault, with gentle humor about aging and a central mystery that isn't all that engaging."
The movie is an embarrassment -- another example of Hollywood excess overwhelming and sinking an otherwise unassuming story.

An example of middle-of-the-road insignificance.
"Remember David Helfgott, the concert pianist who goes mad in Shine? Imagine him in dreadlocks and as the star of a detective thriller, and you have a better understanding of The Caveman's Valentine than the people who made it."
disjointed and disappointing

We're left feeling disappointed that an opportunity to make a fine film was lost.
Sometimes silly comedies actually have something to say. Fist Fight is not one of them.
"TRON: Legacy is beautiful but cold, more machine than man."

It never captured my fancy or had much depth.
Christian-themed horror film too intense for kids.
A shoo-in to clean up at the next Razzie Awards.

"Doesn't quite deliver the comedy goods, but it plays well in spurts and, thanks to Ferrell, remains slightly off-kilter."
"Everyone connected with this gangsta opus was probably trying to make a crowd-pleaser. However, you wind up wondering what kind of crowds they were trying to please."
"American Underdog becomes scarily ecstatic, religious in its fervor for the manufactured thrills of a professional sport many believe has lost sight of its original core values."

Cheesy but not quite campy - the movie is stuck in the awkward middle ground between legitimacy and nonsense.
Pare away the lesser-effective horror elements from the film and what emerges is a gut-wrenching story of how isolating it is to live with mental illness.
What holds back Secret in Their Eyes is its excuse for added plot. It all feels like pandering to the current thing that scares people in the country.
"Delicate animation and a charming score may be why this Belgian film earned an Oscar nomination. Its story, however, makes no sense whatsoever."
"It tries for depth while holding your hand and glossing its surface; in the end, you get what you'd expect, which is a decent Holocaust-related drama, and not much more."
"We may not have seen the end of this nascent franchise, but the beginning leaves depressingly little hope for improvement."
"Boy fights an epidemic in dark, scary animated tale."
"If the whole thing flags, then dive-bombs at the midway point, it's not because Farrell and Schumacher aren't trying hard, but because the filmmakers struggle to wedge in some meaning where none belongs."

The new Carrie offers no fresh insights into the material and delivers far less than what De Palma achieved both thematically and cinematically&#46;
"As a character, Lolo is a conceit of indulgent parenting and never fully blooms."
"Enduring Love begins with such a stunningly macabre opening scene, it's a drag that the sequence is mere set-up for a ho-hum stalker story."
"Extinction has an interesting spin on the zombies themselves and does a good job of featuring two very different ways to live out the zombie apocalypse, but ultimately adds little life to the subgenre."
"While I've seen worse movies than Vampires Suck this year, I doubt I'll see another as lazily constructed -- even a homemade YouTube video capturing a dog chasing its own tail displays more effort and imagination than what passes for entertainment here."
"Doesn't reach the hilarious heights that its short film predecessor Peluca does. It's funny in places, but not satisfying...wait to rent it."

A typical run-and-chase Bay-a-thon before morphing into a Polyphonic Spree video at the very end.
There's more dramatic meat in an episode of The Outer Limits.
As we have come to learn -- as many times as we have fingers to count on -- Jason is a killer who doesn't know the meaning of the word 'quit.' The filmmakers might want to look it up.
"Yet another silly Disney comedy that is strictly for kids... if you don't mind your kids being exposed to the vulgar material that passes for humor in ""family movies"" these days."
"Burton's update is never tedious, but it's his safest creation yet. It lacks the eccentricity, visual flair and heart that make his films so uniquely his own."
"There's an overall sense of incompleteness to a narrative which can't quite deliver on the moody, self-reflexiveness it promises."
"You'd never know from License to Wed that Krasinski is a big asset to The Office. Here, playing an unappealing male lead, he merely smugs his way through the assignment."
Afghans in this movie are for the most part either barbaric or stupid... sometimes both.

Chan Is Missing proves to be a better pretext for a movie than a finished film.
"Gods of Egypt is a completely misguided spectacle that suffers from poor storytelling, laughable effects, and a confused tone."
"In its efforts to please those nerds, Hollywood may actually be selling them short with films that have little of the ingenuity that used to be the lifeblood of genre moviemaking."
"""Lila & Eve"" never disappoints when it's intimate and raw, but this dramatic pursuit eventually bores the production."
The most I can say is that it made me want to take a vacation to Santa Barbara.
There was too much Richard Curtis and not enough Danny Boyle in this case. I didn't feel like it was a melding of their voices that went particularly well.
"Armored has a decent second half but the use of obvious metaphors, cliches and amateur film making knocks the film down to a satisfactory rental."
"Family-oriented fantasy, paranoia thriller, midlife-crisis drama... It's as if the screenwriters felt obligated to throw in a few ingredients for every possible audience..."
"No better or worse than indifferent, although its targeting of the German capital for fratboy profiteering suggests some renegotiation of the Marshall Plan may now be necessary."
"Delivery Man is desperately trying to retrace the same route as its predecessor, but even with the same road map and driver, this big-budget meat wagon never reaches the same destination."
It's like the last spark of a flame that went out years ago. [Full review in Spanish]
"The anemically kooky coal-in-the-stocking comedy feebly employs the same tactics. The toothless slapstick Fred Claus is merely ""ho ho ho"" and a bottle of dumb!"
"How can you make fun of such self-aware subjects as Borat or Johnny Depp's winkingly fey Jack Sparrow? Who hasn't already noticed Tom Hanks' bad Da Vinci Code hair? And really, is there anything left to say about Samuel L. Jackson and those snakes?"
This overly long reading from the Rowling scriptures [is] a certain recipe for slumber.
"Long, tedious and not much fun at all. The ending is good though."
"The entire exercise is about 'fun,' of course, but Marshall and Co. are so intent on shoving it down our throats that the first instinct is to rebel and be grouchy."
"For all its faults however, this is a romantic comedy that works - if just barely."
2019&apos;s feel good movie&#46; With some of Desplat&apos;s magic in the score and impressive acting&#46; But the movie feels too much &quot;in your face&quot; and has a weird story structure&#46; In a year of incredible movies&#44; this is pretty forgettable&#46; &#91;Full review in Spanish&#93;
"Unlike the domestic spy thriller of the 1970s, today's CIA apologist thriller does not reveal how official truth is an illusion, an elaborate cover-up constructed to hide abuses of power."
The story meanders weakly around the main plot and is only reined in by Bardem's strong and cunning performance.
The result is the indulgent treatment of an overindulgent character that feels more Penthouse Forum fantasy than morality tale. Perhaps that's precisely the point.
"There's a lusty depravity in play here, and a wild verve informs the film, but it's not particularly coherent, and after time the sloppiness of the technique wears you down more than the little perks of audacity manage to lift you."
"If you're sitting through this flick searching for the two or three mild chuckles, you're in for an experience akin to that old ""needle in a haystack"" scenario."
"40 Days and 40 Nights is raunchy, and graphic, and sometimes even funny, but its attitude makes it a difficult film to enjoy."
It all comes together in a satisfyingly preposterous finale. It even dares to leave a deliberate loose end. Shame it leaves so many in the middle.
"A half-decent, half-trite, mostly mediocre bowl of mushy strained baby food."
"Force of Nature is supposed to take place during a hurricane, but the movie itself is another kind of disaster."
Thriller cops Hitchcock idea but stays mostly prone.

Director Alejandro Agresti badly miscalculates the appeal of his young star.
"The film is depressing for some of the right reasons, and all of the wrong ones."
It's not as clever as either the exceptional [Inside Llewyn Davis] or the very good [A Serious Man].
"[S]poradically satisfying... If this tale of rags to riches to major felonies has a familiar feel to it, it's that it feels Scorsese-lite..."
"This modern-day, teen-centric take on W. W. Jacobs' classic horror story The Monkey's Paw is a not-scary dud that suffers from both uninspired scares ad extremely shallow, annoying characters."
"The plot here didn't work for me, but I really adore this cast and I think this director will make something great."
"Zeffirelli's slight 'what if...?' tale reduces the diva to a petulant drama queen d'un certain age throwing herself a world-class pity party, hardly an introduction likely to convert unbelievers to the cult of Callas."
"... a jargon-filled documentary less interested in culture and history than mechanics, machinery and the rush of speed."
The film lowers the spiritual/Buddhist/new age bar and suffers from a cold and distant tone chosen by an almost unrecognizable Kiyoshi Kurosawa. [Full review in Spanish]
"It won't make anyone forget Miracle on 34th Street, but this is pleasant fare as far as holiday films go nowadays, which isn't very far."
"There's a lot of motion in this motion picture, but not much movie. Video gamers may find it enough; adventure film fans may long for more."
Broyles and Haggis redundantly hammer home the same point in scene after scene...while fail[ing] in 132 minutes fully to breathe life into their triad of reluctant heroes.
"While there's much to admire, there's very little that could be considered entertaining to someone not already enamored of geisha culture and lore."
"For those of us not so enthralled with Ms. Roberts, you'll have to endure the movie, but will be mildly entertained with good, old music and some stellar comedy provided almost entirely by Rupert Everett."
Worse than the crude humor is the movie's forced sentiment.
This film fails so miserably don't be surprised to find yourself often rooting against the supposed good guy.
When Dominion isn&#8217;t suffocating itself with world-building&#44; much of it frustratingly untapped&#44; it&#8217;s wholly given over to corny fan service&#46;
"There's a bit of ""Slap Shot"" and a bit of ""Dodgeball"" in ""Goon,"" although it isn't as sharp as either of those films."
Audiences who like to see bullets rip through eyeballs and cheeks will undoubtedly be delighted.
It's a movie that makes you wonder if Hollywood even remembers how to make comedies anymore.
This interminable piece of crap copped a big prize at the 2009 Copenhagen International Documentary Film Festival.
"Eventually gains the sense of warning that should accompany such a morality tale but for far too long indulges in cheap, unmotivated exploitation."
"A powerful tale, but one that's done in so old-fashioned, heavy-handed a fashion that it already seems dated."
"Irrelevant, never-funny references to everything from Juno to American Gladiators"
Director Icar Bollan mixes Even the Rain's various storytelling modes with an obviousness that ultimately negates enlightening intellectual or emotional discovery.
"The problem with the film is the juxtaposition of the plantation & the contemporary era, which leaves more questions than answers, and hard-to-connect-with clunky mechanics."
I was invested in the characters but never fearful for them.
Inherent Vice is half-baked Raymond Chandler. With too much emphasis on the baked part.
Basically all the elements of this film are of a completely zero quality. They do not exist. [Full Review in Spanish]

"I lost my trust for this film. I don't want to be mad at a documentary I agree with, but I don't know who this is for."
"Sprints past ""unfunny,"" is still going strong when it reaches ""disaster"" and easily reaches ""cautionary tale."""
"This Broadway mainstay is horrifying -- nightmare-inducing, really."
Sometimes Clint Eastwood does this. Forgets how to make a movie.
There&#8217;s a fun premise here that is unfortunately hampered by the lack of much visual imagination to elevate the material above sitcom-level plotting and stakes&#46;
"Following two excellent entries, this third prequel sets out to deliver a grandiose adventure with a cataclysmic dramatic reckoning, but mostly falls flat."
Max Rose has the superficiality of a student film inexplicably bursting with famous people in it.
"The movie blithely repeats most of the clichés of the American badass-cop flick, only in impenetrable Cockney."
...this is a superb cast that knows how to put the right spin on clever dialogue - even when they're playing thinly drawn characters in a dated and unnecessary story.
"There isn't enough energy to the direction to hide the fact that there is really no plot, just some loosely strung-together of individual events."
"Becomes laugh-out-loud awful, with dreadful, lame lines delivered painfully badly -- as if a different screenwriter and director had taken over for the movie's final act."
Almost all the scares that connect have been imported from the original.
About as entertaining as watching paint dry.
"We sense Howard the Duck II struggling to emerge, perhaps holding the flaccid trunk of Murray's elephant bomb Larger Than Life."

"The movie is all over the place, jumping around in time, place and tone."
Last Blood is an exercise in excessively gory violence and dubious political action moviemaking that adds little of value to the Rambo property.
"[STephen Frears] seems to have run out of ideas, despite Dench's riveting turn as Queen Victoria, Empress of India."
"Despite great performances and a boastful production design, the film is bloated with enough story for two movies. Because of this, the movie alienates itself from being fully involving."
Jenkins and Hedlund do great work here but it's the unnecessary supporting characters who undermine what could've been a strong drama.
"Witless, crude and deeply disappointing."
"Privileged audiences that swooned for Decline of the American Empire should expect more of the same oh-so-witty jibber-jabber and specious political ""noise"" exchanged between Arcand's motley intellectuals."
"[T]he film works so hard to explain its plot developments that it scarcely has any time left over to dramatize them. Exposition has not merely vanquished mimesis, it has burned its homes to the ground and sown salt in its fields."
A film that showcases a potential talent but fails to do so in the best possible Manor.
"The film descends into a monster-movie malaise starring a horde of balding CGI monsters that look like refugees from a video game and that will scare absolutely no one, save those who worry that green-screening is ruining the movies."
A hell of a ride? No way. Crude and vulgar? Fine. But unfunny? Inexcusable.
Shyamalan's least satisfying post-Sixth Sense effort.
"If you've got a script full of fatuous repartee and an inept director (who was banned from the ""Bourne"" sequel), you're not going to have an entertainment worth diddlysquat."
"It was a decent concept (at best) that was not supported with a good screenplay, and grew sillier by the minute. It just didn't work."
A homogenous and formulaic attempt in continuing the exploits of master spy kids Carmen (Alexa Vega) and Juni (Daryl Sabara) Cortez.
Never have I seen reality come crashing down in a film in a more literal--and disappointing--way.
"A more bone-chilling experience is trying to solve the mystery of whether Arquette, Gabriel Byrne, as the Vatican priest trying to save her, and Nia Long, as the best friend on stand-by, needed to be in a hit this badly."
"There were things that offered promise... but one after the other, they blended into the blandness of the storytelling."
"Moore's version looks sharper and plays classier than the first film, but still hides the same old silly fright mask underneath."
"Too polished to be truly creepy, The Return has more than enough atmosphere to keep you watching - but nowhere near enough mystery."

There's simply not enough for Maggie and David to do to sustain an entire movie.
Hollywood Ending is the most disappointing Woody Allen movie ever. He has a great cast and a great idea. But the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work.
"It's typical of the film to set up a major sequence in which flying monsters Mothra and Rodan dog-fight, only to cut that short and follow Mark as he struggles to open some airplane doors."
The film is elegantly composed and offers the occasional fright but its minimalism is as calculated as its story is annoyingly familiar.
"Renner, also a producer of the movie, makes the fatal mistake of rendering a complicated figure a simple warrior for facts."
"There's probably a point to be made, but the film lacks the confidence to make it."
"Monaghan and Foxx, for all their gifts, can't transcend the material, though they do get more out of it than most others would be able to."
Kajillionaire is unconvential coming of age story that becomes weighed down with its quirky schemes.
"Even if Wanderlust is a bust, Rudd and Aniston will walk away from it with no repercussions as they both perform very well."
"For an idea of the level of wit, several gags are built around the name 'Dick Banger'."
"Despite all the sad twists and turns in the central love story, the movie's most heartbreaking element is that Hurt and Bello do such good work in a fairly negligible movie."
"Craig Johnson, coming to this project from his indie success The Skeleton Twins, can't find the heart in this fractured, disappointed family."
...a road-trip movie that never leaves its writer-director- producer-editor- star's bloated head.
Bambi is . . . MALE?!

Sheer hell.
Derbez tries his best to prop up an inoffensive yet ineffective detour through comedic contrivances&#46; 
It all comes across as rather contrived.
"Lacking a single moment its director hasn't already done before and better, it feels like the flabby greatest hits medley from an over-the-hill pop star's oldies circuit tour."
It is the first film of his career that feels incompetent and utterly gratuitous at times.
"The Club's unfolding is a marvel of carefully calibrated suspense, heightened by stark music from Arvo Pärt. But its final third is so burdened by metaphor and gruesome plot contrivance, viewers can be forgiven for wanting an early exit."

"So how does a filmmaker bounce back from an almost universally reviled action-horror mistake? Well, if your name is Uwe Boll, you don't."

"The performances are fine, as one would expect with this cast, but the writing and sadly the directing in ""Transcendence"" lacked the vision or coherence necessary to make such a high-concept film fly."
Australian director-actor John Polson commits a belly flop in the troubled waters of creativity with his new teenybopper psychological thriller Swimfan...manufactures some otherwise pedestrian thrills and chills.

"A melancholy and, in places, excruciatingly slow take on the tale with virtually all the comedic moments pared away."
"""Once Upon A Time"" takes this opportunity and mostly squanders it, reframing the murders as a story about white male heroism that does a disservice both to Tate and to the story Tarantino was ostensibly trying to explore."
"Visually splendid, but anyone demanding more from a film than endless battles against overwhelming odds, fought by fellows who scamper through tree tops, is in for a letdown."
Here's hoping Green's next film is just 90 minutes of Ray Wise talking to an imaginary friend.
"Barbara Albert's contemptuous Free Radicals unravels like an Austrian Short Cuts, except there's no humanity buried beneath the life-is-bleak passages of the film."
"""Hitchcock"" is an amusing lark, but the clumsy way it dissects the director is for the birds."
"Gibney's inspiration was the outpouring of public grief for Jobs upon his death in 2011, a phenomenon that clearly got his dander up and which prompts him to begin this work with a simple question, 'Why?' That question is never answered..."
A collection of sketches does not add up to a drama in this case
"Though it's jumped on the 3D bandwagon, the fourth Shrek is almost surprisingly clunky and old."
"Dramatically inert and oddly unaffecting, A Call to Spy does a disservice to the incredible women that it wants to honour"
A corporate crime drama that runs fatally amok.
"A dim, cruddy collage of Dark Ages, sub-Conan the Barbarian mush. Talk about trashing an awesome bedtime story -- there aren't even any 'Knights who say nee!'"

You'll be wishing you'd gotten your satanic-flick fix by staying home and renting The Omen.
"There are sweeping helicopter shots and chic cinematography but this three-hander isn't cinema: it's a Ted talk shot in a boutique hotel, with ideas about consciousness and evolution itemised rather than dramatised."
"The ""action"" scenes come across as brief, noisy periods of rest from the lame comedy, which counts for something, if not quite what the filmmakers intended."
"A weary, half-hearted affair that doesn't even have the courage of its own nihilism."
How can the author of this piece of shit be the same guy who wrote Seven Men From Now and Comanche Station?
It's just such a shame Swinging Safari is so shambolic and nowhere near as funny as it thinks it is
"Watson has come a long way from her cartoonishly broad performances in the early Harry Potter films, but still feels a bit stiff as Lena."

"It's not just stupid, it's offensive."
"This #MeToo era spin-off has a glamorous New York setting, a high fashion backdrop and celeb cameos aplenty, but little of the pizzazz and film-making brio necessary to make the formula really work."
"We are offered a handful of sketchy observations on the extent to which art either does or does not mimic life. These are, at best, unchallenging, and would have drawn barks of laughter from the derisive Flaubert."

"Do they make it home? You will have to wait for very, very long to find out."

"The Eagle fails to soar, thanks largely to Kevin Macdonald's unimaginative direction and Channing Tatum's charisma-challenged performance."

"While it succeeds in aping the superficial aspects of [Martin] Scorsese's style, ""Joker"" lacks the intelligence or gravitas of Scorsese's best work."
"The whole thing plays like a fancy dress parody of a crime movie, except nobody seems to be having much fun."
"'In the Name of My Daughter"" is one of those French films that leave you going ""huh?"""

"""Constantine"" isn't heavenly. But it's an interesting enough look at what lies beyond."

"Not very likely to seize that Potter market, this is a disappointing film that starts out okay but goes rapidly downhill, thanks to rudimentary characterisation and storytelling that's designed more to accommodate gratuitous action."
"You're left with a ""Charlie's Angels"" that doesn't know what to make of itself and, for the first time, feels out-of-style."
"Independence Day was once the enjoyable kind of junk food, but Resurgence is the kind that leaves you walking out in a slack-jawed stupor, wondering why you ever got excited about it in the first place."

"The formidable lineage, alas, doesn't make for a compelling work."
"In it, Ian McKellan (winner of 6 Laurence Olivier Awards, a Tony, a Golden Globe, a SAG Award, 4 Drama Desks, and 2 Critics' Choice Awards, a two-time Oscar and four-time BAFTA nominee) says the words 'meow, meow', while licking the back of his hand."
"Sad sequel to a surprisingly clever dark comedy. The voodoo curse is pointless, and all the funny death moments were used up in teh first one."
One: why does Pooh sound like an old man? Two: why does teenager Christopher Robin sound like a six-year-old? Three: what's with the rubbish songs?
"It's bad enough that it's amateurish, but does it have to be boring too?"
"The filmmakers thought that the combined star power of Pitt and Jolie rendered inessential the need for a coherent narrative, basic structure and an actual resolution."

About as deep as an empty wading pool.
"An unimaginative, paint-by-numbers film that avoids originality like a stampeding ostrich and reminds audiences that this is merely a re-run of The Dwayne and Kevin Show."
"Spiral is a good faith effort at expanding the Saw cinematic universe...Unfortunately, the realization of that expansion isn't quite up to snuff."
A bummer clearly.
"It's ironic that the producers enlisted Harlin specifically to up the movie's fright quotient, because the finished product contains zero scares. Laughs, on the other hand, are abundant."
"It's on the easygoing level of Surf's Up, and a full tick up from, say, Over the Hedge or The Ant Bully. But given the Seinfeld pedigree it's something of a disappointment."
Creed II frustrated me&#46; I thought it&apos;d be about the guy with everything &amp; a big moment of self-awareness&#46; But instead it makes excuses for success-fueled aggression&#44; lack of perspective&#44; &amp; an inability to find the best way to make a right out of a wrong&#46; 
Even really fine actors like Annette Benning and Ed Harris can't do much with this ludicrous doppelganger story.
"There is a serious functional problem running throughout in that some of the dialogue is conducted in Spanish with English subtitles, and some is conducted in English, even when Bolivians are talking to each other. How weird is that? Don't bother."
"In My Boss's Daughter, there is no gee-whiz factor, only one Herculean whiz. A pox on this scatological scourge, I say. Let us all together put down the seat and flee for our sanities."
"It's unfortunate that, nudity and all, this is one of Toback's absolute worst efforts."
At a certain point the movie is grounded by its director's grave approach.

"The film as a whole is amateurish and ungainly, can't find a consistent tone, is too long, is overladen with music that tries to paraphrase the story and is photographed with too many beauty shots that slow the progress."

"I am about to issue a declaration that amounts to blasphemy among many film critics, fashionistas and women of a certain age: I am so over Diane Keaton."
"The characters aren't real enough to grab us, and without that, we're too aware of the well-trod path they're on to be engrossed."
"Many movies about killer aquatic creatures on the loose have succeeded due to a lightweight, carefree mood or an ironic tone; Shark Night has none of this."
"[Gille Klabin] manages to rope in a breathtaking audio-visual representation of drug paranoia and dreamscape, but when it comes to complimenting it with a script that doesn't just try to be smarter than it actually is, he falters."
"Beautiful to look at and acted with full and tempestuous conviction, it still seems to be taking place in an apartment far across the way."
"In re-enacting the actual events surrounding the storied 1836 battle, this oppressively solemn historical-action movie is both elegiac and trivial."
"Guns guns guns, blah blah blah... Gibson's character in Jean-Farançois Richet's Blood Father may fit him like a glove, but the glove is ugly and old-fashioned, unsuited for these times."
"What could have been an engaging, maybe even enlightening story about the unfairly high price a woman pays for conducting herself like a man winds up as nothing more than a worthless, harmless and ultimately charmless piffle."
The kind of Boston movie you'd expect from a couple of Lakers fans.
"It's a good thing the action is noisily distracting, because you don't want any down-time in which to ponder the plausibility, or the sense, of anything that is happening."
"Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul is painfully awful, hampered by a charmless cast and a criminally lightweight screenplay. A long haul indeed."
Bare-bones X-Men facsimile combines all the worst elements of recent young adult fantasy franchises.
"From the animation to the plot to the characterizations, Space Chimps is second-rate goods, and that's only if you're being kind."

"If a suicide attempt is too personal for the filmmaker to try to intervene, what right do we have to just sit back and watch?"
To stay invested in the dulldrum vigilantism of Hannibal Rising requires siding with a psychopath.
"A film like this could feel like a home run if it just delivered the bare minimum in an efficient and entertaining manner, but the finished product can't even clear that low bar."
"You wouldn't be surprised to see Mr. Eubank directing a bigger-budget movie down the road, but this film demonstrates some blanks in his approach that still need to be filled in."
It's pretty poor.
"Most of it plays out as sub-medium-grade farce, but Carrey has some funny calisthenic bits where he appears to have the pliability of a rubber toy."

A grandly staged but soulless and mediocre retelling of Moses liberating the slaves of Egypt.
"Faltering vanity production that's riddled with trite cliches and utterly, profoundly predictable."
"Pratt and Lawrence shine, but chemistry alone can't carry Passengers."
"The problem with G is not merely that the ending doesn't work and feels hopelessly contrived. It's also that the plot adds too many unnecessary characters and subplots, so that the main line gets misplaced."
... who thought raw sex could be so boring?
Plays more like a bloated final hour of a better movie than an actually satisfying experience on its own terms.
"For all the assuredness behind the camera and in front of it, there's very little in way of edge or even, surprisingly, emotion."
"Though time is taken to establish all the town characters and their relationships, everything is laid out so blatantly that it's not so much development as boredom. "

As feeble as a teen comedy can get.
There's no doubt director/writer Apatow is supplying a national service by allowing the inept to feel adequate about themselves.
"The air almost immediately starts leaking out of the film once it starts. The whole first half-hour is a riot of blunt exposition, useless flashbacks, and false starts. This is a movie that doesn't even know how to begin."
[Danny] Strong makes Salinger's triumph Hollywood-simplistic.
"Everyone involved takes this tat seriously except William Hurt, who goes gung-ho as the alter-ego goading Brooks' kill frenzies. If only they'd cut out the middle-Kev and cast Hurt instead..."

"Georgia Rule is not just a bad movie, it's a creepy one."
"The Front Runner isn't morally penetrating, like Chappaquiddick, nor is it as offensive as Truth, the 60 Minutes scam biopic in 2014, but it still ends up as liberal Hollywood mush."
a one-joke film - and the joke is in the title.

The climax devolves tremendously - not just quickly but also extremely bumpily - to the point that the intriguing setup will surely be forgotten.

"Cukor ... directs with all the panache of an unwanted contractual obligation. Indeed, Marilyn disliked the script but accepted Let's Make Love to fulfill her Fox contract."
Cry_Wolf is not_scary.
"A soft-centered pastoral drama that' stretches a suspension of disbelief beyond the breaking point and is never as tough-minded as you want it to be. Still, in these pandemic times, it's no crime to indulge in the cinematic equivalent of comfort food."
"There's probably a pretty decent 90-minute film somewhere in this needlessly sparse, sledgehammer-subtle dramedy."
"Gibson is a credible, attractive hero, as he has always been, so if you want fast-food action, here's your movie."

"Bahrani fills the frame with weathered faces and ""At Any Price"" feels like it unfolds in something close to the real America. But he wants to give us larger-than-life drama, and his strengths are life-sized."
"For all the posturing that sexually politicized Americans use to praise the French and their liberating attitudes towards funtime, why is it that their most sexually charged films do their best to sicken rather than explore or educate?"
"Nat Turner's is a story that deserves to be told, but Nate Parker's admirably-graphic telling is light on insight and motivations."
"The new Annie is jam-packed with Glee-style choreography and greed-is-good luxury. Like its predecessors, it's a fantasy. But unlike them, it's not so much heartwarming as warmed-over."
"Just about everyone falls into a black hole of overwritten, overwrought melodrama in this convoluted disaster."

"""Taken 2"" is nothing more than a naked cash grab."
[A] flaky disaster.
Morally bankrupt. And this is coming from someone who thinks Ted Bundy was misunderstood.
"Save for Hiddleston's too-brief supporting turn, this is mighty forgettable stuff, a by-the-numbers sequel to what was already the slightest and least entertaining of the 'Avengers' components."
"Mostly, Guilty of Romance seems content allowing characters to verbally abuse each other before eventually reaching the inevitable conclusion that life is a burden and all love is illusory."
Sarah Paulson's great performance and one or two genuinely funny scenes cannot wash out the sour taste of entitlement and the sentimental contentment with the mediocrity laurels that Blue Jay proudly rests on.
"The movie's conception of the tender agonies and embarrassments of would-be teenage lovers is hobbled by punchline cuts and predictable musical montages (carefree dashes, setting off bottle rockets, etc.)."
Weak graphic-novel imitator.

"The romantic tale becomes redundant, with scripter Krueger struggling for inspiration -- and viewers quickly losing interest in her idiosyncratic protagonist."
The end result plays like a Fast & Furious film for BAFTA voters.
A creepy little diversion that ultimately unravels long before its hero's fragile psyche does.
"Fasten your seat belts, folks. It's going to be a cliche-cluttered ride."
An intriguing setup in search of a compelling narrative...

A stock bodice-ripper - albeit one in which all bodices survive intact.
"Affleck is just fine when he plays a regular guy, but whenever he tries to, like, act, he ends up looking like a perplexed and mildly retarded simian."
It is an interesting premise for a horror. It is a weird idea for an inspirational story.
"Yes, 4Ever is harmless in the extreme and it'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes, but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to Spirited Away?"
"The screen adaptation itself is meant to pay tribute to classic stars and the art of filmmaking, but ""Zeroville"" is a eulogy to what could have been. While cinema is a beautiful thing, the book's adaptation is a sad reminder of a fickle industry."

I was more bored and fed up than frightened.
"The Promise finds Oscar Isaac lending his soulful, heartthrob magnetism to material that fails to achieve the timeless, old-fashioned feel to which it aspires."

The Transporter films are pure garbage; ones that don't quite reach the bottom of the chute since the XXX flicks will cushion their fall.
"The screenplay is weak, the humor is lame, the action is this smorgasbord of dizzying darkness and poor CGI. The Predator rips the spinal column out of this franchise and chooses stupidity and redundancy over an actual evolution."
"If Snow White's tale is a shiny red apple, then modern tropes of fantasy are the poison."
"A Woody Allen devotee, writer-director Maria Maggenti hawks an insular view of New York City where poverty doesn't exist to illuminate the grotesque solipsism of her characters."

A movie that begins with high tension gradually fizzles out.
Keir Pearson's script plays out like a highlight reel of the grape strike. It fails to effectively dramatize the slow process of converting ordinary laborers to the workers' cause and of selling the boycott to everyday consumers.
"Like most horror spinoff sequels, Annabelle: Creation is a silly, cheap attempt to cash in on a gimmick."
How dense is Binder? He uses an acoustic version of Our Lips Are Sealed to underscore a tender moment Jack recalls from his childhood. Because nothing says 1976 quite like an iconic song from 1981.
I've never seen such a bad film so well made.
"While Crialese ... certainly has a knack for visualizing such moments, his script willfully refuses to pull them together to tell a coherent story."

"Please, never again."
A hit-and-miss curio.
Villeneuve tries hard with Dune to create a remarkable universe but fails to make it a place we'd want to be and to create characters with whom we'd want to engage.
[It] doesn't sample an outdated clichéd aesthetic; it is that outdated clichéd aesthetic. This is a $100 million Golan-Globus movie-an incoherent cartoon full of slop and jank drowning out the brief sparks of charm thrown by actors who deserve better.
"It's an interminable farrago of slogans and pyrotechnics. It has the scathing exaggeration of satire, without the point and bite which make us recognise the real world. It flies off into its own realm of sadistic fantasy."
The use and abuse of flashback works as a kind of glue to inefficiently gather the gigantic plot gaps. [Full Review in Spanish]

This comic book adaptation is likely to flame out fast.
"Jones displays some acting chops, but the character she creates with Wong has all the personality of a museum tour guide."
"The film covers no new ground, offers no new concepts. and introduces almost nothing fresh in the way of storytelling or character development. Rudd and Reed made a solid duo in the past, but this time around the formula stands out more than the charm."

The performers nearly sabotage the effort.
"This adaptation lurches too abruptly from set piece to set piece to make the basics clear, and between the occasional bursts of wonder, I found the film too dark and uninviting to command my full attention."
The movie never quite decides if it wants to be a sensitive drama of self-actualization or a playful party movie and ultimately misses the mark on both counts.
A film of high gloss and low substance.
"The initial wit is replaced by youthful high jinks, animated interludes and some incredibly convoluted plotting. A shame really because for the first half hour this looked like comedy gold."
"There's little to suggest it was worth exhuming the decrepit shell of the franchise back for another round. If this is enlightenment, pass me another blue pill."
"The best drug addition movies are usually depressing but rewarding. Quitting, however, manages just to be depressing, as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance."

"Despite an occasional moving moment,...this cinematic dirge fails to achieve the degree of profundity it's obviously aiming for."
"Any similarity between the characters, persons, institutions or events in this movie and those, living or dead, in Sex and the City is purely coincidental because the folks who made this movie couldn't pull it off no matter how hard they try."
"Funhouse has a clever idea, but this is the kind of movie that continually comes up just a bit short in every area."
I.T. is a film to turn off - and never turn back on again.

"For a movie that aims to make four artists' last spotlit hurrah a revel-worthy moment, Quartet shouldn't urge the viewer to welcome the closing of the curtain."
"The film, directed jerkily by Walt Becker, hangs too much on the lovers-to-be and doesn't take full advantage of the screwball caricatures lurking in the wings."
"What worked in Shields's quiet, contemplative novel about a family in crisis falls flat on screen."
"In focusing on predominately kid-gloves portrayals of her teen players, Kimberly Peirce never properly addresses the machinery behind their doom, which is why the film is relentlessly lifeless when it's not literally ripping off De Palma shot-for-shot."
"Berri also remains a boringly uninteresting director, dotting every i and crossing every t with nothing much on his mind but platitude."
A flaccid thriller devoid of any sense of dread or fun.
Irrational Man is turgid to the point of ridiculousness and absurdly anachronistic ...
"Sydney Pollack has been a hit or miss director for 40 years. Unfortunately, The Interpreter is one of his misses."
"If the film is smarter and more ambitious than I expected, it is also less involving: a meandering, digressive plea for a social conscience that never finds a rhythm or a pulse."
Very silly.
"It doesn't push any envelopes, and pushing envelopes is what it's all about."
"This trapped-in-a-house flick starts off well, with genuine suspense and strong characters, but it derails after a sudden turn, leaving its major theme disappointingly unexplored."
The dullest horror film to ever come from Universal.
"It may not be a great film, but it's better than a poke in the eye with a sword."
"Despite a cast stocked with comedy ringers, everyone flails about aimlessly, as if trying to get through the experience as quickly and painlessly as possible."
"Vapid, emotionally manipulative and irredeemable."
"All in all though, bogged down by familiar plot beats and comedy cliches, Double Tap seems destined to become one of those highly-anticipated but mediocre follow-ups that fails to leave a lasting impression."
Perhaps more problematic than the film's derivative nature -- with plot points and dialogue borrowing somewhat from Sex and the City and rather heavily from Woody Allen -- is the fact that the film is just not funny.
Only when it gets personal does The Armstrong Lie pick up speed.
"Yes, I realize this is a kids' movie, but that's no excuse for short-circuiting creativity."
One can't help but think that a movie chronicling Ayoub El Khazzani's journey toward that fateful day might be more interesting and useful.
There is no real tension in the film and can seem formulaic. [Full Review in Spanish]

"Like Alice, the film seems to be making itself up as it goes along, which would be fine with a less expository script than the one Marston wrote with Julian Sheppard, and with fewer showy gestures at the surreal."
"Sunny, good-natured yet inescapably middling ..."
Something got sooo totally lost in the translation from page to screen -- like humor and charm.
A contender for the worst movie of the year was released in April.
"The film features the same noxious mix of racial humor, sexual innuendo and violent slapstick as its predecessors. A racially insensitive gag revisiting Abbott and Costello's 'Who's on first?' routine is painful to watch."

"Looking at what it became, it is a deception. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The Wind could have been much better if editing and creative timelines took a step back, and allowed the harrowing story and stellar performances to be the focus of the terror. As it is, the film tries far too hard to tell a tale that needs no frills."
"As Kim, Maggie Grace is a bit old to convincingly portray a boppy underage teenager, although she appears to be giving her best to a one-dimensional role that essentially disappears during the movie's slam-bang midsection."
"There are a few moments of striking visuals along with Mauro Fiore's generic Vegas cinematography, but nothing that can't be done about as well in a video game."
Wall-E is Chaplinesque in the worst way.

...it's a much better film many times over than the 2000 version with Kirk Cameron...which is to say it's still a slightly below-average movie.
"Too often, the viewer isn't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance."
"The Look of Love stays on the surface, and since decadence no longer shocks or even titillates, that surface has lost its luster."

"[T]he real point, which has little to do with the movie's canine stars, is kind of lost with the dog-centric focus."
Presents a hollow shell of the Farrelly Brothers I know.
"(Gods and Generals) is as dry as a history lecture, as distant as the Peloponnesian War."
"Sometimes a movie pretends to be more than it is. In this case, it pretends to be good."

"If every year has a Showgirls, Saw is the prime candidate for 2004."
"Once again, it's as if the trappings of genre alone are somehow shameful and beneath Cooper, that he's more interested in tropes eLeVaTeD bY tRaUmA and boilerplate social commentary about poverty rather than really mining any meaning from them."
"It feels more like the pilot for a cable series than an actual movie. (In fact, the nicest thing you can say about Feast Of Love is there's a ton of nudity.)"
"Despite its charm, 'The Laundromat' runs the risk of being buried in the maelstrom and in the algorithmic contemporary audiovisual culture. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"A semi-effective, sometimes incomprehensible, out of its time, revenge picture in search of a drive-in theater that closed 30-odd years ago."
"Woody Harrelson's no-holds-barred performance as a veteran cop trapped in a downward spiral of his own making is the white-hot core of this intense drama, whose relentless intimacy may play better on a small screen."
Plays like the unhealthy spawn of Carrie and Heathers.
People of Earth! Rejoice! The Justice League is here to save the day. Listen. Do you hear that? It's the sound of one hand clapping.
Marilyn Hotchkiss... is a bit device driven as it flashes back and forth from Frank's lonely life to the accident that will change him forever
"This could have been a gritty, realistic drama but the writers have gone with a safer, more commercial option. The unsatisfying ending is proof of that."
"With every recycled piece of business -- which is to say, every scene in Anything Else -- the distance widens between Allen and the elusive audience he pessimistically chases."
"As a writer, first-time director Andrea Berloff has a track record for solid, if unremarkable, adaptations and gritty true-life tales. Her take on the comic is, unfortunately, just clunky."
It's the Bernie Goetz of Vietnam movies.
WAAAHHHHHHH!!!
Gained international acclaim for Anthony Quinn in a role many believe he was born to play and one that he's become best-remembered for.
"An intense, harrowing drama betrayed by a campy Rosamund Pike performance."
"After learning the explanation, you'll wish you never asked."
The hot-button issue of public school reform gets unsubtle treatment in this pedestrian and insultingly tendentious drama.
"Justice carries off this tear-jerker, mainly because she has to... Almost everybody else cast in it is ""adequate,"" and not much more."
"Avengers: Age of Ultron, is a letdown -- entertaining to a degree, but so overstuffed that it may mark the point of diminishing returns for the Marvel movies generally."
"Disappointing, poorly thought out animated comedy that fails to deliver any decent laughs and is further let down by a slapdash script, some blatant product placement and a miscast Woody Harrelson."
The cumbersome Finding Neverland never gets off the ground.
Barrel-bottom buddy-flick refuse.
"Certainly the Twilight film in which the most violence happens, which gives it the illusion of having the most incident."
"Mr. Barinholtz has enough cachet to assemble an excellent cast, although he's not as canny about using it."
... it's a bit of a shock to see this caliber of star power and big-budget production and location juice... yield such dismal results.
"There's none of the suspense or tension a good horror film should have. Slashing that trope was perhaps not the best survival strategy when resurrecting a franchise favourite. It's all guts and gory, but is disappointingly short on glory."
"Blomkamp loses his nerve with this one, slowly distancing himself from what actually works in the film."
"It's a tad unfortunate to see Aniston hamming it up to the high heavens, doing what she has been doing in rom-coms since, well, forever."
"It's too hurried, and its action sequences badly deteriorate as the movie goes on, rendering it a lackluster start to a potential franchise."
"Offering both too little material and too much, the movie leaves us in the bizarre position of understanding its subject no better by the end than we did at the beginning."
"Here's all you need to know: Clouseau now surfs the Internet under the e-mail handle ""Doctor Knockers,"" and has to take Viagra before getting comfy in the sack."
"This may, in fact, be an accurate portrayal, but it feels like a reduction, a trivialisation. Hoffman neuters the politics and panders to the worst impulses of the cast."
"This low-budget variation on the underdog sports saga conveys a heartfelt swagger, although it too often brushes aside its unique details in favor of a familiar coming-of-age trajectory."
"In short, watching actual white noise would be preferable to sitting through White Noise. Avoid like your life depended on it."
"However good your characters and however telling the social and ethical issues your raise, if you ain't got tension, you ain't got a thriller -- and it's in this department that The Company You Keep mostly fails to deliver."
An erotic drama desperately in need of a spark or the cinematic equivalent of a small little blue pill.
"This film rests uneasily between art and thriller, putting a huge burden on the actors, especially Julianne Moore, to convey the larger meaning of the story."
"Sam Shepard is a talented actor and writer, but his directorial debut is a disappointment."
One of the downsides of living in a free society is that every so often someone like Myles Berkowitz gets hold of a camera.
I haven't seen such meaningful insight into the nature of human cooperation since this morning's Sesame Street.
"The movie gets off to a great start with Theron captivating the screen with her presence. She disappears for long stretches in a bloated middle section that takes the air out of the balloon. The movie's strengths are the costumes, the makeup and..."
"The tonal problem of the second installment, which often resembled a drug-infested pulp thriller instead of a comedy, is also problematic here."
"Because I Said So's biggest sin is that it treats its characters like idiots, with Keaton's Daphne leading the charge. [She's] a woman who apparently makes her living by baking the occasional cake, most of which land on the sidewalk or in her face."
"Aside from the occasional inspired moment of Cage playing pinball or unloading rage on Ozzie Ostrich, there's not much to savor here. It's a neat idea that never takes off beyond the concept stage"
Ready Player One is the first Spielberg film I can remember that feels contemptuous.
To boldly go where no man has gone before is not for a property so culturally and economically exploitable.
It's numbingly cold and pointless.
"...a banal so-called ""thriller"" that's so minimal you'll nearly forget it's even there."
"For all the spellcasting, there's very little magic in this movie."
"Jean is such a monster, and John such a put-upon sweetheart, that Glassland offers little more than undiluted bathos for over an hour."
"Unfortunately, director Carl Franklin paces the film with a dirge-like rhythm. And its lengthiness is hardly mitigated by William Hurt's lackluster performance."
There's no sign of the writerly derring-do that is really essential to daisy-chain storytelling.
It's standard supernatural horror stuff.
[T]his [...] film by Randolph Kret mistakes the study of a particularly virulent set of symptoms for a diagnosis... Nuance is not something Mr. Kret has much use for.
" It’s a promising idea, but scriptwriters Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis (Ramis also directed) seem to have no idea what a “better” Bill Murray would look like... in short, [he becomes] more cynical and manipulative than ever."
The movie's supporting characters are barely worth notice.
"""Shot Caller"" effectively conveys the vise grip of Jacob's options, but that doesn't make it less ludicrous from scene to scene."
"Alas, not even Lindsay Lohan -- doing a cartoonish riff on her tabloid persona (is this even possible?) -- can bring this rotten egg to a boil."
"""Transformania"" feels locked into the routine rhythms of its plotting and makes one-note jokes out of its human incarnations. It even ends with a character shrugging."
This sort of thing might work as a desperation rental -- like if you've been injected with poison and must keep watching incredibly lame movies or die ...
The film collapses under the weight of stereotypes and a hackneyed concept.
So who really needs Logan Lucky? More to the point: Will they buy this in the South?
After the Sunset has the audacity to con audiences with a script seen a million times before.
"Beerfest is one sloppy comedy, but the lads of the comedy troupe Broken Lizard don't know when to say when in their pursuit of the idiotic laugh."
"Like its defector hero, Mao's Last Dancer is neither here nor there...determinedly dull, even in the flatly filmed ballet sequences."
"There isn't anything unexpected here; it's the usual clichés: women are nasty cows who blithely undercut each other for jobs, and men are largely irrelevant to the process. . ."
"To Live and Die in L.A. is undeniably very well made - from the performances to the more technical aspects - but the bottom line is, it's just not all that compelling."
Bullets fly&#44; cars explode&#44; and near-misses are plentiful&#44; but laughs are non-existent in the picture&#46;
From madcap to moronic.
"Weisman's punchless direction certainly doesn't help, nor do the stridently unfunny performances."
"The film's final hour is bogged down with deafening, inconsequential gunplay between characters it's impossible to care a jot about."
Such a meticulously wrought piece of hokum that it's both easy to admire and impossible to warm up to.
Cloverfield has most things I deplore about movies and a couple of things I admire.
"A somewhat satisfying, because of its uniqueness, but ultimately empty horror chiller."
Duvall missteps in trying to mesh suspense with a love story.
"The problems are firmly rooted in the moderately silly script, excessive potty humor, and a cringe-worthy climax that preaches the evils of neglecting your little ones."
"Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War -- an overstuffed sausage of summer entertainment -- is the Ocean's Thirteen of spandexed heroism, if you can imagine a version of that movie with two times as many Brad Pitts and no poker dealers."
The smug and idiotic comedy God&#8217;s Time is a waste of time in how it inexcusably bungles a simple but over-used slapstick concept of two friends on a wacky &apos;life or death&apos; mission&#46; 
"It is approximately just as loud, gross and stupid as its predecessor was, and you get to see Milla Jovovich's boobs. End of review."
"On the one hand,trying something new and the statement they want to make is laudable. However, the distanced style, hard grainy lighting and extremely lengthy rape sequences make Descent not only often unpalatable but also mostly just plain dull."
"The Connection plods along, unable to find its pace, stuck somewhere in the middle of the straightest line between the movie it madly wants to be, and the movie it just sort of is."
The aptly entitled Downhill is a lackluster effort that dilutes the organic impishness of gifted comic performers in both Louis Dreyfus and Ferrell...an uninspired piece of snowbound sludge.
"Tipping throws all sorts of tricks at the screen, most of which don't work."
"It invokes real world issues and flirts with real world crises, but it has nothing persuasive to say about any of it."
"""Most Wanted"" is a decent film that's mostly undone by a lack of anything truly concrete to grab on to."
Berg uses his skilful eye to engulf this film with his trademark excellence in action and violence but mostly just to distract from the nonsensical and incoherent script.
"Oscar winner Brie Larson stars in an artificial adaptation of journalist Jeanette Walls' devastating rough-childhood memoir. Instead of the book's cold, hard truths, the film peddles easy upllft. It's a damn shame."
The Main Event tells a dumb and boring story about boxing. [Full Review in Spanish]
ny picture featuring Geoffrey Rush channelling King Lear as the patriarch god Ra while flying about in a spaceship can't be all bad.
"A howling turkey is at least something to laugh at, and maybe even something to see. But ""Thor"" is an example of the programmed triumph of commercial calculation over imagination."
"As far as shameless excuses to rehash crowd-pleasing gags from the first film go, it doesn't particularly go about its duties cynically."
probably worked much better as a live production
"This is a movie that operates at two speeds: Somebody is either giving a fake-sounding, melodramatic speech or fighting in a fake-looking, melodramatic battle."
"Whatever [Haneke] intended to express winds up as an aimless, pointless waste of time and resources."
This overloaded soap opera is so obsessed with sadness that it becomes a turnoff.
A slick technical packaging by director Antoine Fuqua can't offset the lumbering plotting and patchwork quality of producer-star Gerard Butler's vehicle.
"The plot is boring, who-cares nonsense. I think it's just unbelievably weird, and not only because Cameron Diaz screws a car."
[The story's] logistical problems would be excusable if the romance at the center of the movie were remotely compelling or if the jokes were actually funny.
The floatingly bland plot is like a children’s story without the humour; a YA story without the emotional wound; an action thriller without the hard edge of real excitement.
"Directed by Karyn Kusama, it's a grim watch, which proves perversely compelling - up to a point."
"You, Me and Dupree has the feel of a film that could have gone in any number of directions, and perhaps at one time went in all of them."
This mishmash retread fails to find its own identity on any level and should head straight to cable TV where it belongs.
"Road to the Lemon Grove is a ragged, unpolished movie, scattershot in both its themes and its esthetic."
"Sadly, the movie is weakly paced and sinister only when Pamela coos oh-so-sympathetically in people's ears."
...a soon-to-be-forgotten movie that had a few very funny moments.
"Tidbits that would make the film interesting have been squandered. Instead, we get the standard-issue haunted-house fodder."
While Slow Burn does admittedly pick up towards the end - as the film morphs into a flat-out ripoff of The Usual Suspects - there's virtually nothing in the first hour that even comes close to holding the viewer's interest.
An inspired-by-a-true-story comedy that squanders its goodwill by suffocating everything it touches in folksy clichés.
"It's exciting but, there is very little depth or poignancy to the story and while the movie will probably appeal to the fans of the first film, there's not a lot of reason to believe it will convince the rest who are new to the happenings."
"Ultimately Hedge is déja vu all over again, a computer-generated work of wonder that could have come out last year, last month or two months from now, a film so reminiscent of other films it almost immediately dims in the memory."
Parental Content Review
Dreadful script and appalling performances.
"The final third seems all shot in a strange blue light that makes even the gorgeous Theron look consumptive, and is, in a nutshell, no fun at all. Aren't Fourth of July movies supposed to be fun? No fireworks this time, Will."
"Parades about with a self-seriousness at odds with a second-half dominated by veiny-faced, limb-contorting special effects and screaming, screaming, screaming."
"There's just so much you can do with lines like ""You're not alone, Eric, you're not alone"" and ""the president's about to make his address!"" before you get sucked into the vortex."
Princess Di deserves livelier revisionism.
"There's a smattering of bright spots throughout, but overall, Alexander is such a neutral and neutered family film that it leaves behind no singular identity."
It's enough to make those Grumpy Old Men movies seem like masterworks of grace and subtlety.
"It adheres to the Hollywood formula for horror remakes: Twice the gore, half the scares."
A film best avoided by teenage misfits of any stripe.
"Needless to say, the whole thing builds towards a big shoot-out, but none of the action is executed with any verve or style."
"Triumph of the human spirit to the Miramax, predictable in its crowd-pleasing, middlebrow vulgarity but with a few inventive, free-floating passages"
What this revival needs is a good kick in the pants. And that Ephron and friends lack the low cunning to deliver.
"They look like jobbing veteran actors picking up another payday in some routine cop filler, and Avnet's busily clueless direction offers them and the clunky writing little help. Pacino. De Niro. It's over."
"""Stranded"" stops at being merely seriously dull and trite, rather than tipping into train-wreck silliness."
Feels unsure of its own journey&#44; losing its personality in a sea of overt CGI and poorly-executed humour that&#44; sadly&#44; cheapens whatever genuine wit Jeff Loveness&#8216;s script manages to occasionally muster&#46;
"While slickly done, it is so patently absurd that a more appropriate reaction ought to be not disgust but a shaking of the head and a muttering of, 'Are you kidding?'"
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials takes about three minutes to figure out and then another one hundred and twenty-seven minutes to end.
"The sad part is that while any old hack could have directed Primary Colors about as well as Nichols did, the kinds of movies that only Mike Nichols' brains and sensibility could produce hardly ever get made anymore."
IMF is WTF.
The tagline says it all: 'They can't get there fast enough.'
It feels less like a coherent narrative than a series of vignettes in which the characters say improbably witty things and act in ways that aren't tethered to rational behavior. We sense them performing for the camera.
Seven Pounds is a profoundly irritating mystery about a profoundly silly man.
"...drops all kinds of ridiculous into the story line, all of which could have been forgiven if they weren't so blatantly swept under the rug..."
Too silly to take seriously and too dark to find funny.
"O filme mostra um grupo de pessoas atuando para conseguir alcanar um objetivo sem que nenhuma barreira os impea. E se no h conflito, qual  a motivao do espectador?"
"Some of this is spectacular, some beautiful. But isn't this lazy documentary-making? How about some insight, some perspective?"
The movie is so routine that you welcome offbeat things like an alien who makes incredibly high-pitched noises. It's the sort of thing that might jolt you out of your sleep.
"As a trailblazing figure, Ruth Bader Ginsburg deserves a knockout biopic about her life. Instead she gets... a serviceable, but by no means extraordinary origin story of a pre-Supreme Court RBG as she begins to shape her legacy."
Starts with some decent suspense before devolving into utter idiocy.
Pulling off this claustrophobic level of immersion requires better orchestration than Kempff's drawn-out buildup.
Perfect drive-in fare. Too bad there aren't more drive-ins.
"A nihilistic, narcissistic, knuckleheaded move about nihilistic, narcissistic knuckleheads, The Informers might have been an interesting exercise in satire, if it only had a sense of humor. Which it doesn't."
"No one associated with the film tries very hard, from cinematographer Peter Deming -- San Francisco has never looked so drab -- to composer Mark Isham, whose watery jazz score is meant to summon melancholy but merely relieves insomnia."
Tyler Perry's Netflix debut was filmed over just five days and it plays like a movie defined by that schedule more than anything else. It's a total mess.
Dolittle is an unmitigated disaster.
"Imagine if Star Wars was the cinematic adaptation of Bridget Jones's Diary, and that's as close as co-writer/director Shana Feste gets to the source material here."
"As obras de Stephen King já renderam alguns ótimos filmes, mas também muitos péssimos. Infelizmente, Riding the Bullet se encaixa nesta última categoria."
"The way to celebrate cinema is to make a good film, not to lecture about it in a bad one. "
[A]ny hopes one might have of the film exceeding the low expectations set by its unnecessarily punctuated title should be abandoned forthwith.
"""Refueled?"" No. Recycled? Yes. Totally."
"[These characters are] overloaded with assorted ... baggage. Throughout the movie, those characteristics seem more important to the filmmakers than the real story..."
...rather pedestrian...
"Setting an historical fact in opening subtitles...may prepare the audience for what many view as an anti-Semitic work, but it does not address the play's tonal disjointedness"
"You couldn't possibly find a more ""James Franco"" project, produced by and starring James Franco, than The Color of Time, even if you tried."
The material is pretty gratuitous.
Trolls World Tour might be a good at-home distraction...or not.
or such a broad man this is a very narrow portrait.
"You know those artsy European coming-of-age movies set during World War II, like Europa, Europa? This is kind of like that, except with a few more beheadings, and everyone in Europe speaking English."
"Aside from Gere's performance, there's really not much to see here."
Violent and ultimately uneven and unsatisfying.
"As Grasten strains to connect the unhappy lot to the Genovese myth, convincing drama flickers out of reach."
"Given the cast involved, [The Other Woman] is nothing short of a disappointment."
"The Neon Demon might get the blood pumping temporarily, but it doesn't have staying power."
"While I appreciated what it was trying to do, I wasn't wild about it."
"There is a lot of cool and fun stuff going on, and the music is phenomenal, but it's all too contrived, really repetitive and painfully muddled."
"This artificial dog seems even more artificial because of its human-like intelligence and human-like facial expressions and movements. If this movie is the best adaptation of the book extant, and I don't know if it is, it is disappointing."
"It's a noble experiment in pushing the limits of cinema, but Tykwer never achieves true profundity."
"Out of the Furnace works as a bleak character piece, but fails as a drama and thriller."
"Aspects of the original plot have been tweaked, but where it really matters, the Coens and Hoffman demonstrate a surprising lack of inspiration. It all feels so dated."
You're tempting fate when you name your movie Failure to Launch. Especially when your movie's as stubbornly earthbound as this one.
"The American movie industry desperately needs a clever mystery thriller, but the sophomoric, nauseating and increasingly preposterous Red Lights fails to rise to that call."
"There was a good energy to the depiction of movie-Woody's nocturnal odyssey, and a few funny bits, but it was constructed upon a set of standard, and frankly, stale, comic premises."
It's regrettable that director Costa-Gavras puts more of his storytelling energy into simplistic psychology and suspense-movie action than historical depth and philosophical insight.
"The problem is that, unlike Ali G, Borat, and Brno, Aladeen is less a force of nature than a scripted performance."
Inept Animal House knockoff.
"Where the Coen Brothers' film was darkly humorous, Yimou goes for a broad comedy that may not translate to American audiences (crossed eyes and buck teeth used for laughs, for example) and his pace seems draggy."
Scene after scene is either a music-video shoot or a dance scene shot like a music video. The result is a film that's all flashdance and no substance.
"Full of incoherent, spitting rage, ignorant, paranoid violence and a complete lack of internal logic."
"Fun With Dick & Jane offers the faintly depressing sight of Jim Carrey, like Dick Harper, doing whatever it takes to earn his supper."
"A few of the gags work, though many of the jokes that were not funny in the first film are trying again and failing again in the second."
Its adventure loses its charm when the cat and his gang often travel through the same easy terrain where the surprise of fairy tales is absent&#46; &#91;Full review in Spanish&#93;
"Yes, Percy faces his Charybdis, but...Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters not surprisingly feels more dutiful than creatively energized."
"It yanks at the heartstrings too much to qualify as an edgy comedy-drama, but it's far too bawdy to make it to the Hallmark Channel."
"If you're a fan of Smaug, or expect anything near closure on the dragon laboriously set-up to be the primary antagonist of this world, perhaps another moviegoing choice this holiday season will be more satisfying."
"As critical as the message is in ""Zero Days,"" Gibney is just going through the motions here, with this feature adhering closely to his formula, becoming more of a lecture than a warning siren."
"The movie feels like it abruptly ends, long after we've been worn out by it."
A good scary movie retells a creaky story in a manner that terrifies you afresh. All this has is Tyler trembling like a wet-lipped goldfish in a performance you could peg out to drip dry. Run away.
It's like The Godfather crammed into a sardine tin.
Never transcends into anything much.
"In summary, the new Dirty Dancing is disappointing and a bit all over the place. But its biggest sin is that it's bloated and boring."
SuDoku: The Movie.
[A] very indie indie which tries hard to be simultaneously winsome and rueful.
Factory-made romantic comedy without an ounce of creativity or a shred of unpredictability.
"Cedar Rapids can't decide if it wants to be an R-rated romp or much sweeter comedy-drama, and in the end, falls inadequately between the two."
"Mostly, though, this is a cookie-cutter drama."
A dud with zero Milk Dud appeal.
"The denouement strains credibility, relying on a character showing restraint when they've merrily pulled the trigger for the rest of the film."
"With a few exceptions thanks to The Flash and Aquaman, Justice League fails to surprise and delight - the action set pieces should be cooler and the humor funnier."
"The defining entrant in, and the nadir of, the disaster porn genre."
"With only occasionally awesome CGI, it's destined to thrive when it comes out on DVD."
"Quarts of shiny blood are splashed around and numerous moans and groans pepper the soundtrack, but astonishingly, the movie never manages to provoke so much as a shudder."
A slick yet pedestrian thriller.
"Annabelle drifts away from these potentially interesting elements into a more predictable collage of frights, demons and flickering lights, a grab bag of set pieces, red herrings and familiar occult tropes that never add up to much."
"""Skin"" is a movie with a tremendous lead performance from Jamie Bell, though not quite enough else to warrant a recommendation."
"Holy psychosexual issues, LaBute-Man!"
"A stomach-churning gore-a-thon pandering to viewers' basest appetites for violence, Saw III is a repellent piece of schlock that manages to disgust and bore you, often simultaneously."
"Augustine Frizzell's breathless feature should come with a heavy schmaltz warning, and piles on the melodrama mercilessly."
It ranges from awkward to excruciating.
"This soggy, uninspired entertainment seems to demonstrate that director Ben Younger, who did such a terrific job with the stock-swindle movie Boiler Room, doesn't have the chops for a comedy that's trying to be funny and perceptive."
"No one in the movie feels like a living, breathing individual..."
We're basically gawking at a commute.
With its colourful but two-dimensional cast and constant flashbacks alongside shock reveals&#44; this surprisingly talky film comes off as a salute to Guy Ritchie and Tarantino imitators&#44; only with a more flamboyant approach to murder&#46;
It's as if Van Dormael realised how thin his ideas were but still felt the need to pad the film out to an enervating two hours.
Hamer has created a tidy film about a fabulously messy man.
Writer&#47;director David O&#46; Russell&#46;&#46;&#46;appears to have lost his mojo&#44; his based-on-fact&#44; history-is-repeating-itself satire about fascism&#44; racism and anti-Semitism drowned in an overly plotted&#44; meandering tale cluttered with too many characters&#46;
Sinks embarrassing comedy to a new low.
Yakin's hackwork is so slickly manipulative and preachy it has the tone of a politician's TV commercial...
Repetitive&#44; unfocused&#44; poorly directed and only intermittently funny without going bonkers enough&#46; It makes Lake Placid look like a masterpiece&#46;
"Believe it or not, its most outstanding achievement was making me laugh without even trying to be funny."
"This premise is a hard sell, but with more dialogue and less extreme rage, Taylor could have found a better lane for his idea."
"When you find yourself focused more on the fact that Mara's character never ditches her high heels, even when running around a forest, it's a bad sign."
"A bloated, simplistic, cartoonishly violent film."
"Little sense of the band's import or power is ever communicated. Instead, Temple devotes the entire second hour of the film to Strummer's uninteresting post-Clash career."
"While the exact events of Rattlesnake might have made for a good short story or hour-long episode of TV, they wear thin when stretched out to feature length - even when said feature runs just under an hour and a half."
"Rather than capturing the profound excitement so many people felt during the 2008 campaign, it just seems to be patting itself on the back."
"A tender love story, a solid villain, a spaceship pulled by goats -- Taika Waititi has packed a lot into the latest addition to the MCU. Unfortunately, it's not enough."
This is nothing but an attempt to cash in on the success of Gettysburg.
We Have A Ghost is a forgettable and bland movie from a filmmaker and cast who deserved a lot more than this&#46;
Unfortunately the last hour really pulls it down with a story change that drags.
"An across-the-board disaster from one of my favorite directors, Milos Forman."
For all it aspires to say about the foolhardy nature of those seeking purpose in the west&#44; Butcher&#8217;s Crossing lacks the patience to follow through when it counts&#46;
A spectacle with no life. [Full Review in Spanish]
"If Nancy Meyers were injected with some late stage, ensemble-theme-movie Garry Marshall, the result would be something like ""Book Club."""
"A better title might have been Greed, Theft or Espionage. Or, to be brutally honest, Boredom."
"Two full hours is a lot of “Hallelujah,” admirable as that song is. And unless you’re a Cohen fanatic, you may find this film’s recap of his other life and career aspects treads ground still very familiar from other recent documentary portraits."
"Supporting players save ""Daddy's"" day in this pleasant, fitfully amusing family comedy which entertains despite an inconsistent script (Geoff Rodkey) and insipid direction"
Some comic properties should just be left on the page.
"It's refreshing, at least, to see a YA film that doesn't feel the need to hide behind a postapocalyptic conceit."
No amount of slick camera angles or foreboding Trevor Gureckis music can cover the fact that all that's remained is a grandiose idea with no coherent plot to support it.
"teen drama that may be feel-good, but lets itself down by merely going through the motions."
"It's an endurance test that might pass the sniff test in terms of the insufferable lightness of being a teenager, but stinks to high heaven in terms of watchability."
"Director Martin Weisz does an adequate job of maintaining the movie's tension and momentum, but the lack of compelling characters and the unusual level of nastiness makes this an arduous mission for all involved."
"It's not all cheap laughs, however. There's cheap sentiment, as well."
"Despite the shameless laughs, it's still a disappointment."
In the vacuum that is our movie world Unhinged can't fade into the background and so its flaws become all the more glaring.
"Forget the middle-aged fans it might irk. Don't today's kids deserve some trash of their own, instead of a tasteful substitution?"
"Unlike Dom's beloved Charger, whatever's under the hood has started to rust and sour. Its charm wearing away from too many turns around the same track."
"Melancholy in all the wrong ways, this is a mostly forgettable movie that only makes a strong impression when it's disturbing or saddening in a manner the film itself seem only dimly aware of."
"A tough film on every level, and each viewer will have their personal and private response; but von Trier's cinematic flourish is undeniable"
"Neither story comes alive, in large part because the film never stops moving long enough to let them."
I can't dismiss the ugliness behind many of its antics.
"Its murky settings, contemptuous plotting and charmless characters add up to a film in which nothing counts more than death, preferably a spectacularly fiery death."
Once destiny is introduced into the story it deflates any sense of suspense.
Watching this prepubescent variant on Splash is like being trapped in a live-action issue of Teen Beat for ninety minutes.
"Redford and Nolte playing off each other while using those archetypes is consistently amusing, even as the screenplay ... starts to feel like a long trek to nowhere special."
Resembles a Tony Scott movie without any of his intelligence and cinematic invention.
"The disappointing end result feels less than the sum of the talents involved, a weak script and thin high-concept plot only just held together by smart visual wizardry."
Predestination has so little confidence in its conceit that what we're left with feels like belligerent exposition.
"From almost any perspective—dramatic, cinematic, political or musical–this is a thoroughgoing wash-out. It has no sense of cinema."
"Despite its horror movie premise, the Twilight series has become an ADHD sedative."
"Seriously, I'm astonished that anybody would try to pass this movie off as artistically or socially meaningful in 2007."
Skims the surface of how divisive politics drives wedges between friends and family but tends to lean toward broad comedy to make its point rather than insight.
"It's competently made, well-acted and largely intelligent, so why isn't the spy thriller ""Our Kind of Traitor"" more rewarding?"
"Is any of it funny? Hart and Cube's deliveries certainly are, but skilled comedians can make people laugh without being all that funny, especially if there's a large audience involved."
The film reflects on the moment personal and professional politics became irrevocably intertwined without questioning what's really so harmful about it.
...draws you in with the promise of a mind-blowing payoff and instead offers nothing more than hysterical hooey.
Bearable but hardly riveting.
"Unfortunately, while Shadyac the person may have gone through a life-altering transformation, Shadyac the director hasn't improved much."
"Ironically, it’ll take a large amount of mind-altering, intelligence-deadening substances to make us laugh at any of these jokes... sub-Joe Dirt junk."
"Lapid, following his acclaimed 2014 hostage drama ""Policeman,"" clearly has a lot on his mind here. But he tells his overlong story in such a diffuse, at times elliptical way that his reach exceeds its grasp."
"There are three or four movies competing for attention within Changeling, and unfortunately for Clint Eastwood, they're all equally dreadful melodramatic drivel."
"It’s dutiful, steely-eyed and, alas, just a bit dull."
An inspirational movie that has little inspiration to call its own.
"The Eye loses its effectiveness because of its repetition. Even if it's a well made horror movie, it is pretty predictable."
"Admission doesn't just misfire, it flatlines."
Another mediocre remake of a Japanese horror film in which flashes of computer-generated ghosts are meant to compensate for lousy acting and a banal storyline.
A movie about miserable people making each other miserable...neither character gives us much reason to care who they are - or ever will be.
"The cast are such old salts that they can't help but raise smiles and even the odd belly laugh, but the film's sexual politics will leave many viewers queasier than a sailor in a force 10 gale."
"It's meant to be funny. It's not, or not particularly. It's meant to be cute. Maybe it is, but I hate cute. It's meant to be harmless fluff. It is. All of this isn't terribly interesting."
This version of The Addams Family is not nearly ooky or spooky enough.
"The biggest bombs of the blockbuster summer season open up in the second weekend of May. This weekend, that movie is The Great Gatsby, and you can hear the ka-boom all the way to Australia, Old Sport."
[Bay's] movies are trailers for themselves. Every scene is all climax and no foreplay. When it's all over you can't remember if you've been watching a movie or just a jumbo-sized coming attraction.
"The 355 is, at best, passable."
"The very definition of an easy target--and, in all fairness, it deserves every last bit of criticism."
You can feel how much fun it was for DeVito to direct this. But the movie's one-note broadness seems suited more to cable.
You either take everything with a heavy grain of salt or ready yourself for an eternity of half-baked emotional beats working beyond their limits to bide time before the next stunt&#46;
"What we assume might turn into a patriarchal power struggle never reaches a boil, making for an overly sentimental movie that misuses the outsize talents of its two big stars."
"The end result of this recipe -- cooked with very little conviction, but with a generous budget -- is one more chapter in a story that has been told before. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Found footage films are the bane of my existence. They reward lazy filmmakers and punish eternally optimistic movie audiences.
"This is among the most loathsome films of the year, something of a Hollywood facsimile of Tideland, only Terry Gilliam's gothic upchuck was not so dense as to make any pretense to reality."
Young buck Lerman never convinces; you feel that a sharp clip round the ear would put him in his place. And his romance with lady-in-waiting Gabriella Wild has all the fizz of damp gunpowder.
It has to keep reminding us how tragic it is.
"Another reason to see the original. In this disappointing remake, it's time that stands still."
"Emulating such classic thrillers as Blow-Up and The Conversation, Who Killed Cock Robin soon becomes entangled in a web of contrived mysteries and implausible coincidences."
It's a manqu of a rousing adventure tale and not the real thing. You're constantly aware of the gulf between how the movie wants to excite you and the halfhearted execution.
"As pleasing as The Prince & Me can be, director Martha Coolidge's film delivers nothing to advance the genre."
"Disney never showed, say, Goofy actually defecating on camera, but 'Open Season' does just that with Eliott. And an entire scene is built around Boog's having a b.m."
"As a TV episode, it would be unmemorable but OK. As a theatrical feature requiring paid admission and a two-hour time commitment, uh, not so much."
The sort of schematic slog that stirs more discussion about the cluelessness of the filmmakers than anything else
"Marc Forster is lost in Edwardian Neverland. The plot is not only cloddishly obvious but thinner than a stage scrim, and Barrie's 'genius' is scarcely explored."
"The Belko Experiment makes for a truly fascinating concept, but is dragged down by mundane execution that doesn't always engage the viewer."
Updated remake misses the mark
"Yes, she is."
"Dench lends emotional heft and nuance to her handful of scenes, but Red Joan is otherwise let down by leaden dialogue and one-note characters."
"This Smug, Shrill Disaster Movie Satire Is Just A Disaster."
"""6 Underground,"" a non-stop stunt reel with a few, admittedly impressive displays of your usual visual verve -- is just ""Fast & Furious"" crossed with an old Whitesnake music video, but with fewer functioning brain cells."
"The film ends as suddenly as a song with no real lessons learned, no definitive character progression and nothing of real consequence having taken place."
Chess! What is it good for? Perhaps a television documentary instead.
Man on the Moon seems awfully puny in terms of scope and impact.
I find the whole enterprise wearying and a little ridiculous.
An incoherent catalog of worn-out horror movie clichs with a story that makes no sense and goes nowhere.
"The movie is largely gimmicky melodrama lathered with cheap, feel-good sentimentality."
"Pretty awful, a bad faux video game movie that should have had its plug pulled."
"While rooting for the marine mammals (and wishing for more footage of them-and even of their animatronic incarnations), your heart will also go out to the cast, stuck even more pitiably in syrupy manufactured crises."
"""Kick-Ass"" isn't just broken by its flaws ... It's flawed to start with, a hypocritical mess whose attempts to swagger turn into clumsy stumbling and whose knowing wink blinds it to its own problems."
Fifty Shades of Grey only has one shade: tedious self-pity. The other 49 shades promised in the title are missing from the movie version of the infamous novel.
"It's hard to believe, but the horror spoof goes under despite this awesome cast."
"The transparently familiar issues -- abuse, unemployment, parental neglect, promiscuity -- are stapled onto characters who never seem credible."
"Grace Is Gone grabs on to a name, a war, and the metaphor-come-to-life of a theme park with rides going nowhere. And we, the people, are spun around and shaken for tears."
You'd probably be better off reading Catch 22 - even if it is for the fifth time . . .
"That title is off the mark. Here's a better one: ""Stupid."""
Reduced to the now classic series of outbursts of anger by Hero Fiennes-Tiffin [Full review in Spanish]
"Mild to an almost offensive degree, ""World War Z"" has a whole host of issues, but the most irresponsible of all is in turning a grand-scaled, epic story of an undead pandemic into such a benign experience."
Devika is sincere in her portrayal in a simplified narrative that does little more than follow the form of a school essay on the Indian warrior queen.
"[Rescue Dawn] offers its own vision of deprivation but doesn't linger long enough, even mid-jungle, to leave us in the kind of directionless trance that was conjured by Aguirre and Every Man for Himself."
"For all its stylistic energy, The Hulk remains curiously flat and uninvolving whenever the monster is offscreen."
"What, in 1951, was a scary Cold War-era warning about the misuse of atomic energy has now become a vague and infantile pro-green special-effects showcase (even the CGI is unimaginative and looks like a swirly, soft-focus nightmare) with one entire suspens"
"Whatever this is, it sure isn't cinema. There's no adaptation, no reconfiguration of the material from one medium to another."
"Even death row is presented as a citadel of nobility, with every police station and courtroom a moral vacuum, while the narrative overflows with cliches and gossamer-thin characterisation."
Most of the film is just Mr. Lawrence goofing around.
"By the time you get home from the multiplex, it will be as if the whole thing never happened."
Fun in places but unfulfilling as a whole.
An epic film that without its lead might have been better.
Potential is a terrible thing to waste.
"The deity on high who has sent Eli on his mission works in mysterious ways that become more mysterious, and more blood-soaked, as the flick drones on and on and on and on"
"There's no fire, and where their lines should ricochet with wit, they just spill forth, affably."
"The movie ultimately feels exhausting, raising issues it doesn't have the energy to address (about morality, the role of journalists, the public's right to know) and presenting a wide-eyed Rice as a lamb led to slaughter."
"A Hard Day works best when it doesn't try so hard. Unfortunately, that is not much of the time."
"There are some bursts of visceral body horror, a few solid laughs and some genuinely clever narrative turns, but generally, it's more a film to admire for its creative animation than the most interesting story overall."
"Comic-book fans will find it entertaining enough to stay afloat, non-fans will start drowning and the rest of us will be tired from treading water."
"Maybe there are worthy films buried in collections of spiritual homilies, but Peaceful Warrior is not one of them."
"The Detroit Red Wings' season begins Saturday. Why enrich Disney's coffers for a shameless piece of cinematic junk like Mystery, Alaska when you can see the real thing?"
Unoriginal and boring.
"Snatch is loathsome in an unusually cheeky way. It's as if someone decided that black comedy needed to be put to death, using an electric saw that laughs."
What might have been a pretty decent claustrophobic thriller turns into a Mr. Rogers moral lesson (be nice to the pizza delivery guy).
"No one wants to let Eddie and his partner watch their kids at first because they are men, and of course men are only good at tweaking their cars to shoot flames from the engine."
"There is just as much right going for the film as there is wrong and, sadly, Ode to Passion falls short of being something special."
"As far as holding a cohesive narrative, Night School is a bit of a mess."
"The script is weak, the dialogue is flat, the acting is stiff, and most of all, the all-important love story that's supposed to give the film its emotional core just doesn't work."
It's unlikely that even WALL-E could bring himself to scoop up this movie and leave it on his post-apocalyptic junk heap.
"The down-for-anything cast, along with a handful of welcome cameos, can't prop up its weakest link: Seth MacFarlane."
"[W]ant[s] to be... ambitious SF drama. [But] somewhere along the way, the provocative speculation and the seriocomic tragedy got lost. Oh, and the characters got forgotten, too. Plus there's precious little authentic drama."
A solidly acted ensemble piece that wants to emulate the edgy shock/comedy of Trainspotting and Snatch but never quite finds its groove.
"What Random Acts of Violence has to say, it says clumsily, rushing to make its points before moving on to the next kill. There's nothing at all random about Baruchel's writing. He has designs. What he's lacking is purpose."
Features some of the worst acting this side of a high school play.
This one had the same paucity in wit and script issues as the whole Shrek series.
"An inoffensive, but forgettable remake. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"The film's mawkish laments for the passing of old-school gangsterdom, killed off by stringent anti-gang laws, are frankly ludicrous."
One to avoid.
Hamlet is a drama that should be larger than life. This version plays like a Fox network soap opera.
The title character is far too good for the movie he inhabits
Warner Bros second foray into Bollywood is a brainless masala potboiler.
Shooter is the very epitome of the kind of instantly disposable film that has become all too common a sight in recent months.
January is here.
An extended sitcom with a particularly raunchy streak that grows more and more artificial and hard to stomach as it proceeds.
A crash course from the start.
"The Super Mario Bros Movie barely feels like a movie at all. In fact, it often feels as though you’re watching someone play a video game. Badly, too."
"Even those who have spent the last 14 years pining for a sequel to ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" - by most accounts, the highest-grossing American romantic comedy - will rue that longing when they experience ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2."""
"A fitfully effective teen melodrama that ultimately focuses on the wrong person. Why should I care about the young man in love with a young woman, when then young woman's story is so much more interesting?"
The fires of Inferno don't burn particularly bright.
"If you've ever thought to yourself, ""Yeah, I use Google -- as a search engine, a map, a translator, a verb -- but I wish there was a way to get more Google in my life,"" then you're in luck."
"Like a bad mixtape created by the abominable Ark Music Factory, Rock of Ages is all flash and very, VERY little substance."
"Simply put, it's the worst film I've seen in ages."
"Takes its title from a real standing police order issued after the attacks and, seemingly, its inspiration from both nighttime soaps like EastEnders and the PBS Mystery! series."
So-so&#46;
Downhill lives up to its title. [Full review in Spanish]
This is a middling venture destined for English lit courses.
"The movie duplicates exactly my experience with the book, although I must say I was thankful to be spared serial outbreaks of hearty Greek dancing."
Leaves you wondering whether there really is a God.
Easily the most incoherent and irrelevant of Bryan Singer's X-Men movies.
"The latest (and by far most sneaky) attempt to slip one of its wrestlers into multiplexes, WWE Films' That's What I Am is surprisingly low on testosterone."
"Headshot is a great title for a wall-to-wall action film in which characters are repeatedly bludgeoned, shot and stabbed in the cranium."
"A typical arthouse road-trip flick, in that nothing exciting happens."
"Though you can't logically buy into the movie in the slightest, at least you can enjoy it for the lurid trash that it is."
After the mixed reviews of the last few Marvel films&#44; Ant-Man and the Wasp&#58; Quantumania looks set to continue the trend with the cast&#44; especially Majors&#44; stopping this from being a complete bore&#46;
"What you see is what you get with Bubble, a film that cant escape its own slightness even as it reaches for grand sentiment."
A new release has rarely felt so stillborn.
"In spite of the participation of a number of talented people, Full Moon in Blue Water is almost as immediately forgettable as its title."
"If you want to see all the cool special effects in this remake, watch the trailer. If you want the extreme environmentalist agenda that goes with them, buy a ticket."
"Hey, at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it's heading."
King deserves better.
"Should anyone ever be unfortunate enough to break bread with their characters in Dinner For Schmucks, you'd likely commit seppuku with your butter knife before the entrées had even been cleared from the table."
"The film's resolute failure is clearly a group effort requiring not just an awful script and flat-footed direction, but also terrible acting, an intrusive and derivative score, and a plot that seems to have been lifted from an unproduced Baretta teleplay."
"Luke Dawson's screenplay isn't bad, it's just pointlessly derivative."
"Madonna as a director has no discernible idea of how to locate a tone, or a provocative blend of tones. Her camera makes circles around its subjects every chance it gets in ways that evoke - nothing."
"A committed Bosworth gives herself over to the role. Yet, there's ultimately no real role for her to play-like her male co-stars, she's simply stuck embodying a series of clichd poses ..."
"It's silly, sure. Trouble is, it's not silly enough...The action sequences are a let down; mostly shot in swish pans, the loss of brightness that comes with 3D makes much of the movie look like a murky blur."
Ed Wood Jr.'s debacles were at least humorous.
"Valerian was pretty, but it's a mess."
An occasionally entertaining misfire that only scratches the surface of what a Venom movie could truly be.
"A wasteful, if painless, diversion."
Every conflict is undercut with a breezy reassurance that college is awesome!!
As mechanical as an old Disneyland automaton.
"It's all laughingly implausible, with Crowe's character coming across more like Nicholas Sparks than the sort of wordsmith able to craft prose that could compete with the Donna Tarts and Michael Chabons of the world."
[VIDEO ESSAY] Indolent pacing combines with tone-deaf dialogue for a movie that is a chore to endure.
Pathetic on just about every level.
"A documentary that never leaves any doubt about what comes next, while single-mindedly stumping for a cause presented as unique, is also not terribly interesting as a film."
Jonah Hex is a good performance and a few good lines buried in a script whose authors should do a little time in writer's hell for scribbling it.
Full of gorgeous architecture and sightlines but a bit too cold for comfort and with an all-too pervasive air of tedium.
"It's a shame, because pop star Moore continues to prove herself an adept actress."
"It gets by on its production value and the strength of another superb star turn from Jessica Rothe, but it's a disappointment compared to its unexpectedly winning predecessor."
"Unless you're an AOL Time Warner board member, there's nothing to like about this insipid live-action version of the 1970s cartoon series."
Its plot gets too slow even for open-ended movies such as this.
"Surprisingly fact-based at times, complete nonsense at others, yet ultimately inextricable from the evil regime that created it. A fascinating case study in how propaganda bends facts to suit its own agenda."
Hollywood psychopathology writ large&#46;

... fundamental laziness passes on into the story-telling.
"Horrible horror prequel has bloody violence, gore."
Jack Frost 2 never strikes the right balance between serious and silly.
We just don't get engaged.
Erin Brockovich is pretty pat and predictable stuff.
"...a movie suspended between bold novelistic invention and journalistic reserve. Be it demerit or credit, Jarecki is no Truman Capote and All Good Things is no In Cold Blood."
Robert D. Siegel delivers a meat-and-potatoes screenplay that offers very little nuance and chows down on banner statements that move the story along at a pace akin to an average McDonald's counter.
It would be almost likeable if it weren't for the contradictions that rip the guts out of the set-up.
"Low on context and consequence if not sex appeal, Gay Sex in the 70s is only desirable if Fleshbot is having a slow gay news week."
The Father of My Children loses focus and sags into a how-we-got-through-it family procedural.
"Director Tom Harper conveys this theme through dark, moldy-looking mise-en-scene and the uniformly sullen performances he elicits from the cast; you're more likely to find this depressing than scary."
"Tonie Marshall's quiet, unremarkable film has little real emotional pull."
"Sidney Lumet's all-black musical, starring Diana Ross, is a failed effort to transfer the setting of the Judy Graland musical to contempo Manhattan."
"Red Notice is an obnoxious, desperately unfunny bore that wastes a trio of talented leads. Dumb movies can be entertaining, but sometimes they're just flat-out bad."
"At first, the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious, but as the film goes on, the joke wears thin."
"It's as dull as it is brainless, the work of creators who've spent far more time concocting silly stories about Shakespeare than learning from him."
"Chery is a beautifully shot and (mostly) well-acted tale, but an overstuffed and flawed script does it no favors and ultimately leads to a film that is easily 30 minutes too long."
About half an hour worth of story seasoned with a lot of sex and other padding. More failed experiment in speed film production than serious attempt at making a feature film.
"It is so lacking in flesh-and-blood characters, so unclear in its depiction of battles like Bull Run, and so nauseating in its gruesome sentimentality that it is all but unwatchable."
"Made up of remnants from other, better films."
"For all its brain teasing, Final Cut is more a philosophical rumination than an engaging drama."
"This movie is a shoddy, messy wreck. Tonally speaking, it's off, the editing is terrible."
"When it's not getting bogged down in cliches, I Am Number Four is decent fun, even if it does feel very familiar and ultimately forgettable."
Let's Be Cops raises the occasional smile but is so generic it feels like a thousand other comedies that came before it.
Only comes to life during a Texan steak-eating contest that has Babs ingest a mountain of meat.
"Despite a couple of half-hearted, half-baked twists tossed in at the last minute, the story never feels fully fleshed."
"[Pandorum] might seem like a potentially cool movie, but unfortunately the key word is ""potentially""."
The humor falls flat and the film is too long. Hopefully we won't see more of this particular franchise.
"So damn incredible, it put me to sleep."
This freshman effort from the French team of David Moreau and Xavier Palud would rate an A in film school. But that doesn't mean it's worth seeing.
"The script is one shockingly drab line after another, and nothing in the expensive 1930s period design can cover up the shabbiness of the moviemaking."
"Christian Tafdrup's film is little more than an exercise in slick, soul-deadening savagery."
"If your idea of a good time is watching your favorite cartoon classics butchered by a CGI dog and a creepy baby resembling a deleted scene from The Polar Express, then..."
Let's just hope Hillary Swank remains too big to do a #2.
An underwhelming exercise in sound and fury striclty for brains on pause. .
A shamelessly hagiographic chronicling of the final months of the Great Emancipator's life.
"Many fine talents are thrown into this witch's cauldron of chopped-off bits from other horror films, but it doesn't cohere."
"Everything is ramped-up, hyper, effortful and constructed. Very rarely are things just allowed to be, a silence allowed to reign, or a real human moment allowed to bloom."
"Rooting a film ... in personal revenge is one of the cheapest, laziest and most retrograde approaches possible."
"An arthouse thriller of a sort, it isn't concerned with the niceties of story or characters. It's a kinetic exercise in abstruseness, one that conjures up a feeling of unease but little else."
So overloaded with mannered style that its deliberately glacial pacing ultimately outstays its welcome and its messaging becomes muddied.
Annie lands in an uninventive middle ground - it isn't necessary (or an improvement) but it isn't a total disaster either.
"Having real-life Navy SEALs play fictional versions of themselves results in some convincing action scenes, and dialogue more wooden than a dime store Indian."
"When anyone's not delivering the groaners that pass for zingers, someone bumps into something and has a 'hilarious' pratfall."
"Decent voices, pitifully unimpressive animation in service of a story that barely deserves the label ""story."""
"""The Hero of Color City"" was made for five-year-olds and is unashamedly derivative of ""Toy Story."""
"[Lacks] the flash and style, or even bona fide scares, of [Romero's] earlier work."
"Tries so hard to be natural, somehow feels like it's wearing a little too much mascara."
"A shrill, garish hodgepodge of familiar elements from other animated vehicles (most evidently 2013's Epic), there's virtually nothing about this forced, fractured fairy tale that feels remotely fresh or involving."
It is almost as if Boorman were obliging some film-industry requirement to get the thing on record as opulently as possible and be done with it. The result is an expensive excursion into very safe territory. You'd think it could have been more.
"I can't think of a single kind word to say about this unfortunate family comedy which is unoriginal, predictable, schmaltzy and bland."
"...has 'class' and 'prestige' branded on every frame. It's about first loves, second chances and never giving up. Cue the pounding hooves and swelling music."
It's so knowingly cute that most of its jokes go nowhere.

The approach ... is relentlessly cynical and depressing.
"For the second straight time, Quentin Tarantino has made a mean, ugly movie that revels in the grotesque mutilation of a woman at the hands of a man."
"There are some good scenes in Crowe's directorial debut, but it mostly feels like a fumbled opportunity to make a much more significant film."
"Renders a bland, mall-bought local flavor."
"Life is messy, but you wouldn't know it from watching this film."
"The film is streamlined so it can be just another Conjuring spinoff. And like those films, the grace of the Warrens is literally and figuratively far removed from this house."
"Maybe Burlesque will serve as the imitation goods that spurs a consumer revolution for something more authentic. Aw, who am I kidding? It won't."
"Rodin could be elegant, worthy, neat and nice... but it's also a wasted opportunity [Full review in Spanish]"
The beasts may be fantastic but the movie isn't.
"The script has zero curiosity about any of these characters and their motivations. Why are they here? What are their powers, exactly? If kids just past puberty are such lethal fighters, how did the whole race of them get wiped out?"
"By the movie's midpoint, the Wachowski brothers' screenplay has gotten so bogged down in back story that it takes 40 minutes for director James McTiegue to get back to the explosions that his 16-year-old target audience assumes will solve everything."
"The one thing this film has going for it, is Nathalie Baye in the starring role."
Witness the encomia extended by some to Yann Gonzalez's Knife+Heart.
"Though the cinematography looks sleek, with shots through windows and in mirrors, split screens and city lights that blur and sharpen, the stories equate to a tangled mess."
"It is disappointing that this flimsy B-movie isn't better, because once it sets up its formulaic plot, it could have been both naughty and wild."
"Unfortunately, director Olivia Newman and screenwriter Lucy Alibar have delivered a film which is superficially pleasing to the eye but never makes its hard-scrabble themes punch home convincingly."
"Remarkably, Lucas solicits even worse performances than in pictures past; the Mace Windu-Palpatine confrontation ranks amongst the worst acted scenes I've ever seen."
Catch & Release? Nah. Try Net & Forget.
A mess of a genre picture that is easily one of the most tonally confused movies I've seen in years.
There's an inherent danger in filling in all the gaps of a story whose power lies in its omissions.
Wisemen started out with a great idea and couldn't summon the vision to make it happen.
The Purge: Anarchy is little more than a pointless exercise in bad taste featuring bland protagonists and ugly antagonists caught up in an endless cycle of brutality.
"Aiming for something blithe and effervescent but with a nugget of emotion at the core, Anderson has instead produced a mangy, ragged ode to his youthful dreams and cherished memories."
"A drab dive into a neo-noir landscape that, at times, flirts with grit but, often, just seems unmoored in a strange fantasy arena without anything to hold it in place."
"Predictable romcom mixes racy content, sexist messages."
It is impossible to take a movie seriously when the movie obviously doesn't care if you do or not.
Yu might as well look at the background; you are not missing much in the foreground.
"A meandering, slow journey with a fairly bland leading character."
A comedy-action movie that begins far more engagingly than it ends.
"I don't mind not thinking too hard if I'm going to get something out of it at some point, but this is more like a self-perpetuating Ouroboros loop of not thinking too hard."
I like everything about it except it.
A loathsome low-budget thriller that's only distinguished by its ability to juggle grotesque sadism and stultifying boredom.
I don't see how anybody could find anything to like about this movie.
"If only the plot were a little less obvious, the confrontations a little less cliched."
"There is nothing wrong with its reach, but its grasp of genre elements is random."
"It's shallow and self-congratulatory, refusing to justify its incessant violence with character development or genre spectacle."
"The film shows an extreme, anti-traditionalist and anti-white position, to which the only real and true History of the United States is the black History. [Full review in Spanish]"
There are some solid performances...but Operation Finale doesn't quite do this story justice.
There has not been a worse movie released this year.
Monologues and melodrama rarely work in contemporary movies exploring social ills.
"In simultaneously successfully shoving in every little thing and thus ruining the book, director John Crowley and writer Peter Straughan have killed two birds with one stone."
This story turns out to be much more mundane than its outrageously clever premise.
Neither interesting nor particularly silly.
Not even one truly likeable character to be seen in this movie.
This movie is every bit the mess its title makes it sound.
A lengthy procession of geriatric-assassin jokes [that] offers a chilling portent of what lies in store should soon-to-be-ex-Governor Schwarzenegger ever return to the big screen.
"Roman action epic comes across as grim, violent, and dull."
"Marion Cotillard tears up all the available scenery in this overblown, achronological biopic of French pop singer Edith Piaf."
"Too many ""big"" moments are happening to too many people for the movie to feel plausible, and Tauber tries to tie many of those plots together in a way that seems contrived."
Any self-respecting lesbian should rear up in horror at [this movie].
"Think gore, gore and more gore. That's all the filmmakers can deliver from a concept that's already broken its teeth."
"Sandstorms, spiders, crows, rats, zombies... lots of zombies. Alas, nothing as exciting as a WWE star on his way to becoming Hollywood legend."
It never is afraid to simplify itself further so that no one watching feels left out of its banality.
"It bored me, even with the chilling ending."
There's nothing here a good dose of Viagra couldn't cure. Impotent and dull as dishwater.
"Peter Strickland’s playful mockery of performance art and excessively serious-minded “collectives” feels both insular and, at times, a shade too flavorless."
"Shall We Dance? stumbles into a tight corner between comedy and romance, failing to satisfy on either count."
"If you want to see a completely by-the-numbers Hollywood biopic that indulges a sort of surface-level myth-making, ""42"" is that film, and I suspect that's exactly the film they set out to make."
A badly miscast and sadly stagnant collegiate rip-off of When Harry Met Sally.
The only thing that seems to work in this sappy romance is how sappy it is.
"As a comedy, The Mask is genial, but its recycled plot is far too thin for the film to succeed as either an adventure or a spoof."
"The audience seems likely to leave feeling scolded or pandered to, depending. Not a great time."
Cheap special effects and nonexistent horror in a 'horror' flick make for one boring waste of celluloid.
There&#8217;s just not enough here to make the revisiting of 2020&#44; even in a staging this fresh&#44; worth our precious time&#46; Maybe go for a walk instead&#46;
"Oh, O'Horten, how wincingly affected you are."
"Respectable but bland, the movie's gentle sentimentality could easily be forgiven if only its characters were granted a little more depth."
"The more time passes, the more this ""Slap Shot"" seems wide of the net."
"A Rainy Day in New York feels like something that belongs in a museum, preferably in storage."
"More expository than the lovely, fragile Sunshine State, the slow-burning Silver City may be equally spare but has none of its southern comfort."
"Lions for Lambs is, to put it mildly, beyond stagey."
"A familiar cliché-ridden backstage showbiz film that's been done a million times before, but mostly better."
I'm sure Cameron Crowe will bounce back and make some more great films... but most will acknowledge that Aloha is a failure.
"Well-meaning, sort of sweet, but can't really get it together: That describes both Kevin James' character and his new movie, ""Zookeeper."""
"It's watchable but absolutely no big deal, although you wouldn't know that from the drum-heavy score, so loud and militaristic that someone could reuse it for a documentary about the Battle of the Bulge."
It's last year's overrated Ray with an all-white cast -- and it's ultimately about as dramatically inert.
"Perry seems to be going through the motions on this one, repeating the platitudes and relationship angst that he's trotted out a half-dozen times already."
"Mr. Berling's male protagonist concludes that love is all that matters, but it is said more than it's felt, and told more than it's shown."
While I appreciate the ambition... all it made me do is want to watch the one from 1960.
"A movie that stayed rigorously inside its heroine's muzzled sense of frustration could be compelling, but Jackson keeps cutting to superfluous subplots."
I charge director Tony Goldwyn and screenwriter Pamela Gray with ineffective assistance of counsel.
"If nothing else, Death of a Nation makes it clear that the lies are bigger than ever, and we can't afford to pretend they're going to stop any time soon."
The film comes up short on insight into its characters.
"A bizarre, goofy, almost unbelievably awful reworking of the legend [that] belongs near the very bottom in the Robin Hood hall of shame, not just among the worst versions of the story but the worst movies of the year."
"In the post Dark City, Matrix, eXistenZ cinematic world, it has a decided 'been there, done that' sensibility."
There is undoubtedly a compelling story to be found within Midnight's Children... but the lack of focus means that it feels more like a vignette than the main narrative it perhaps should have been.
"Emma Thompson is normally a very reliable performer on screen, but Beatrice is not one of her successes."
The filmmakers here were seemingly so sure on which side of the line Hamer and Gault stood that they missed any opportunity to make the audience wonder.
So transparent in its commercialization that Kygo&#8217;s &#8220;Higher Love&#8221; remix as the end credits song was like a perfect final bow&#46; Anthony McCarten really is the Arby&apos;s of musical biopics&#46;
"If nothing else, Todd Phillips's Joker proves that two scenes do not a movie make."
Frosty and oddly cast
"As a broad family comedy this is perfectly acceptable, but from a sci-fi point of view it's a very pale imitation of the time travel classics it seeks to ape."
"Apart from the creepy vibe and a hilariously unhinged performance by Nicolas Cage, director Richard Stanley's hallucinatory horror movie Color Out of Space is to be experienced with the eyes and not with the head."
Poignancy is overwhelmed by sentimentality in this ambitious attempt to illustrate one man's struggle to cope with senseless trauma.
"Though [director] Feig has said he was aiming for the spirit of films by John Landis (Animal House), Unaccompanied Minors more closely resembles the lesser movies of director-producer John Hughes."
"With a two and a half hour runtime and a shaky premise, there's a lot left to be desired here."
Why is it that serial killers in bad movies and books seem to be less interested in murdering their victims than mounting conceptual art projects?
A routine movie that's full of talk but thin with comprehension.
The transformation of Jackson's Middle Earth into alt-Tolkien fan fiction is complete.
"This was already tired stuff when cult fave Sleepaway Camp came out in 1983, and it's downright comatose by now."
"Blame it all on the Bad Guys, those Hollywood suits who think by committee and never met a focus group they didn't like. This is product, pure and simple."
Rapid-fire disturbing images in paranoid thriller.
This heartfelt love letter to classic European cinema is also an implausible and uninspired trifle content to rehash familiar themes while relying on variations of characters we've seen plenty of times before.
Best way to ensure a film isn't taken too seriously? Cast Leslie Nielsen of Naked Gun fame as president of the United States. That'll do the trick.
"""Argo"" is one more example of how Hollywood waters down its movies for mass consumption. They need to try harder. Much, much harder."
"""The Identical"" occupies a neglected niche as a family-friendly movie that isn't geared just toward kids. But living up to a legend is an uphill battle, and the movie doesn't ever reach those heights."
It gave me the creeps.
A misfire in the always interesting career of director Martin Scorsese.
"""The Daughter"" is a quiet, immensely affecting triumph that proves how, contrary to accepted wisdom, there are secrets that would better remain untold."
"A story that's no more profound than Frankenstein, yet grabs for IQ points by having characters debate bio-ethics every three minutes."
"Formidable, if incoherent, action-packed thriller, filled with dastardly double-crosses, greed and revenge."
"Conversations with God is a bad film about good things that many people will find enlightening. Its message is admirable, its filmmaking as bland as a communion wafer."
"As an exercise in preconception-shattering, it works reasonably well. But as the characters veer between petulance and intimacy and back again - often within the same verbal exchange - the situation never really rings true."
"Ironically, for a film about a violent massive fire, it is completely devoid of warmth. [Full review in Spanish]"
Both the beauty and her beastly pursuer remain too blankly generic for the implications of the movie's main metaphor to come through vividly.
"It’s a known fact that Mikkelsen and Iversen made it home, but “Against the Ice” doesn’t succeed in making us feel anything when they do."
The novelty of watching De Niro and Pacino team up wears off pretty quickly.
"Rabid with a female lens isn't camp, it isn't satire. The Soska Sisters's take on Cronenberg's cannibalistic horror film is full of empty calories."
"Too cute by half, filled with myriad forced moments of magic, O'Horten attempts to cast a nuanced spell, but ends up making rather little impression at all."
The movie is going for a wistful romanticism. For me it was more like a pervy sociopathy.
"If nothing else, this should command the attention of kids who have grown tired of having their pictures taken with Santa."
"The scenes between Depp and Morton throw off sparks, but the movie as a whole needs focus, oomph."
"A workmanlike product that offers occasional, small moments of satisfaction, but, as a whole, is apt to leave audiences wondering why they should care."
"[Crash] is familiar enough that it slips easily into our film-watching faculty without any fuss, yet [Haggis'] handling of it -- his muscular belief in what he is doing -- makes us hope that his next screenplay will be a bit less safe."
"It's got a major director, a major cast, it's based on a major, award-winning book trilogy, and it's just a major disaster."
The real mystery: How did a spine-tingling bestseller turn into a plodding Lifetime-esque melodrama that's devoid of suspense?
Thoroughly surprising and far from unsatisfactory.
"While the light and whimsical comic timing of the leads carry the film far, even they cannot blind us to Gray Matters' many shortcomings."
Mile 22 had all the ingredients to be an absurdly entertaining B-movie and yet it falls short of those modest expectations because it takes itself way too seriously and fails to deliver the most basest thrills.
"What eventually saves ""Adaline"" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through."
"The film is said to have been inspired by a true story, but the inspiration was insufficient, even though Mr. Asch has a strong sense of place and displays a confident touch with some of the action sequences."
...an ambitious failure...
A particularly snoozy offering of sinister business.
"Although it's not bad, I found it overrated, as it tells a story through a trite narrative formula and flat characters that we've already been seen in dozens of films. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Exactly why would anyone visit a dinosaur-infested island for a fifth time, when all four previous excursions had ended in limb-gobbling pandemonium?"
"Gorgeously dark with heartbreaking moments, American Pastoral isn't smart enough to have the prestige factor it's clearly going for."
"Sadly, while the intention may be a Big Fish-esque rumination on everyone's penchant for self-mythologizing, it's more a Sliding Doors-style tale of shoulda, woulda, coulda that never quite does."
"Beyond the opening frames, the whole movie has an altogether musty odour, as if those up-to-the-minute lines had simply been tacked on to a mothballed script."
"full of spirit, but it's all empty calories"
M. Night Shyamalan's worst film.
"Director Gaspar Noé proved a shock poet in Irreversible. In Enter the Void, he's a shockingly tedious show-off."
"Writer-director Robert Zemeckis follows Charles Dickens' 1843 novella, A Christmas Carol, so closely that he even makes the same error the author made with the first edition of the book."
The film winds up looking like an ashen video game. It's even more muddy in IMAX and 3-D.
"For those of us keeping score, we are now 0-4 for modern Terminator sequels -- maybe it really is time to say goodbye."
"If there is one positive thing about Duplex, and saying this requires a huge amount of charity, it's the performance by little known Eileen Essel, who musters whatever grace and genuine humour this sad little picture can manage."
In the 99 very slow minutes an expected jump or two is about all you get. And they're not even that good.
"There's the germ of a very good action-comedy franchise in Puerto Ricans in Paris...A tighter script, a more urgent mystery and a bit more connection between the stars would have come in handy."
Action Point doesn't bother with much in the way of a plot.
The film as a whole is a real mess. Not that it matters. The Chinese market is going to ensure that we are treated to Warcraft stories for years to come.
"Hamstrung by a feeling that its director was striving for oddity, purely for oddity's sake."
"The social element is undeveloped, uncritically approached, and that largely shapes the piece."
"Rendering the Red Baron-fighting Snoopy and way too many supporting characters in 3-D, and placing them in near-photo-realistic backgrounds, drains much of the charm from ""The Peanuts Movie."""
"Frenetic and fanciful - with a confusing ""moving forward"" plot that encompasses abandonment, adoption, embarrassment and vengeance."
"Incredibly, this screen adaptation is rated PG-13, which means that parents, who will probably find it excruciatingly simpleminded, are cautioned to keep it away from their middle school children, the only viewers who might possibly enjoy it."
It's sluggish and trite and irrelevant in a way that suggests that the TV soundstage is a kind of hothouse that Radnor doesn't leave often enough.
"Even if it were good, the best this movie could have hoped for was to be an imitation of something that was already perfect to begin with."
"The design is bright and there are in-jokes for the emoji users among parents, but even with his history of great voice work (see Big Hero 6) Miller sounds like he's throwing his lines into a void."
"The sequel to 2016's animated hit is even thinner on plot than the first one, whose title promised a look behind the scenes and inside the minds of cats and dogs."
"Seems to have been cut on a tight deadline: Gangster Gary Oldman all but disappears after his Tommy gun-blazing entrance, and Jessica Chastain has little to do as an unlikely refugee-stripper turned Bondurant waitress-mascot."
"""We Bought a Zoo'' is a sweet-natured, terribly unthreatening drama about redemption and renewal, and it may matter more to the man who made it than the audiences who see it."
"If this perfunctory adaptation is all we're going to get out of some of King's most iconic works, perhaps they should stay buried."
It's dumb.
"Director Emily Harris' de-fanged adaptation follows plenty of other versions of the novella, zeroing in on the ""lesbian vampire"" aspect, but the result is deathly dull."
"Never deviates from the romantic comedy guidebook. It delivers exactly what you would expect, and nothing further; tears, laughter, romance, and plenty of cute baby moments, awkwardly wrapped in a tragic situation."
"But this movie is hard to take. Sorry, go back to your own planet."
"The long shadow of David Fincher's Seven falls on Anamorph, a moody, ultimately unexciting thriller."
"This is a film that wants to be the next The Hateful Eight or even Bad Times at the El Royale, but lacks both the script and flair behind the camera to be anything more than both crazily contrived and head-smackingly predictable."
Billy the Kid never realizes its potential because Venditti is unable to let viewers discover her subject anonymously - the way the best documentaries do.
"`Martin Lawrence Live' is so self-pitying, I almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show."
"A nasty concept is nice, but then you gotta do something with it."
I cannot imagine ranking it anywhere other than dead last out of the 31 features presently constituting the Marvel Cinematic Universe&#46;
"At two points, it is noted that images are seen through the wrong end of a telescope, with the assertion that ""it's not nostalgia. It's heartache for all that's lost."" For me, that became apparent long before the film's drawn out conclusion."
Instantly forgettable...
It buries a talented cast beneath jokes that have been canned and stored in bomb shelters since the Cold War.
"Almost nothing in this ultimate J.R.R. Tolkien episode rings true, least of all its empty spectacle of digital effects. The sum total is Two Towers and more of babel."
"Though there's not a lot of night action, you'd think the whole thing had been shot during an eclipse. Apparently the visual shorthand for 1st-millennium England is murkiness."
"Clearly took one funny movie about Tim's relationships and succumbed to the Hollywood pandergeist ""we're making a movie with Dinner in the title, there is gonna be a damn dinner!"" But Carell makes it very sweet."
It's hard not to wonder if Foxx owed somebody a favor when he signed on to make a movie this amateurish.
A defective vehicle that cannot convey its urgent message. [Full review in Spanish]
"All of this goes down very, very slowly. Joshua aspires to be a kind of Rosemary's Baby's Older Brother by way of Gaslight, but it lacks the dynamism and atmosphere of either of those inspirations."
"It would appear that this new franchise is finally starting to show a little weakness, for what Singer delivers with X-Men: Apocalypse doesn't even come close to reaching the quality of the films that preceded it."
Story can't infuse this juvenile hunk of entertainment with either the wit or the savvy to make it seem like anything more than an overblown version of Saturday- morning TV.
"Miller keeps the production frustratingly mild and uneventful, relying on his cast to stir up antagonisms, only they aren't invested in the flaccid case and filmmaking presented."
Crowe seems unable to layer up the story's sentimentalism with anything subtler than an industrial dumper truck.
It didn't evoke more than the occasional smile from this viewer.
"This drama, which was bankrolled by the people behind the international Operation Smile program, has the best of intentions. But it's so painfully earnest that it becomes insufferable."
"The least interesting question to ask about a movie like ""Dragon Blade"" is whether it's any good. Of course it isn't, not especially, but questions of quality pale next to the greater headscratcher: What is it?"
"So easy to get behind thematically and one with fascinating subject matter, but it's a movie that never gets over some of the stereotypes of its subject matter to present a fully-formed, relatable, human drama."
Even a Sixth Sense-style twist at the end isn't enough to redeem Now & Forever.
"Most of the actual sex has less erotic value than what can be found on late night HBO, and it certainly doesn't hold a candle to the graphic content of the novels or the erotic-charged hype surrounding the film."
"In the end, Born to Be Wild insults the intelligence of both children and adults, and, therefore, is worth nobody's precious time."
"This slender, increasingly monotonous stalker plot feels ludicrously overintellectualized -- full of hot air. To paraphrase Freud, sometimes a balloon is just a balloon."
"""Something Borrowed"" is something ... ew."
"The only way this Twilight Zone-wannabe movie works is that if, after buying into the premise, you turn off your mind, suspending all rational thought processes."
"It drifts along in its own sort of doldrums, two minutes of not terribly exciting story followed by ten minutes of special effects, some of which are dandy, most of which demonstrate the textbook definition of overkill."
"This is one off-the-wall sex comedy. It is even occasionally actually funny in its offbeat fashion, but it is essentially stupid and the forays into sexual violence are downright ugly."
"There's no sense of craftsmanship or creativity here, just the bare minimum to meet enough clichs to get to the final act and send you on your way. It has all the thrills of a root canal."
"After peaking with the unsurpassable glories of 2003's Bad Santa, the humbug holiday genre may be getting run into the ground."
"What could possibly go wrong with this formula? Threequel-itis, that's what. MIB 1 was great, MIB 2 not so much, MIB 3-just not cuttin' the mustard."
"It can convey tension and mystery, but its scripts aren't solid and the outcomes seem to be invented on the fly. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The movie feels a little off from the beginning. The dialogue works less effectively as dialogue, rather than dialogue quoted in various correspondence. It's arch without being especially witty."
"Ferrellman doesn't so much adjust to the adult world around him as he makes it bend to his stubborn, outrageous will."
"""A watchable generic comedy. It's okay for a night out or a DVD, but it's hard to call it good."""
"Has there ever been a more insipid sci-fi action film than Soldier? Probably, although it's hard to imagine."
Tries hard to turn Ferrell/Hart into Wilder/Pryor but fails miserably.
"If you don't know from the beginning how the film's emotional arc is going to play out, then you just haven't seen enough mediocre movies."
"Simon Pegg is likably smart and obnoxious as the fish-out-of-water Brit in high-gloss Manhattan, but he's swimming upstream in a feature that substitutes slapstick for scathing wit."
Close to unendurable.
"Bob Fosse's direction is as chaotic as it was in his previous Sweet Charity, a desperate scramble after a style."
Oozes condescension from every pore.
"Vaughn's con-man jive doesn't get much play in this one; he spends most of his time as a bitter creep, and the writing (by Dan Fogelman) isn't sharp enough to make the hipster-at-the-North-Pole theme pay off in any meaningful way."
Frantz plays at times like a parody of an arthouse movie.
"Nanny McPhee is clever enough, but it never feels like it's hitting quite the right notes."
Theodore Geisel isn't merely rolling over in his grave -- he's spinning so fast that he's splintering the coffin around him into shards appropriate for teeth-picking.
"Let's put it this way: five years from now when you're talking about Oldboy, nobody's going to say 'Which one?'"
"Instead of fanning the franchise flames, A Dame to Kill For tosses a wet blanket on the fun, stumbling with a plodding follow-up that's missing the insanity and most of the grim highlights that made the original so memorable."
"If [Troy] was a Pitt-fall, this is a stumbling Stone."
"While engaging, pic eventually betrays itself as having a trivial attitude to its chosen subject."
"The story Mr. Ross has come up with suggests that he wants to say something about desire and jealousy, but he hasn't given Frank enough of an inner life to make the character's transformation from a besotted lover into a distrustful one plausible."
"Not a total loss, but it's disappointing, given what the movie might have been. It might have been more than a lengthy sitcom."
Nothing very exciting goes on.
"Thomas trudges through the film's action sequences with such obvious disinterest that when Wilson turns from a lackluster fireball to quip, 'Whoa, that was a big explosion,' you really know he's putting us on."
"Look, people doing dumb things in a horror movie is par for the course. Heck, it's even part of the fun. But there becomes a point where things can get taken a step too far."
"...had its heart in the right place, but in order to have a shred of believability, it needed more grit. The Tuohys are cardboard saints with a big bank account and Oher is their big lump of clay."
"Fierce and ferocious, filled with relentless, kinetic, if senseless, violent mayhem."
"Crushingly humorless, Match Point also has a grade-school-simple Major Theme: At the outset, Chris's narration informs us that life is luck, and at any point we could win or lose. Whoa."
The Master of Diguise is this year's first truly stillborn comedy.
"Chernobyl Diaries has an intriguing premise and makes a commendable stab at subverting expectations, but it ultimately fails to deliver in terms of either gore, suspense or scares."
Sick semper tyrannis!
But &quot;transgressive&quot; doesn&apos;t always translate to &quot;interesting&#46;&quot; For those thinking No&#233; may have turned a corner with 2018&apos;s &lt;i&gt;Climax&#44; Lux &#198;terna&lt;&#47;i&gt; represents an unfortunate step back&#46;
Exceedingly tiresome.
A shapeless comedy of little merit.
"But in its frozen-in-time sensibilities, its stubborn refusal to engage with the evolution of the police-procedural genre, The Little Things arrives with a deflated, why-bother sense of futility."
"Agitprop that doesn't convince, comedy that isn't very funny."
"Thinks that it's smarter than it really is, and funnier than it really is. [Full review in Spanish]"
"There seemed to be little reason to remake a film so vital to Disney's history. If the original film was a tale as old as time, this new version is a tale as old as nostalgia."
An overlong and slightly pretentious indie effort.
Only as bad as ordinary bad films and not as bad as getting your eyelid caught on a nail.
It's neither an upgrade nor an update -- just more of the same and less of what made the movie's predecessor charmingly clever.
"On paper this sequel has some promising elements, but on screen it retreats from the very issues that it raises, and on a shelf next to ""Captain America: The First Avenger,"" ""The Winter Soldier"" is pale."
The auteur's unbeatable weirdness here mutates into preciosity.
"Kevin Smith's safest movie to date, but italso his most adult, an attempt to move beyond the comic book fantasy world in which he has lived for so long and try something new."
"The voices are colorful and vivid, but the tale is so conventional and outdated and the direction so pedestrian that it's truly a mishmash."
"Aside from bad filmmaking, I don't know what any of this means."
"Too often Vaughn oversteps his mark when his stylised use of violence is played out as entertainment, with young Moretz as the main attraction."
Strives to be a James Bond spoof but fails to find its niche.
"A film that, while watchable, makes little use of its stars or premise."
The problem is the enervated pacing and ludicrous depiction - after much fancy skipping back and forth in time - of the murders themselves.
"... one hopes, perhaps naively, that there'd be some kind of message amid the special effects and nubile bodies."
"The story of the victims on the road is harrowing, but the tale of the kind cop and the teenager with an attitude is a string of big brother clichés."
"Coppola has gone uprriver again in an effort to reinvent himself and cinema in the process. He ultimately fails, but he can't be faulted for trying."
The ideas are funnier than the images.
"A hokey summer entertainment that is full of big machinery, satellite dishes du jour, long embarrassing close-ups and gaps in logic through which large UFOs could hurtle."
"As amusing as a ""hand-job,"" and about as intimate."
"The result is Get Carter for dummies, the biggest ones being those who pay to see it. It's also an incoherent, irredeemable mess."
"Pixar's longtime domination of the animation world takes its toll, as generational rifts and/or personal neuroses are what gets treated here."
"Plays like a cross between Hitchcock and tabloid feminism, a mix that shouldn't work and doesn't."
"""First Match"" is a culturally significant, capably-crafted film, but it leans on safe familiarities when it should seek risky rewards."
If the straight-to-DVD quality of &#8220;DC League of Super-Pets&#8221; is any indication for future projects targeted at children&#44; Warner Bros&#46; will have a lot more to worry about than a guinea pig with kryptonite&#46; 
"Far be it from me to spoil the secret, but I will say this: The last reel should've been sent straight to the city dump."
"Blathers on like an unoriginal stand-up's meandering riff on 'Remember when you used to have sex all the time?' Pathetically prudish in its avoidance of frontal nudity and its finale, where Annie and Jay watch their tape, cringing and wincing all the way"
"Death on the Nile is much too slow of a stroll down the river to make the mystery thrilling, no matter what actors are lined up to be suspects."
"A stilted, yet-another-British-gangster thriller - a remarkable disappointment given its pukka cast."
Director James Wan hits the grisly button without shame.
In a perfect world&#44; there&apos;s probably a middle ground between the 2015 movie and this remake&#46;&#46;&#46;
"There is a sharp, sublime Almodvar film trapped inside the blurry outlines of Franois Ozon's The New Girlfriend, as if aching to get out."
"Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will."
It doesn't make you laugh and it doesn't make you cry. It just makes you feel icky.
A slow-moving piece of garbage with choppy fight sequences and bad acting.
Oh...whatever.
Let it go to voice mail.
"Some good scenes, a very good leading man but dramatically just another altar call for the already-saved."
"French filmmakers have often been at odds with the Hollywood juggernaut. With My Best Friend, Leconte seems to be throwing up his hands. If you can't beat them, join them."
"To paraphrase a far greater expert in the heist genre, David Mamet, After The Sunset is like having Elmore Leonard puke and then that puke wrote the script."
"Robert Downey Jr. gives a strong, Oscar-nominated performance, but Attenborough's disappointingly formulaic biopic doesn't capture Chaplin's genius as artist or his complex life"
"It leaves style as the only sustenance. In Fabric has bags of it, but it's hardly meaningful when there's little in the way of thematic juiciness."
Handsome but hollow.
"While The First Purge's righteous anger and lack of subtlety lend it a sense of vitality in the excellent action sequences, the storytelling is a clumsy mess."
"This sort of stuff is magnificently silly, and Lee, to give him credit, never tried to rise above it."
"Innocence meets experience, unconvincingly, in the strained redemption drama ""33 Postcards."""
"Returning Mickey Stern is a sweet, well-intended picture, but like its title character, it is not quite good enough for the big leagues."
"Another serving of the American sex comedy series back by popular demand, allegedly."
"Because the new film's magic carpet is following in the flight plan of its animated ancestor, it can't reach new heights on its own."
Earnest but amateurish.
I'm not sure stronger hands could prevent this script from going as far into melodrama as it does.
It's a work of hagiography that serves neither history nor its subject well.
"A misguided documentary that mistakes cutesy, polished aesthetics for meaningful sentiment."
It's a bit rote as both a PTSD and home invasion picture.
Three Thousand Years of Longing is a mediocre time-passer that&#8217;s something a bit different for Miller&#46;
This film is a whole lot of wasted potential because with just a little more polish on the story and acting it could have been incredibly subversive and frightening.
"There isn't much funny about this film billed as a comedy, even with a great cast including Melissa McCarthy, Chris O'Dowd and Kevin Klein. The film has some sweet moments but it is more depressing than anything else."
"This title struggles to stand out from the crowd, tedious and uninspiring, suffocated by its very own lack of imagination."
"When cowering and begging at the feet a scruffy Giannini, Madonna gives her best performance since Abel Ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his Dangerous Game."
"The main problem with Stargate is not with set-up, but with execution. After a while you feel like you're just watching weird people staggering around a desert."
At it's best is more reminiscent of forgotten '80s comedies like Club Paradise (1986) or Hot Pursuit (1987).
"Part stoner comedy, midnight movie, outsiders' love story and ultraviolent B-movie, this intriguing film is given real soul by stars Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart. But the ambitions end up being more laudable than the results."
It was the first time sex in a movie made me want to cover my ears.
Condon and his team have alchemized gold into lead.
"If nothing else, the deranged plotting of this most unwieldy chapter should instill a hearty sense of awe for what children are willing to consume."
"Some nice touches and a welcome determination to do the rom-com thing differently, but the laughs just aren't there."
"Both formally and narratively, The Death Cure feels like a patchwork, Frankensteined together from better material."
&#91;Much&#93; like with &#8220;Slumber Party Alien Abduction&#44;&#8221; there is a nifty idea sitting at the center of Kids vs&#46; Aliens&#46; Too bad Eisner and his talented team don&#8217;t end up doing anything equally nifty with it&#46;
It hurts to see a terrific cast (including the lovely and intelligent young Irish actress Romola Garai as the couple's quietly seething daughter) squandered on such dreary filmmaking.
The majority of the film strives for ethereal lyricism but the melodrama of these lives never proves strong enough to anchor any real emotional connection.
"Shyamalan is a considerable talent, but he's become too powerful too young. The sign I discern hanging over his career at the moment reads Wrong Way."
"""Dead in a Week"" strains too hard to find the lighter side of professional murder - like a Coen brothers version of ""John Wick,"" but without the inspired touch of either."
"The transformation of ""Ghost Story"" from novel to film is this year's best example of why some writers hate to see their books made into movies."
"Coppola's dialogue is remorselessly authentic in its inanity, and this blankness runs deep in what finally feels a shallow film about shallow people."
"The film begins after Debbie's death, with Raymond watching a documentary about her life. No sooner has this started than the action switches to a second documentary. Even Citizen Kane only needed one documentary-within-the-film, for goodness sake."
"a story where the woman in question is never asked what she might want, as though she were in some kind of arranged affair instead of marriage"
"Moves to the formulaic beats of the second-rate TV movie, albeit one cloaked in an ultra-glossy sheen."
"In the autumn of his career, toiling exclusively in Europe, Woody is like an aging cabinet maker still blessed with craft but grown erratic in design."
It&#8217;s not wild or extreme enough to satisfy any cravings one has for a Cronenberg film&#46; It&#8217;s one solid re-write away from a truly mesmerising film&#46;
Great performances can't hide a shallow plot and ridiculous contrivances.
"Aside from some cosmetic changes, little of what this Fright Night offers elevates it above the classification of ""unnecessary."""
"I doubt anyone will be cosplaying as Snails anytime, soon."
A more apt title might have been: Jim Carrey's Series of Outlandish Impersonations.

"Everything, Everything is caught in a trap where it doesn't commit to fleshing out the implications of its premise but doesn't have the tools to survive without it."
the entire enterprise has fallen short of its muddled ambitions.
Everyone smiles far too much.
Another Tim Burton fairy tale. Adams and Waltz miscast. The screenplay is shallow and has no depth. The ham-fisted acting doesn't help.
"The filmmakers have photographed and arranged this raw material so that we are distanced, rather than brought into it."
"Imagine a film that features an endless cavalcade of people being eviscerated in the bloodiest and bone-snappiest of ways, yet which somehow manages to inspire the audience to envy the victims."

An unusual blend of investigative journalism and tacky artifice.

I don't know what to make of Act of Valor. It's like reviewing a recruiting poster.

...Quaid expressed more fear trying to calm his bucking horse in `The Alamo.'
The first 15 minutes of Vantage Point are the worst. Then you only have to sit through them seven more times.
No classic but far less offensive than the witless dross like See Spot Run that kids have endured on their time off.
THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN follows the tedious pattern of other recent boy-man movies: crude comedy leads to quaint romantic resolution.
"...largely silly, if well meaning, inoffensive but predictable, unoriginal, and bland."
...85 minutes of utterly banal people mouthing utterly banal dialogue...
Excellent at mimicking the shape and cadence of snappy dialogue without saying anything worth remembering&#46;
"Yes, Bang Rajan introduces Westerners to a slice of history worth noting, but its stirring lesson is told in a way that's too long, too brutal, and too clunky to recommend enthusiastically."
The movie's choppy MTV-style edits seem to be covering up a lack of focus in the characters' motivations.

"While the first film was, like ""Wicked,"" an alternate view of a classic good-versus-evil tale, its sequel is a one-note, moralistic sledgehammer with no payoff."
"As fluffy and innocuous as the first two acts are, the overlong and schmaltzy last thirty minutes become an endurance test."

"On the surface - and that's all there is - it seems as pointless and gassy as a ""Matrix"" sequel."
"Overall, your enjoyment of this film will correlate directly to your enjoyment of the previous film. If you liked it, you'll like this one, if not, you won't enjoy the sequel as it's just more of the same."
"It makes marriage look like the biggest mistake of all time, and the multiplex a prison from which there is no escape."
"What Eliza writes, like Motherhood itself, feels like a stale collection of harried-parent material that the bland comedy duo The Mommies milked dry more than a decade ago."
"Not only did I want to go to sleep the entire time, but I wouldn't watch this movie again if you told me my life depended on it."
Their cool-to-be-cruel stance is too hip for the room and a likely turnoff for preteen girls who don't like fluff balls laced with bile.

"Like so much adolescent, made-for-guys comedy-horror, Piranha 3DD is so weirdly uptight about women you figure exhibitors should hand out teen health guides as well as 3-D glasses."
"It's a promising subject for a film, but Before the Fall examines it in a disappointingly rote way."
"Empty people leading lonely lives - if there was some character growth this might be more compelling, but without that, the movie seems a bit empty as well."
"Everybody vamps and preens as if it were amateur night in SoHo, and a few of the performers, such as Kate Hudson, appear ill-used."

"By the end of ""Abduction,"" it's even becoming difficult for supporting actors like Sigourney Weaver and Alfred Molina to keep from laughing at the lunacy unfolding."
"Amy Adams, spunky and incandescent as Amelia Earhart, is so fun to watch that she almost makes up for the dopeyness surrounding her."
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford represents a breakthrough in the moviegoing experience. It may be the first time we've been asked to watch a book on tape.
Consider yourself warned.
The film fails in being unable to provoke suspense amid the intrigue. [Full Review in Spanish]
It's just a bit too uneven to take advantage of its strengths.
(T)wo hours of watching head shots of two men buried and immobile in rubble?
Did you ever get the feeling that Brian DePalma designs entire films around set pieces he thinks would be really cool?
"The uneasy mix of the real and the imaginary, the trying to inject drama, and the swelling background music, renders the film less effective than it could have been, despite its inspiring subject, and its fine actors."
"To the extent that ""JFK Revisited: Through the Looking Glass"" has a reason to exist, it's to make space for Stone's JFK crusading in a contemporary political sphere that's much more receptive to conspiracy theory."
Dull characters and dry storytelling are to blame here.
"At a certain point lofty objectivity is just a refusal to engage, and no raw camera work can disguise it."
"Pine is never going to successfully pull off weight-of-the-world anxiety: His expression in Shadow Recruit's first moments, set on 9/11, might be called ""aggrieved puppy."""
"True, it's not at all the movie I would have expected from Stern, but a little warmth and a structure borrowed from Annie Hall do not a modern classic make."
"There is comfort in familiarity, which is why having original cast members back together... is a definite asset,"
"Washington and Pattinson have palpable charisma, but this cold puzzle offers no incentive to solve it. Throw in damsel-in-distress crap, and both my geek sensibilities and my feminism are offended."
"Instead of inspiring his audience, Parker's desperation to achieve greatness proves transparent, while the quality of filmmaking does not equal his ambitions."
Part of the problem with &quot;Evolution&quot; -- aside from the fact that it isn&apos;t really very funny -- is that it&apos;s mostly jaded&#59; there&apos;s very little gee-whiz&#44; almost no awe&#46;
"Why is the film so damned anodyne? It's another glossy $200 million studio bland out. Thanks for that, Hollywood."
"If they're expendable, why won't they die?"
"This Kong is an imposing monster, to be sure, but as an innocent caught up in the dealings of the inhabitants of a world beyond his comprehension, he doesn't quite register."
"While Simmba is an ode to Bollywood's 'masala' genre, what it gets wrong is the way in which the film tries to manipulate its viewers."
"The film is unwieldy, a brash regurgitation of cinematic and narrative styles with a regressive heart."
Unfortunately&#44; the ominous atmosphere built up in this ultra-slim 71-minute psychodrama&#8217;s earlier moments dissipates into predictability&#46;
Leaves one feeling empty.
The interest in its character contrasts is somewhere below the level of gripping and a major failure is the outcome for the sake of an ambiguously happy ending.
A plodding and uninteresting revenge thriller.
Brain bleeding miscasting.
What's missing is a sense of who the dancers are as people and it makes La Danse feel like it has missed some crucial steps.
"Isn't just wireless--it's also brainless and virtually suspense-less...a chain of recycled cliches. As Barbara Stanwyck might have said, 'Sorry, Wrong Number.'"
"'The Unholy' loses itself in a horror approach better suited for trailers than sustained feature tension, as blasphemy becomes less and less scary with such basic execution."
"Friends with Money is not a finished portrait, just a disposable snapshot of people we're less than invested in."
Not even Emma Thompson can breathe life into this middlebrow look at Victorian rigidities.
"For me anyway, it just seemed to disappear."
"""This will be a game night to remember,"" intones a character, early on in the film; this isn't true, as I've already forgotten most of this movie despite having taken notes."
"Moore models some slinky lingerie and Douglas soaks his collars in sweat, while the emphasis on computer gizmos and cyber-babble encourages a verdict of virtual rubbish."
"Wish Upon isn't just a tired horror retread, it's been tranquilized and sleepwalks through every lame development"
"While Saldana gives her very best in trying to embody the essence of Miss Simone with equal support from co-star David Oyelowo, both are confined to a weak script and for Saldana, probably the worst makeup job she's had on the big screen."
There is so much plodding sensitivity.
The Fountain is the story of a gifted artist who dared to reach for the stars and paid for his ambition with a really stupid movie.

"Despite a talented cast, the film's promising premise - old-school parenting vs. new-school kids - is mishandled."
"The spectacle is marvelous, but it isn't really enough to sustain it for nearly three hours. For a haul like that, you need an interior, as well as an exterior, and The Last Emperor doesn't have enough inner life. "
"I empathized with Foxx's plight: Collateral dragged me on a long, violent ride in the dark to nowhere."
"What's disappointing about Anonymous is that it isn't dumb enough. Rather than plunging merrily ahead with its fanciful counternarrative, the movie keeps stopping to actually, seriously make its case -- to posit and explain and persuade."
"Lara, at least, appears to know who she is. Now, if only her movies did her justice."
"[A] film too absurd to take seriously, but too strange to ignore."
"People answer in punchlines here, and leave it to director Reitman to always lead with irony."
Vaughn's Norman Bates is much inferior because he lacks the natural neurosis of Anthony Perkins.
"""The Darkest Minds"" plays like a Saturday morning kids' show, complete with TV-level production values, shoddy special effects and Mandy Moore (NBC's 'This Is Us')."

"There's something with potential here, but the movie decides, like Lavinia, to go the conservative route."
"It's all quite implausible and the mindless, contrived ending is infuriating."
"Um filme que Joey, personagem de LeBlanc em Friends, certamente poderia ter protagonizado."
Jesse Eisenberg's performance reminded me of his character in Rio... Just replace the bird with a live-action human and add infinitely more gore.
"An uneven, convoluted, certainly dispute-provoking study of sexual passion in which Marlon Brando gives a truly remarkable performance."
"Thanks to an earnest performance by James Gandolfini anchoring it, we can almost forget the weight of Kristen Stewart dragging it down with every hair flip and tug."
"The [Wachowskis] have ""borrowed"" bits from here, there, and everywhere, and they have ended up creating a two hour and fifteen minute jumble of cultural and philosophical references with violence to spare, but precious little clarity or logic."
There's no guiding power at work here; it's Evolution without a shred of intelligent design.
a commercial ripoff designed to confuse art-house patrons
"From the premise to the sets to the performances, everything about this lively comic fable is dead predictable."
"Sex comedies often glean laughs out of sexual humiliation, but when the laughs don't come -- and The Oh In Ohio is devoid of even the mildest chuckles -- all that's left is the humiliation."
"There isn't a shot, scene or sequence in The Rock that doesn't move furiously, typically with colored lights flashing into our faces or onto those of the actors."
The cold shower of swinger documentaries.
"Not appreciably better than a mid-level Masterpiece Theatre episode...surprisingly starchy, stilted and clichéd."
"Kate Winslet does a syrupy voice-over to this bedtime story, but given what we know of foxes, it's a tough one to swallow."
"The art of Storytelling too often degenerates into a rant, losing its very own hard-bought truth."
"Even by the franchise's own declining standards, Fockers is a wince-a-thon of crude gag sausage-making."
Even the funniest 40 percent of Scary has that not-so-fresh feeling.
The high quality of [Moll's] actors does not relieve the story from seeming ambitiously fudge-brained.
"Mr. Affleck handles the busy narrative without finding its hook, but his biggest problem is that he's fallen for his leading man."
"Although ambitious in its lyrical presentation, filmmaker Joe Wright's The Soloist plays a stale tune of cliched melancholy musical chairs."
"Costner still exhibits that old spark in places but somehow, he never breathes much life into his traditional interpretation. And this western is so traditional, it's practically corseted."
A tense psychological chiller that ratchets up the tension before collapsing with a predictable finale.
A puzzle of exposition and an assortment of ... questions ... overwhelm and distract us from the nightmarish scenario.
I kept holding out hope it would reveal itself as a parody in the 11th hour.
[It] would deserve credit for being more thematically ambitious than the average animated film if it incorporated those themes with any aplomb.
"Sadly, whilst Ouija: Origin of Evil has a couple of interesting moments, overall it's a messy disappointment."
"Maximum Crap. It sorta revived AC/DC, if that matters."
There's so much judgemental snark that scriptwriters Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof come across no better than the trolls they're making fun of.
"Prefers easy sentiment over anything more than the most obvious of themes and the simplest, flimsiest of narratives."
Every minute that The Jesus isn't in a bowling alley Turturro and his movie lose a lot of what made him stand out.
"Calculated to outrage and executed to underwhelm, Kevin Smith's Red State is like a dull blade slashing wildly, predictably and ineffectually at its target."
"A zero, but the title describes how the audience is likely to react, perfectly."
"Everything Platoon has to say is right there on the surface, like a tattoo: ""War is hell."" There are no layers to suss out. There is nothing to ponder."
"A Futile and Stupid Gesture feels like a quick tour of a man's greatest hits that relies on his accomplishments, rather than any storytelling artistry, to impress the audience."
"The gossamer-thin plot is more flimsy than some of the characters' dresses and at 146 minutes, the sequel overstays its welcome by the best part of an hour."
"I am confounded how ""It"" built so brilliantly on anticipation and fear, but the sequel opts to rely on so many cheap jump scares and telegraphed moments."
Sadly this is an average adaptation of a runaway best selling book&#46;

It's like if the movie Clue had been about watching the main characters play the board game Clue.
Into the Storm is another found footage failure - a gimmicky natural disaster film that fails to provide exciting tornado action or impactful human drama.

'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
"If you mashed-up the worst parts of the infamous Howard the Duck, Gigli, Ishtar and every other awful movie I've seen since I started reviewing professionally in 1981, it wouldn't begin to approach the sheer soul-sucking badness of [Movie 43]."
"The movie comes across as Sunday school meets Greenpeace meets Ace Ventura -- laughter, religion and environmentalism make strange bedfellows."
"Fiennes juggles too many elements, including a variety of childhood flashbacks and a tepid romantic fling with a Parisian socialite, which sometimes confuses, distracts and derails the film's inevitable arrival at its pièce de résistance."
"A smug, manic London comedy that feels as if it's come several years too late to the Richard Curtis party."
"Stone and the script shortchange the characters, forcing them to do things that seem phony and having them recite lines that sound stilted and overly didactic."
"The movie asks the audience to not look at two elephants in the room, and unfortunately, no amount of soaring music can relieve that heavy a burden."
"The Death Trials has all the entertainment of watching attractive young people run up and down MC Escher's steps while one of them cries a lot. The unofficial end of the entire YA adaptation era has seemingly arrived, and just like adulthood, it sucks."
"It's Bela. It's a classic. Unfortunately, it's also a dreadful little flick."
"As a cop-action flick this isn't bad, but it fits the mold so thoroughly that it feels more familiar than it should."
"Although the first 75 minutes of Don’t Worry Darling are passably entertaining, the final half-hour is so badly composed... that it destroys the meager goodwill generated by the earlier parts of the film. "
Geoffrey Rush chews so much scenery that he looks ready to burst.
It's Oscar-mongering of the most blunt and reprehensible sort.
"Hollywood slickness and the energy provided by the stars, Bryan Cranston and Kevin Hart, keep the show running smoothly, but even this basic quality is undersupplied."
Cage? Movie star as social studies teacher.
"Lugubrious, bumbling and sit-com predictable, Our Idiot Brother has a couple of good ideas, no style, an episodic structure and some charming incidental pleasures, not the least of which are the performances, which are good."
Some handsome location shooting in New Orleans doesn't make up for the Oscar winners' relentless hamming and a plot that twists way beyond credibility.
"Isn't sexy, funny, smart or fun."
"The Voices doesn't work as a comedy because it isn't funny, and it doesn't work as a thriller because it's not suspenseful, and it doesn't work as an exploration of schizophrenia, if that is what this is meant to be about, as it's not insightful."
"As it is, The Bag Man is always teetering on the edge of amateurish absurdity, before being tugged back from the edge by its actors."
"It is rather sad, therefore, that an interesting premise seems rather rushed and lacking storytelling skill despite some excellent central performances."
This version can lay claim to being another of King's works that's disastrous when put on the big screen.
A laughably written script which lacks the kind of menace and supplemental character development to make this anything more than camp dressed up in haute couture.

"During their ""getting to know you"" scene, Seth asks Vicky, ""Is everybody that predictable?"" As far as In Our Nature goes, it would seem so."
"Its grindingly earnest tone is that of the hasty posthumous tribute, rather than the more textured, inquiring long view of a worthwhile biopic."
"After its first episodic hour, I found myself struggling against a growing disappointment as I wondered if Audiard was going to take us anywhere particularly adventuresome or truly new."
"The Hangover isn't painful to watch. If friends drag you to this movie, you won't hate them afterwards. But maybe it'll seem a lot funnier if you are drinking."
"Not very exciting, but unexpected humor adds a couple of nice touches to this dysfunctional family/gender-bender/road trip movie."
"As a behind-the-scenes look at how a concert of this size and scope actually comes together, ""This Is It"" is undeniably intriguing but as a testament to the artistic talents of Michael Jackson, it comes up short in many areas."
"A beyond-lame satire, Teddy Bears' Picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing debuts by an esteemed writer-actor."
"I laughed during a few scenes, grinned during a few others -- and sat silently, unsmiling and mildly impatient, during at least two or three repetitious and interminable stretches."
The Last Shyamalan.
Kay Francis in a story about mother love which may make you wonder how anyone so well dressed could feel so terrible.
"What the movie gives us is Smith running and running and running with an unvarying expression of consternation, and Fuqua stringing together a B-movie behind the facade of prestige."
There's nothing here but a noisy and dumb piece of fluff that simply isn't trying hard enough.
"I wasn't scared, amused, or otherwise peripherally entertained in any way by Wish Upon."
"A slugglishly painful, uninteresting film that might be of value to New Testament students who don't like to read words unless they come with pictures."
"There are moments of genuine inspiration to be found, but such is the intent to tick every Christmas box the good is outweighed rather heavily by the bad."
"Characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses, no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license Avary employs."
Tangled and overblown.
"Despite the proficient technique, after a while you may feel you're watching a particularly scenic snuff film."

"The decision to double down on [Part II,/i>'s] too-clever-by-half meta deconstruction plays like a tactical retreat, an act of emotional disengagement from the heart of the material."
"Director Phil Traill and screenwriter Kim Barker should take some credit for attempting something original, but ultimately what they come up with is an ensemble cast of non-entities and the overriding feeling that they're exploiting the lead character."
"The sort of earnest, haphazardly constructed kidflick that offers nothing for the over-12 set and not much for little ones who've seen a few real movies in their young lives."
"The movie, with its badly painted backdrops, its stiff acting and its complete lack of dramatic momentum, is embarrassing to watch."
exactly what you'd expect from a spoof of found footage movies released in January without advanced screenings for critics
The whole movie is a thing I wish I hadn't heard or seen
"With ambitions greater than comedy and results that fall short of character study, The Big Year is neither fish nor fowl."

"A fabulous facsimile of a movie, a frosting without a cake."
"No matter how juicy the banter, the strings are always showing."
"Good for Shawn Levy for going outside of his comfort zone, but as much as he may dislike being typecast as a director, he should keep that 'mindless family movie' door open as long as he possibly can."
"'No!' is the first word spoken in There Will Be Blood, and it should be the last said in response to Paul Thomas Anderson's latest pretend epic."
To really enjoy this movie I think you have to have a small device implanted in your brain.
"Our Nixon shows that while the stooges were good at scheming (up until Watergate, at least) they sucked as filmmakers."
"Berg clearly has nothing but reverence for the armed forces, but that admiration renders him incapable of portraying anything dispassionately."
"The frank, level-headed tone of the documentary does not transform into the righteous anger that such financial corruption calls for."
"It's karaoke with a vengeance, the circle of the inferno that Dante could never in his wildest imaginings anticipate."
"By all appearances, this film feels like it's going to seize the reins of the old, Imagineering Disney mojo, but the story squanders that with a rehash of Burton's film - and by presenting Alice as selfish and annoyingly obstinate."
This may well be the dreariest and most monochromatic time you'll have at the movies all summer.
"""Heartbreaker"" has some amusing moments and gorgeous settings (the Riviera), but it never achieves the smooth slickness director Pascal Chaumeil aims for."
"When you feel like you have to explain the pop culture references in your gags, your movie is in trouble."
"Part historical fantasy, part lovers-separated-by-death weeper, part New Age fever dream, The Fountain isn't truly horrible, just very, very silly."
The performers... invest much more of themselves in the film than it ever returns to them.
You're fired.
A typically uneven effort from documentarian Michael Moore...
"Requiring substantial forgiveness of its numerous logical gaps, this slick yet derivative British heist thriller never manages to raise the emotional stakes."
"The abundant, generally on-target sociological details and comic observations feel overdone and superficial, like an elaborately patterned rug laid over an unfinished floor."
Suicide Squad is an exposition dump masquerading as a cinematic experience.
"If The Hangover gave you hope for Hollywood - yup, there is some creativity and boldness left - The Hangover Part II sinks it."
"The film is content to relentlessly scream ""Boo!"" behind the audience's back rather than provide any real thrills"
"As a subversive dissection of a genre, the film has no grit or imagination, and as a work of stock wham-bam entertainment, it's a sloppy trifle, merely the latest piece of disposable Friday night mainstream-cinema juvenilia."
"A dry and dreary little affair, one that's almost shamefully beholden to B-flicks that are a lot more energetic and a lot less intent on being taken so seriously."
It can't overcome the fact that Thornton never found a way to turn literary style into a compelling cinematic vision.
"Enduring Love is better in parts than as a whole. Ultimately, the film has too many jagged edges."
I lost interest in wanting to know more about the supernatural manifestations.
Rod Lurie accomplishes the impossible by churning out a flag-waving action yarn even more ham-fisted than Pearl Harbor.
There is not a scary scene in the whole movie.
"There's a forced sprightliness, here, that reminds me too much of how people get at the end of a party -- you know, when they've stopped having fun but can't quite muster the will to leave or clean up the trash and vomit."
"Watching this film feels like listening to a formerly great pianist whose fingers are now gnarled with arthritis. The notes are right, and played in the correct order, but the tempo is way, way off."

"In any event, The Wolfman makes a satisfactory date movie for Valentine's Day, which is more than can be said for Valentine's Day."
"From concept to execution to tone, writer-director Liz W. Garcia's The Lifeguard is a lifeless misfire."
The ill-advised mansion purchase is just the first in an endless series of blunders in this half-baked thriller.
"Hunter S. Thompson hated phonies; in a lot of ways, The Rum Diary is one."
"Lazy directing on the behalf of Oliver Stone, the miscasting of Shia LaBeouf and an often incomprehensible plot turn this film into a total mess."
Here we go again with the grief&#46; Not every survival movie needs to be a therapy session&#46;

The film loses its way when it tries to impart something close to wisdom -- who are we kidding here?
... A thoroughly predictable saga that never quite engages the audience like it should.

"""Sanctum"" is a soggy mess of a movie."
"A good horror movie can make even the most well-worn plot devices seem new again, but The Rental never rises above its basic storyline. Dave Franco has done some good stuff as an actor, but his debut feature film barely leaves a mark."

Sitting through My Boss' Daughter is the enactment of a critic's worst nightmare.
"This been-there-mauled-that monster movie gets points for being loud and rather bloody, but it still hasn't found a way to make werewolves interesting."
I had mixed feelings about this movie. I actually kind of really liked this movie for the first 80 percent of it and then the ending just really ruined it for me.
"I laughed a couple of times, but mostly I was bored out of my mind and not a little depressed."
Proof of Life refers to a negotiator's demand for proof a hostage is still alive...you may start wondering the same thing about the movie.
"A curious film that has a few fine moments and builds up to an interesting crescendo, but the plot is patchy with many things unexplained, leaving us indifferent"
The Great Emancipator becomes a pretty great decapitator in this ridiculous and entertaining but ultimately exhausting mashup of 19th century American history and 21st century pop trendiness.
"This is the kind of long, dull Winter that makes you wish summer would get here right away, bringing with it the comforting prospect of getting to watch a car blow up or something. Anything."
"Had passersby been listening through the theater door at the advance screening I attended, they might very well have assumed the audience was watching a comedy rather than the trite, overwrought drama it actually tries to be."
"There are heart-tugging moments in The Glass Castle, but Walls's bestselling memoir needed to be roughed up and aired out. For it to match up to the book, the movie needed the glass to be smashed, not every shard treasured."
"Endless video-game-style, violent mayhem is on display in this latest edition of the mind-numbing apocalypse series."
Exposure to 'Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip' may result in the dislocation of eyeballs in viewers over the age of 7 due to uncontrollable rolling of the eyes at the sight of the idiotic antics committed on screen.
"If you like Maxim, you will love The Island."
Staggeringly overrated.
"A sad example of Hollywood at its weakest and a reminder that even today's pabulum, spoon-fed as it is in multiplexes, is rarely as bad as the early roaring 1990s."
"An atrocious motion picture...makes The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert look like The Remains of the Day."
"Gyllenhaal, who clearly relished getting into tip-top shape (he's ripped and shirtless throughout) for the project, gives it his thespian all, even as the plot gets tied up in the ropes of the old, the tired and the predictable."
May satisfy fans of the earlier films ... but it won't win any new converts.
"It's affectionately done, but rather pointless."
"Mortensen should certainly do another western, soon. Preferably he should do one with a real sense of danger to go along with all the neat, tidy, highfalutin' honor and decency."
"Visually, the picture is all of a piece, but it's a self-conscious piece of work -- all dark-toned academic classicism."
"Perhaps a more imaginative director might have brought some genuine feeling or grace to this bathos, but Barnz merely allows Aniston maximum screen time and shoots her to highlight her artfully ratty hair and crosshatched skin."
"With a cast like this you keep waiting for something important to happen, which never does."
As precious as its prepubescent protagonist is precocious.
"The prickly warmth, specificity, and gallows humour that is Lonergan's stock in trade is gradually diluted by the generic mechanics of an important prestige picture."
"The film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes, Southern California locations and star power."
A weirdly inconsistent movie enjoyable only in fits and starts; but the fits are pretty spectacular.
"A schizophrenic hodgepodge of coming-of-age sincerity and watered down Farrelly brothers antics, the movie is endearingly sweet-natured even as it gasps for air."

Another one of those movies where a demented fiend devotes an extraordinary amount of energy to setting up scenes for the camera.
"While I would never claim that The Sitter was the worst film I saw in 2011, I think it is the film that most bitterly disappointed me this year."
"Sadly, there is not a single substantial thing we can take away from all of this in the end."
"The films are critic-proof, of course, and mockery-proof in the bargain. F9 makes a mockery of itself before anyone else can -- it's a gleefully shoddy goof on a pseudo-epic scale."
Comes across as an all-too-strenuous cash grab for the earlier film's mega-success.
"If you're a fan of the heist genre, it doesn't hurt to give this a try. If not, skip it."
"Though ambitiously busy, the film is also self-sabotaging and stagnant, showcasing its main character's struggles without interpreting them into a cohesive thesis."
Never manages to feel like a sustained story.
"Without the clarity of story, we begin to lose connection with the martial action, and it starts to seem repetitive."
"The flood of silly jokes will either make you laugh or they won't, but at least Zucker enlists the services of several veterans of this kind of nonsense."
Von Trier takes a dark&#44; uncomfortable&#44; and pointedly unsexy journey into the lows of her sexuality&#44; and the result contains everything an audience expects from a von Trier film by way of strong performances&#44; confronting subject matter&#44; and uneven results&#46;
"The premise of teaming up famous, disparate characters of classic fiction is a lot more intriguing than what ended up as the finished cinematic product."
They've taken the fun out of Candyman.

"[Jeuenet] doesn't push it all the way to ""so bad it's good"" territory, but he at least gives a healthy dose of the bizarre that makes it memorable, in its fashion."
Somehow both bland and over the top.
"Sadly, there's no wit here. Once Rip Torn's Louis XV has departed the scene, you can't find an actor able to deliver a line without sounding embarrassed about having to mean it."
"a mythically inspired, goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own"
"This film may shed significant insight into zoological conservation efforts, but there is never any question of which institutions benefit the most from its version of history."
Brick Mansions undermines its best asset -- the athletically impressive parkour sequences -- with overedited footage that would make a Jason Bourne movie look lethargic.
...[McCarthy] goes for it Bugs-Bunny-meets-the-Roadrunner-meets-all-three-Stooges-style. It's just that the movie she's single-handedly trying to save isn't worth her effort.
Filmmakers are working its way down to the very bottom of the toy box with Playmobil: The Movie.
The pretense of ambiguity and complexity turns out to be a tease.
Kirstie Alley and Tim Allen are shallow New York socialites on the verge of divorce who become tax-fraud fugitives and pretend to be simple Amish folk. Eva Gabor and Eddie Albert they're not.
And why would Daniel Radcliffe a.k.a. Harry Potter agree to star in such a dreary slog? The answer's obvious: Voldemort made him do it.
"Jackson's stretched-out adaptation gives off a militaristic bombast. Additionally, what was cuddly on the page is creepy and menacing onscreen."
"Despite the quality of the performances and the unique time period, the film is diminished by its indecisive tone and is difficult to recommend."
"This is a bad film, as simple as that. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Despite a fairly spectacular climax, the material's generic limitations eventually catch up with the plot."
Jackson has come back to Middle Earth to compose his most masturbatory effort yet.
"""Crimson Gold"" works better when we don't look at Hussein at all, but look at Tehran through his eyes."
"Although cloak-and-dagger fans might be intrigued by the foggy atmosphere, ""Closed Circuit's"" conspiracy theories are mostly suspect."
"This good-looking sci-fi thriller has some fun set designs, but it also has a big ""been there, done that"" quality."
"Another macho celebration of fighting for ""freedom"" because someone else told you to, devoid of any acknowledgement of the inherent irony of that ideology."
[A] professionally executed yet bloodless film ... an act of homage that hews reverently to its source material while missing the essential spirit and vitality that once powered it.
"Donnybrook has trouble finding its footing, coming off as derivative of superior films."
"In both the writing and cutting, it does not achieve the kind of dramatic unity that transports you. You end up simply admiring this bit or that, this performance or that."
What this thing turns out to be is a skimpy action flick&#46;
"..like an unloved, re-gifted fruitcake, it keeps on returning to multiplexes."
A sprawling epic that truly sprawls.
"Instead of taking a deep dive into the realm of what feminism can mean to different generations of younger women, the tacky screenplay of ""Misbehavior"" holds it back from becoming truly empowering."
"Its messages are innocuous and may hold the attention of the littlest viewers, but older audience members may find themselves repulsed by their nostalgia."
"Essentially The Virgin Suicides-lite, How to Deal unravels like pages from a self-flagellating tween girl's diary."
The thing about withholding plot information is that you must generally divulge that which you've held back at some point. [Rockefeller] never does.
"So many choices... just seem halfhearted. They're not terrible, but they're also not interesting."
"Efron seems to be on autopilot just going through the motions. His charismatic good looks will mesmerize the audience into believing he can act. Besides a priceless smile and a few nifty dance steps, he excels at dribbling and twirling a basketball."
"None of the trickery on display here ... can undo or lift the frustrating predictability, strangeness, and silliness of this particular venture."
"What ultimately derails “The Starling,” other than a pretty insufferable easy listening soundtrack, is its “big moment” overkill."
Why does the most evil spirit in the house look like Marilyn Manson in a nun's costume?
"The film may leave you wondering what purpose this franchise serves if not to give expression to Michael Bay's nationalist, racist, and misogynistic instincts."
Manages to be expertly ghoulish and exceptionally dumb at the same time. Even your goosebumps will feel a bit stupid before the end.
"Occasionally loud and offensive, but more often, it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma."
This is a lethargic A-list remake of an ingenious Oscar-winning Argentine thriller from 2009 called The Secret in Their Eyes. I'm not sure why they dropped the definite article.
"If The Rock weren't such a fundamentally genial screen presence, this short, stripped-down revenge drama might leave a sour aftertaste."
"Ten years ago, Chung's animated Aeon Flux was groundbreaking, inspirational. It still is. Maybe another spin through Chung's Flux DVD set will wipe away all memory of its middling live-action cousin."
"I waited the whole movie for a big twist that would make it all worthwhile, and let's just say I was extremely underwhelmed. John Lee Hancock wastes three Oscar winners."
"There is no story, no motor, and given the nature of the premise, nothing much can happen."
[Ivins'] voice comes through strongly ... which is the best that can be said of this otherwise pedestrian documentary.
...so overstuffed with heavy themes and convoluted plot lines that it barely manages to squeeze in the requisite gags about canine flatulence.
An overly familiar collage of bombastic bewilderment.

The director has a brilliant eye. But she fails to get behind the eyes of her heroine.
"A family film that feels more like it is going through the motions, basically giving fans of the original more of the same."
"A strange, sprained, but sprightly fusion of The Usual Suspects and the Tragic Mulatto, Slow Burn wants badly to turn its standard neo-noir into a nuanced racial chiaroscuro."
"... with a premise this ingenious, one wishes Downsizing as a whole was too."
"Basically, what we have here is a stranded-animal movie in which the stranded animals are forced to split screen time with a mopey human character and his annoying, redundant friends."
"""Homegrown"" provides more of a contact high than the real thing."
"It's simultaneously aesthetically impressive and astoundingly unappealing, shockingly straight-forward and hopelessly convoluted."
"Mostly, Not Easily Broken is a pat portrayal of a marriage, neither overly dull nor especially engaging."
"This is a movie that celebrates the sociopath, and the truly annoying couple at its center unfortunately offsets its moments of genuine charm."
"This admirable misfire is often endearing and Chappie is creatively designed and feels real, but an unsophisticated approach to its subject matter combined with the slight characterisations edges it perilously close to the scrapheap."
Nobody works harder at getting a laugh than Kevin Hart. It's exhausting to watch.
Not nearly the subversive deconstruction that Lifetime probably hoped for when they hired Franco in the first place.
Robert Rodriguez's 3-D computer-aided kid flick bytes off more than it can chew.
The implication that an audience's emotions should be wrenched out rather than coaxed out is as arrogant as 'Midsommar' is self-indulgent.
The tacky and loose means by which the platitudinous screenplay dances around what ails the story's football players is just one cog in a whirligig of pat representations.
Despite my own dislike for the final product that &apos;Creed III&apos; is&#46;&#46;&#46;the film delivers on the cinematic components that audiences not only crave&#44; but demand now more than ever from a blockbuster film like this&#46; 
"It's all predictable yet comfy. If you're looking for lighthearted entertainment, you'll find it here."
Grotesquely phony and manipulative ...
"It's not a tragedy of form in any way, but Peterloo is a miscalculation of narrative and intent."
"In trying to be a statement, rather than a film, it's managed to be very little of either."
"tries to juggle too many characters and purposes throughout its long running time... Blood Diamond works on many levels, although it doesn't do so consistently"
"The pacing by director del Toro is so slow that by the time a ghost does show up, it's more apt to wake the audience than scare them."
It's cable-riffic!
"Ophelia may provide solid filmmaking behind the camera and interesting viewpoints on its female characters but the stolid drama, convoluted storytelling, problematic script and the haphazard look on gender politics make it a disappointment."
"Imagine a movie where every character is played by Gary Oldman, in the drunken overacting Oldman mode. Oldman's unfocused and self-indulgent directorial debut has moments of poignancy and insight, but not enough to make it endurable."
"The plot is fairly simplistic, but it's overcomplicated with extra characters and nonstop action chaos."
"What happens afterwards, in Refn and the late Hubert Selby, Jr.'s can't-resist-obscurity-and-ambiguity screenplay will disappoint most filmgoers."
"Where Bonnie and Clyde is gloriously tragic, The Highwaymen is blunt and anti-climactically savage, fulfilling as well as somewhat critiquing former Texas Ranger Frank Hamer's bloodlust."
"It's very undemanding, though the enthusiastic granny bashing does provide a quantum of solace."
"This is Guy Ritchie's third turkey in a row, after Swept Away and Revolver. It is a pitiful attempt to recapture the success of his first two movies, Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch."
"In the very first shot, two deliriously happy young lovebirds -- Leo (Channing Tatum) and Paige (Rachel McAdams) -- exit a movie theater. Don't give us any ideas."
"The hot-button thriller isn't as divisive, or satirically sharp, as you were told."
"Click is perfectly watchable, sometimes funny, and occasionally even touching. But it will be better when you can see it on DVD and fast-forward through all the crummy stuff."
"Beresford and his screenwriter, Marilyn Levy, have a wealth of compelling material at their disposal. But somehow the film doesn't quite cohere."
"Inspired by fantasy video games, Alpha Rift is so shoddily made, it makes the most primitive video games from the 1980s look like masterpieces in comparison. What an embarrassing, amateur-looking mess."
"Sadly, the story is nowhere as original as the details and performances."
"Like Refn's one-dimensional women, this movie thinks it's profound when it's really just drop-dead gorgeous."
"Country-fried family drama, a resonant slice of rural Americana, filled with sociopathic characters in search of a story."
We don't need to see white characters feeling guilty or oppressed to understand that the verbal and emotional abuse committed against 'the help' is wrong.
"This time, it's the audience that gets... TAKEN."
"The Protégé sucks the fun and excitement out of its action-thriller premise, and it turns its gorgeous, incredible actors into charisma black holes. Everyone involved not only deserves better, but has done better versions of what they do here."
An almost brutally manipulative piece...can't stand up against the tidal wave of treacle that swells up and swallows everyone in the final reels.
"Now, if you can just stay sane until the actual slasher portion of the flick takes off, you might be okay."
One of those projects whose very existence should baffle anyone hardy enough to endure all 94 minutes.
It's a weird horror hybrid that doesn't say anything unique or thought provoking about the field [director Dan] Gilroy is attempting to satirize.
"This talented and, at 32, very young director must now find new ideas -- maybe working with someone else's scripts. Because his film-making identity is in danger of fading."
"The jokes fizzle out, the fun dries up and the Ocean’s Eleven gags fall short. It’s a real shame, because that intro is dynamite. A crushing defeat snatched from the jaws of victory."
At times it's almost like Pacino has been lured into a Bobby Bowfinger production except the best blackmail material around to get his permission for release is 88 Minutes itself.
"Some of the film is so incredibly stupid, it's funny."
"To address the economic inequality of teeming Sao Paulo, Brazil, documentary maker Jason Kohn has joined several loosely related topics into a sort of rhetorical doughnut, leaving a hole in the center where his thesis should be."
Take out all the elements of The Big Chill that made you like that film and keep the ones that annoyed you and you've got The Wedding Weekend.
If you can stomach its anti-science beliefs there's a slight chance you might even like this sort of undemanding nonsense.
"I can see how the hardcore Halloween-heads can find some small nuggets of fun in this particular sequel, but in my eyes the series ended with the explosion in Halloween 2."
"What would have been interesting, perhaps, would have been to have truly explored the cultural differences and their impact on growing up and parenting."
"A clunky, dull effort that lacks any measure of excitement or thrills, desperately leaving you wanting more and wishing its talented filmmakers could have done more with such an intriguing premise."
Robert Zemeckis' infatuation with the motion-capture animation process has officially gone too far...
"Caine's geriatric slasher may have gripes against UK youngsters with bad behavior. But the 'don't trust anyone under thirty' carnage, is really not the role model example that the elders should be setting, by killing 'em all and sorting 'em out later."
"A meandering story packed with corny moments, mostly dull acting and a star who, hype aside, shares only an accent with fellow Australian Russell Crowe."
"There are two reasons to see ""Rock of Ages."" One: If you live and breathe for 80s rock music. Two: A drugged up Tom Cruise belting out Bon Jovi. Unfortunately, that's about it."
"Despite significant cuts and instances of condensation, the plot's skeleton tracks well with Sebold's book, but therein lies the roots of a problem: the movie features wild swings in tone and fails to draw the viewer into the story."
The script doesn't earn the C average students must maintain for continued enrollment in their performing arts school.
"They call this the ""squeakquel"" and that's about all you'll want to know about a film that remorselessly pulls all the levers of the first highly successful box-office attraction."
"It's disposable fluff that small children might enjoy, but everyone else will be bored long before the closing credits arrive."
A 90-minute confessathon minus the bleeped-out cuss words and pixelated breasts.
...a sporadically amusing yet hopelessly uneven endeavor that simply isn't in the same league as Hughes' later classics.
"Stylishly shot in black-and-white, well-acted, and unflinchingly grim, but it's exhausting, overlong, and ultimately underwhelming."
Like many big weddings - a lot of things go wrong and not much goes right.
"The movie might have a point (hey, Environmental Protection Agency, do something!), but it has no dramatic structure or sense of suspense."
"Although entirely watchable, this remake of the Disney classic lacks an interesting secondary storyline, is derived of almost all charisma and charm that made the original what it is today and is plagued with wooden performances and poor CGI."
"With an exploitation-friendly title like Machine Gun Preacher you'd think this movie would be the soul brother of Hobo With A Shotgun. Unfortunately, that is not so."
"Letting things slide into a sort of low-calorie moral vacuum, Mackenzie hasn't so much nailed LA's culture of skin-deep gratification as produced an advert for it."
"The final apocalyptic fistfight between Cattaleya and Marco is shot in kinetic jerky fast forward, presumably because the director was worried the clock would run out."
"The whole film comes off as an unfunny, nightmarish anti-feminist version of The Taming of the Shrew."
"""Bloodthirsty"" never becomes the savage music industry satire it could be. But its music leaves a lasting impression that is tough to wipe away."
"Evidently, these young FBI geniuses were just on a collective undercover assignment to infiltrate the Melrose Avenue club scene, because their disguise consists of half-grown (or half-ungrown) beards, shaggy hair, [and] insouciant wisecracking attitudes."
"It would be easier to recommend it if only, like its characters, it didn't drift quite so easily, aimlessly knocked about by the tide."
"If you're going to base a movie on a song, why not choose a song that's, y'know, about something?"
"...a drab, dark, slow movie with absolutely no chemistry between or among any of the players...the color so washed out that it might as well have been in black & white."
An execrable and witless nonstarter that makes a potent case for hanging the Cinderella myth out to dry till the end of time.
The best part comes right off the top as Juliet Wright sings and dances up a storm during the opening credits.
"Bottle Shock comes on too strong and sours once the cork is popped, despite a delightfully over-the-top showing by Alan Rickman."
''Hook'' never sets sail.
Isn't as strong as Dodgeball or Starsky and Hutch primarily because the satire inherent in these flicks isn't paid as much attention to this time around.
Cluttered and awkward.
Stylish lighthearted comical heist drama of stealing a priceless diamond and emerald-studded dagger from Turkey's world-famous Topkapi Museum.
"I'm not saying the third act is quite as crazily stupid as 'The Cobbler,' but it's recognizably the work of the same writer."
...it's hard now to see what all the fuss was about.
"A shame that Stealing Harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating, boring, and forgettable."

"Yup, it really is THAT bad. Hilariously bad, even."
"This hugely elaborate production is supposed to be the reboot of a foundering franchise, but rebooting a computer wipes the silicon slate clean. In the movie, what's old is old again."
"May be gorgeous to look at, butthe film fails to capture how awe-inspiringsomething as epic as a trip to the moonmust have been."
"It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel bored."

"Saddled with as thin a premise as one could envision, Lifeboat ultimately comes off as a disappointing endeavor that boasts few elements designed to capture and sustain the viewer's interest..."
"Fuglsig's feature debut is ultimately less an action movie and more a procedural, one in which incremental gains and minimal casualties are as much as can be hoped for."
"Once you recognize that each new development is nothing more than a prelude to another con, any sense of tension is moot."
"Wolf attempts to put the idealism behind the idea and the reality of the execution on equal footing, but the end result is a sense of dissonance."
the most boring version of the Rapture I could have ever imagined

"Director Chris Wedge falls into the common animator's trap of making the ""human"" characters a lot duller than the nonhuman creepy-crawlies."

"There are a million moments in which to contemplate your own demise while watching the smug self-indulgence and cheap, overelaborated non-comedy of this vanity project."

The Witches feels like a paycheck movie from a man who used to spend fortunes doing whatever he wanted.
One had hoped for better.
"There is a moment in the third act where Eva calls Sando's old wise man shtick ""guru shit"", and it would be amusingly self-observant if the screenplay wasn't fully committed to embracing two hours' worth of that very new-age nonsense."
It's extremely easy to split the film into its bad part and its good part.
With an above average number of jump scenes but only a few scant moments that are truly scary.
"Warm Bodies has such a sweet and quirky spirit that it's a shame the movie isn't better. Unfortunately, Jonathan Levine fails to sustain the story's premise and the narrative pace gets stuck at a zombie shuffle."
The Protégé is not a terrible film. At worst it's just a waste of your time.
It's a bad thriller and a bad comedy!
"A giant shark dud. Hilariously bad. I actually enjoyed this movie because it was so horrible. The painful moments of Jason Statham (and I LOVE Statham) and the lead actress were uncomfortable, and I really cared less if anyone got eaten."
"The film seems too content to color completely within the lines. The resulting picture might be enough of a diversion for younger kids, but even they won't be missing much if what's in the movie stays secret."
A film which has the occasional interesting scene but which fails to ever take off.
"Murder on the Orient Express drags, which is good if you need a nap, but not so good if you seek excitement and mystery."

"Tropic Thunder, full of punchlines about Milli Vanilli and Being There, stitches the tired cultural references of one generation to the utterly debased expectations of their heirs."
"stale, indifferent, and recycled."
Most of its running time is taken with mollifying conversations between Mack and the movie's New Age-meets-Bible Belt oversimplifications of the Holy Trinity. It fits right into a long tradition of quasi-mystical pseudo-parables.
Helen Reddy was surely a more interesting figure than this well-intentioned but hollow biopic ever gets her credit for.
"Deadly serious, almost funereal...a pretentious, dreary film, which is also frustratingly unenlightening."
"A Sino-Aussie thriller with plenty of properly potent action beats, a generally engaging cast, a global chase involving wildly improbable escapes and a script rife with knee-slappingly silly plot details."
No chemistry between Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson
"Yes, the technology makes his face look less lined, a sophisticated computer version of what Hollywood used to do for aging actresses playing younger than their true age. But a 76-year-old with an unlined face still cannot pass for a 26-year-old."
"Nothing about these characters, their relationships with one another, or the world they inhabit feels authentic."
Simply more of the same gritty superhero nonsense that appeals to depressed 15-year-old boys&#46; And it&apos;s not done all that well&#44; either&#46;

"The animation in The Good Dinosaur is stunningly beautiful. Photo-realistic, even. And yet, the story is so basic, so immature, and so disjointed that the visuals are in service of a dud of a plot."
"True crime procedurals can have a certain fascination, but not when they're jumbled glimpses of what might or might not have happened involving a lot of empty people whose main claim to fame is that they're dead."
"Smartly cast and with a sharp team behind the scenes, there is no good reason why ""Dredd 3D"" is such a clunk-headed action picture."
"Entertaining at first, but falls apart once its secret is revealed."
"Most of this talky film just feels like a debate between two experts, trying to answer a question few of us had asked. When the real question is, Where's David Cronenberg?"
"[It] has its moments, but slammed together into one feature, they feel like they're fighting for dominance from one scene to the next, resulting in a film that, for all the work that's clearly gone into it, just doesn't seem to know what it wants to say."
He claims here to have been influenced early on by Snow White. I should have thought Peter Pan instead.
"The producers may be right to bemoan Hollywood's myopia; but it's the movie's execution, not its vision of an alternative African-American cinema, that delayed its release."
"It's just another in the string of subpar exorcism movies which followed 1973's never-rivalled The Exorcist, gussied up with an A-list cast and dishonest marketing."
A hyperventilating account of the blood-drenched Miami drug culture in the 1970s and 80s.
Transamerica is To Wong Foo but with a pre-op tranny protagonist and a strained parent-child dynamic.
&#91;Its&#93; refusal to actually engage with the action as more than &quot;corner-of-the-eye&quot; periphery prevented me from investing in any of the so-called stakes&#46; Because if the kids don&apos;t seemed scared&#44; why should I&#63;
There's no cliche left unturned except the heartbroken heroine gorging on a carton of ice cream.
"Personally, thanks to that stupid turn of climactic events I think it's at best okay, and not even a three dimensional pickaxe to the jugular is going to get me to say otherwise."
A near-constant flow of clichs.
Both a solemn search for a dead child and a violent race riot are scored with celestial keyboard washes and choral harmonies intended to imbue the scenes with Significance.
Director Stewart Raffill's film is otherwise an unashamed rip-off of Spielberg's classic.
"If distracting the audience from the movie's ingrained blunders is what he's[Kitano] trying to accomplish, it doesn't work."
Nope is Peele&apos;s most ambitious and weakest body of work yet&#46; Nope starts as an intriguing and thrilling adventure but quickly becomes a narratively dense mess&#46;
"It's obvious that the filmmakers just didn't have enough money to do this sort of movie properly - so the question is, why'd they even bother?"
"Neruda is, like all the Larraín films I've seen, laudable in its ambitions and ultimately unsatisfying in its execution."
"Despite Decker trying her best to bring cinematic flair, Sky is routinely hobbled by treacly observations and broad characterization."
Everything in it is simply childish. [Full Review in Spanish]
Color me unconvinced.
"While the mordant ruthlessness of the asides at the expense of big business intrigues, indiscretions and Christmas parties is compromised by a final sequence of quite awful sentimentality."
"Though the movie is the most formulaic sort of testosterone-driven junk, it's served up expertly by director Justin Lin and his associates."
"This probably sounded like a surefire idea for a franchise, but there are so many plot twists that the narrative comes to resemble a Möbius strip. That wouldn't be so bad if at least the twists made a modicum of sense."
Sporadically intriguing but mostly interminable...
All but declaring out loud that it only exists to test the waters for the general viability of the MIB brand and the box office muscle of Thompson and Hemsworth outside their Marvel Cinematic Universe identities. But at least it doesn't lack for charm.
The script gives a pretty talented line-up of co-stars little that's cute or funny to say or do.
This is the kind of film that relies heavily on sledgehammer sound design and creepy imagery in the absence of a persuasive story.
A closer look reveals a number of worthwhile topics in the superstar&#8217;s life&#44; a fact which doesn&#8217;t necessarily improve the film&#44; but rather makes it all the more frustrating for not having the guts to dig deeper&#46;
"Tykwer is an intriguing filmmaker in his own right, and his creative approach to storytelling seems a bit stifled here. He sometimes reveals the same tale three different ways. While it's easy to see why he'd be eager to bring a coda to Kieslowski's legac"
Electric Cannes opener.
It's not really clear why this movie was necessary %u2013 it does not reinvent the 50's movie so much as do a highly faithful cover version of it. (Gus Van Sandy's shot-for-shot remake of Psycho is a similar pointless academic exercise.)
"Haskell comes off as a jerk -- but Mark somehow looks even worse: not just insincere but weak, vain and vindictive."
"Schwarzenegger is back, and his timing couldn't be any worse. At a time when violence in movies is being scrutinized, Arnold arrives with a no-holds-barred shoot-em-up in ""The Last Stand."""
The oddness is sort of refreshing.
"Grabinski seems fixated on keeping the audience on its toes, so much so that he neglects to construct a cohesive narrative."
Quickly degenerates into sentimental sappiness.
Always watchable yet ultimately self-defeating in terms of its tonal / aesthetic choices.
"Purgatory is an apt metaphor for the experience the new horror movie Soul Survivors offers its audiences. It may not amount to torment, but watching it definitely borders on torture."
"""Granny of the Dead"" undercuts a potentially potent horror premise by mining it for gross-out comedy."
Plenty of raunchy and funny scenes but not enough character development.
"Injured dancer learns new moves in inspiring, trite tale."
"""Ma Ma"" is a selfish film, and thus a failure. The picture is showy but empty exercise that professes intellectual weight by simply ticking Big Idea boxes, as well as emotional heft for putting its lead character through existential and physical turmoil."
"The memory of a hip street racing movie left long ago in the dust, the FF franchise has clearly wanted to be the next James Bond for some time -- and now has its mortifying Moonraker."
"A scattering of dance sequences that fuse hip-hop and classical beats provide a few shots of energy, but Take The Lead otherwise plods through the motions."
I've never seen so many people slap the backs of loved ones' heads in my entire life.
At first you can't believe that so much talent has been assembled. But by the end of this deathbed reverie you can't believe what they've done with that abundance.
This all-star gathering of scream legends ... proves definitively that just because you're undead doesn't mean you're alive.
"Unfortunately, of all the things this Saw is, sharp isn't one of them."
"You're constantly asking yourself 'Will it matter if I leave half-way through this film?""?!"
The same pointless exercise in violence and pseudo-mystical twaddle that the whole series has represented since 1986.
"...a thinly disguised fable about the superiority of 'the simple life,' but ultimately it says nothing."
"At its heart, this second sequel is standard slasher stuff, though director James Wong does rise (or maybe sink) to the occasion with grisly staging."
"Disobedience's lesbian lovers lack passion, and more frustratingly, they become increasingly passive."
Like Jackson missed the target completely and instead hit the cat standing 30 feet away from it.
"Unbelievable indeed, the film, directed by José Manuel Cravioto, nevertheless manages to captivate throughout."
"The sub-sub-Anaconda bottom-feeder Primeval makes the mistake of taking itself far too seriously; with its exploitative images of civil war and genocide, it's the Blood Diamond of 25-foot-killer-crocodile movies."
It is too bad the zeal so evident in that one scene is not replicated for the rest of the running time.
"If able to overlook its many faults, the uncritical viewer may find it a passable escapist thriller even if its absurd."
"The visuals are artistically fantastic, and the score strong, unfortunately the script/dialogue, impact, and pacing lack."
"The Dancer Upstairs is, like its director, sleek, mysterious and intelligent. But until its last-half hour or so, it is also, unfortunately, mind-numbing."
"There's something secondhand about everything here. Hoge seems to be mimicking the tone and fabric of other, better indie movies."
"The crowd-pleasing approach drains the material of its innate humanity, morphing the character's intimate struggles into melodramatic theater."
Assassins has a frantic surface spread over a shallow vaguely disconnected center.
If the film's psychology and dialogue remain frustratingly basic...the viscerally effective audio-visual approach amplif[ies] the story's emotional intimacy in ways the situations and mostly platitudinous dialogue sometimes fail to do.
"What exactly is the joke here? She's a ghost who wants to stop her fiancé from dating a living person. So she's the bad guy, right? And what's her plan? Just keep talking loudly? What a big comic set piece that is."
Honest Thief is just another unimpressive action showcase for [Liam] Neeson as yet another angry and misunderstood loner who's out for self-righteous vengeance ... Anyone expecting high-quality entertainment from Honest Thief will definitely feel cheated.
"The adaptation of the book was an evident continuation for its success and in the film, we see, once again, a quick production: pretty by the promotional envelope and completely failed in the attempt of content. [Full review in Spanish]"
"This is a very uneven mix of sombre drama about grief and wacky comedy about redemption, and it doesn't really find its stride until halfway through... It's kind of lovely, but it takes a long time to get there."
"Big, long, ultimately tedious"
"At best, Dance is the picture of so-close-yet-so-far disappointment."
"Except for the opening surveillance sequence, you'd never guess that Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck also directed the Oscar-winning The Lives of Others."
Anyone who wanders into License to Wed expecting a sweet-natured romantic comedy is likely to feel like the sensitive surface of that metaphorical tongue: ripped off.
"The jokes are, on paper, funny. On screen they just seem like the inevitable, the only thing to say, and their zing zags off into bland, familiar territory... the material didn't coalesce past pointing at something funny and saying, ""hey, that's funny al"
"Yet another small, ""sensitive"" character study of unassuming ""little"" folk trying their best under trying circumstances, all amounting to the purest banality."
"Looking back for a suitably rousing episode from our national past, Curtis has alighted on Dunkirk, a tragedy narrowly averted, which he reprises as mirthless, feelgood farce."
"If only one of his efforts would have shown any signs of the talent Shepard has revealed in past work, CHIPs would have risen from abysmal to merely awful."
"The film features one great casting decision and is mercifully only 88 minutes long. Beyond that, I've got nothing."
"Howard all too often fails to stage key scenes with the clarity they require, adding to the confusion."
"Marginally fascinating and well-edited, but has too much potatoes and not nearly enough meat for audiences hungry for insight about the second Golden Age of Animation."
It’s so businesslike and yearns so much for respectability that it squeezes much of the life out of itself.
Philip Martinez's Viktor is neither of significant quality nor campy enough to justify its bizarre existence.
"aims for an After Hours-style, nighttime stew of insanity and coincidence but ends up merely showcasing meaningless lives"
"Instead of building to some tragic-comedic level of peak awfulness, August:Osage County lurches from revelation to revelation without coming together as anything more than a sloppy weekend where a lot of nasty crap goes down."
"Packed with too many storylines, this drama feels like a zoo indeed."
This is the Schindler's List of B-list butchery.
The Reach's entertainment value is just as dry and empty as its vast desert location.
Never really finds its story.
If you&apos;re into strong performances and creepy images masterfully shot&#44; this is your film&#46; But if you&apos;re looking for suspense&#44; jump scares&#44; a coherent plot and motivation that involves more than an Oprah money shot&#44; will you find it here&#63; Nope&#46;
"Even as the film tediously tends to its arbitrary plot, Chandrasekhar displays almost oneiric reverence for the iconography of the TV show."
Almodóvar and Cruz fail to engage this time around.
The total absence of wit and humor doesn't help the meager romance.
"[Randle] holds the film together as best she can with her luminous presence and dignity, but can't supply the lacking subtext, past history and motivation."
"King of California means to be the jewel in the crown of indie-flick quirkiness, but it's really just a bauble with ambition."
"In a different world, the film would be just another five-minute skit blown up until it's not funny anymore; as it is, it's tasteless and offensive to boot."
"director Alan Taylor's (HBO's 'Game of Thrones') ploy is to revert to comedy whenever the plot stops making sense. Too often, we're treated to the sight of Stellan Skarsgrd (as scientist Erik Selvig) running around without his pants on."
"The humor of The Big Short is subprime, fourth-wall-breaking irony getting tiresome quickly. The crash was funnier."
"A hugely ambitious but deeply flawed soap opera that gallops through an exhausting roll call of births, deaths, broken hearts and life-changing bombshells."
Euphoria is undeniably a missed opportunity at creating a drama of frayed sisterhood that feels fresh and unique.
"It is so watch-ably unwatchable, it is magnificent... It's really true that when great actors make bad movies, they give the best terrible performances."
An unoriginal &quot;original&quot; film that Driver feels miscast in&#46; Also if you&apos;re going to rip off Spielberg&apos;s Jurassic Park &#40;or &quot;pay homage&quot;&#41; please at least take a page out of his other suspense playbooks and learn from Jaws on handling creature based tension&#46;
Simon Pegg and Nick Frost in a faltering extraterrestrial knockabout.
"The two fashion dummies have been jolted out of suspended animation for a semi-worthwhile wheeze. It's short at an economical hour-and-a-half but in the end, this is more prefab than ab fab."
The Warrior plays out like one big roll in the dirt and one long wargame.
The play kept experienced theatergoers on the edge of their seats. The picture will keep them on the edge of a nervous breakdown.
Bubble-brained comedy for the Olsen Twins demographic.
Another gimmicky one-joke comedy from the Wayans brothers that may not use as much makeup as White Chicks but lots more special effects and is even more dreadful.
"Underdeveloped and tedious, ""Art School Confidential"" left me irritated and annoyed."
"Rampage essentially throws The Rock, a few handsome co-stars, and a gaggle of semi-competent CGI shots into a blender, pours out the chunky mix into a bowl and sort of shrugs and says, ""eh, eat it, I guess."""
Kenneth Branagh's latest ho-hum potboiler benefits from an impressive cast - though he doesn't quite know what to do with them all - while unwinding a murder mystery that lacks in the actual mystery department. 
"Even those incapable of getting ahead of the film's big reveal ... will probably lose interest before all the cards are laid on the table. What's really been withheld, in this dreary drag of a movie, is a reason to care."
"The material comes packed with dramatic possibilities and rich metaphors, but Mr. Roy focuses most of his energy on caricaturing his wealthy former friends."
&apos;Firestarter&apos; isn&apos;t so hot&#46;
"It unpacks too many bizarre events in a short time frame to allow for much additional analysis. And the Broberg family, confessional to a fault, are primed more for honesty than for self-inspection."
"Peter Pan/Alice in Wonderland origin story has grief, peril."
"Stillwater so obviously wants to impress, but it just isn't a serious movie, thinking it can speak to U.S. social crises without committing to any sort of ideological principle."
Como parodiar algo que já não se levava muito a sério originalmente?
Fans of the game and the genre will be disappointed with the lack of gore ... and everyone else will find what plot there is confusing and boring.
"The Art of Racing in the Rain feels like such a jumble of half-formed ideas and grudging creative concessions that I was astonished to learn at the end that it had been adapted from a book, and not a month-long argument in a writers' room."
"Photographs Rome in a casually homogonous way, just like every other live-action Disney film."
Prefabricated and contrived.
The dullness works to Grey's favor as the 2008 AVN winner for Best Oral Sex Scene can't act a lick.
A film with little else to commend it from the obvious.
It's a flimsily sketched psychological sci-fi movie that never feels more than being robotic.
"No mystery why Hopkins climbed on board, the only mystery is why anyone else did."
Takes itself more seriously than any film called 'Cowboys & Aliens' ever should.
"Daisy Ridley and Tom Holland are poorly matched protagonists in Chaos Walking. The central premise, ""Noise"", is extremely annoying and persists through the entire film."
A Mickey Mouse Club therapy session.
"If I wanted the story read to me, I would have bought the book on tape."
"On any level other than as sheer visual sensation, 2012 is a joke, for the simple reason that it has no point of view."
A barbed but frequently uneven comedy taking aim at the fast fashion industry.
Is it outrageous to expect a Roman Polanski movie titled 'Carnage' to have a little more bite?
"tate of Play is a smoothly written, almost instantly forgettable procedural featuring people we have trouble caring about."
"When you find yourself longing for ""Turner and Hooch,"" things are very bleak indeed."
"In Live by Night, Ben Affleck finds every imaginable way to shoot his own film in the foot - and then light a match and set fire to the gaping wound, as it hobbles away into oblivion."
[A] soggy mess of a movie ...
"Light on plot but loaded with style, Suicide Squad is all character and charisma but ultimately empty and largely saved by Robbie and Smith."
Blinded by the Light actually avoids everything that is interesting about cross-ethnic pop culture.
"Wrath of Man fails to make the most of an inventive story structure and a typically solid Statham performance, smothering both under a layer of bland masculinity with none of the style and swagger that made Ritchie's early work so memorable."
" The best reason for everybody else to collect a check for it is that no one will remember anything except Bruce Willis was in it, he was bad and the picture was worse."
"Although not a chore to sit through, the whole thing seems rather clunkily thought out and offers precious little worth remembering once the end credits have rolled."
Screwball comedy about prostitute aims for farce but misses.
"The premise has potential, as does the casting, but the script is so mind-numbingly lazy that it insults its audience at every turn."
"By the end of this 132-minute journey, I had grown somewhat weary of the tug of war between the two leads, despite disarming efforts from Hammer and Chalamet."
A fair-to-middling cop drama whose intentions are unfortunately rendered murky and submerged by a predictable story and limp characterization.
Gilroy also throws in a reverse chronology taking place in posh foreign locations (and Cleveland!) so as to mark the film as his own and conceal any narrative weaknesses.
"For a good laugh, check it out; for good action, look elsewhere."
A hermetically sealed creep-fest that seems to have no desire to be anything more than just that.
The movie just doesn't take any of its situations far enough. Resulting in let down after let down.
"Tavernier's fatal flaw is letting the film bog down in studio politics and the filmmaking process, something which hasn't carried a ""serious"" film since The Player."
"The story is a mishmash of demonic possession, Satanic killings, machines suddenly switching on and off and vacantly-staring figurines. It's more familiar than frightening. And the human actors are no more compelling than the poker-faced dolls."
"While David imagines other worlds for profit, Martian Child crash-lands on this one."
"The title refers to the speed with which the film is cut by its director, a specialist in music videos. It could also apply to what otherwise peaceable folk might want to do should they get their hands around his throat."
Using patient to describe this grim horror tale is just being polite for Could you go any slower? 
Characters acting falsely just to fool some imaginary 3rd party who may be looking on like The Purple Rose of Cairo is as bad as a living room magician from pre-school telling their spectators to close their eyes while they hide the ball. Only not as cute
"Landesman doesn't really connect these stories other than through the tragedy itself -- and, taken separately, none of the stories has any great depth."
"It's all so tediously presented as a shallow comedy cocktail, with a rim of salty humor and a twist of subversive edge, that midway through the film I wanted a martini glass to hurl at the screen."
De Palma resembles more of a visual IMDB page than a film.
"This film is relatively pitiless, exhausting the audience until we acquiesce to Becky's rage."
"The acting is ice cold. The dialogue is lethargic. And if we're going to sit through any movie that's 177 minutes, it better have some Hobbits in it. There are no Hobbits here, so stay home."
"As if running low on dramatic irony, Jim Carrey and his just-add-water team of merry pranksters from 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' and 'Liar Liar' come armed with a premise as heavenly as they come - and aim for sea level."
"It's one-death-fits-all, and it gets enormously dull by the time the film finally arrives at its legitimately creative final sequence."
"Everyone here — the actors, the audience, the genre — deserves better. "
The Laundromat is a jumble that only makes this confusing issue even more difficult to comprehend.
Neil Jordan is a fine director. He has done a very fine job of crafting a film that is quite depressing and unsatisfying.
"We keep seeing Heigl's potential as a fine comic actress and, the curse of optimism, continue to be disappointed when she betrays her best instincts."
"The way Malick romanticizes that which isn't human while broadly, pointlessly criticizing aspects of suggested human weakness completely separates from the emotional spectrum he should engage."
More like WILD HOGS than WILD.
"Schumer remains likable, and the film has its moments, but there are so many excellent opportunities here for poignant cringe comedy that more often than not I Feel Pretty feels like a missed opportunity -- and a slow, ponderous one at that."
The magnificent acting of José Ferrer and the clarion rhetoric of Edmond Rostand's semi-classic drama are not quite enough to conceal the central weaknesses of the story.
Somber low-budget psychological thriller that doesn't kick in with much of a splash until the climax.
"Hollywood's version of the annual Hallmark Ho-ho-ho card. It's made to order: just slot in the perennial Mr. Santa Claus himself, Tim Allen, and stir."
"For all its electrifying potential, I found little to keep my attention, less still to ponder afterwards in terms of What It All Means."
"With a clunky script, uninspired female characters and, dare I say it, miscasting of Cruise, The Mummy is a tangle of ideas on a decomposing skeleton."
A frustratingly inscrutable film that fails to engage.
There&#8217;s nothing about this family-friendly movie that&#8217;s outrageously offensive&#44; but there&#8217;s nothing about it that&#8217;s particularly interesting&#44; well-executed&#44; or inventively conceived either&#46;
"""The Predator"" is one hot mess."
"Ella Smith dominates proceedings with a very strong performance, but the sparse narrative and fairly lacklustre supporting cast is on far shakier ground."
"The problem with most redemption narratives, besides the fact their emotional range seems calculated to win awards, is that they bask in the seeming paradoxes of their premise."
Ultimately feels empty.
"Penn goes for larger-than-life, wrapping his pinched frown around an unintelligible Louisiana drawl and swinging his arms like an autistic evangelist."
Stephen Peters' script veers as wildly as a pilotless skiff in the Everglades. Moments of drama mingle with moments of (apparently) unintentional comedy. 
"Rock On 2 could have been so much more, but winds up as a dim echo of the original film."
The biggest problem with this movie is I wasn't rooting for anybody.
A movie trying to do so much that it does nothing.
Somehow the humor and purpose of this project escaped me.
What's that smell? The plain isn't the only thing that's charred in screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga's directorial debut; subtlety goes up in flames too.
"Despite its lofty aspirations, Angels & Demons is no less artificial and forced than the latest Fast & Furious sequel. Different target audience, same motive: easy money."
"It's derivative as hell, but the first half of The Rite still manages to be fairly interesting because it takes noticeable steps to differentiate itself from The Exorcist."
"It would have been fine but the acting is pretty over the top, making scenes almost laughable."
Toothless and mild.
"Like a cross between Man on Fire and Bad Boys 2, this demolition derby delivers eye-popping action sequences that would make even the Roadrunner roll his eyes in disbelief."
The shame is that an excellent cast could have been better served.
It's so bad it needs new words for bad.
"It's hard not to feel sorry for the high-profile cast, obviously working for brownie points in heaven -- they're so good, yet nothing they do can make the movie fly."
"Ribbing wisecracks, courtesy of co-writer Joss Whedon, jar with director Zack Snyder's oppressive, dour approach to the source material."
Mary Poppins Returns is the cinematic equivalent of a very pleasant British greeting.
"When a character remarks near the end that 'some things are best forgotten,' she could be talking about this dreary, unexciting thriller."
"Ultimately, we're left with 90 minutes worth of good intentions and sweet sentiments that never coalesce into an involving story."
"Unfortunately, Weaver and Jeunet's efforts are short changed by the ineptness of Joss Whedon's script, that seems to find a way to make action sequences unexciting."
This is a lying movie full of lies. The first lie is that the mere presence of Cook is automatically funny.
"The put-on, of course, consists in never really letting the audience know what level of seriousness the film is at, and the movie itself sometimes seems unsure."
The film’s shrugging disregard for historical context would be negligible were the romance not so tedious and clichéd.
"Hahahaha. Really, that's about all there is to say about ""San Andreas"" ..."
Dreadful acting and ropy action sequences will likely doom this thriller to well-deserved obscurity.
"A desire for ambiguity and choppy editing render the film frustrating to watch, tumbling into pointless mystery."
"The climax smacks of either screenwriter desperation, directorial indecision, or ""this worked in the book."""
"This is just embarrassing, a simply and utterly embarrassing attempt to market money from a charming film."
Because nothing says giggly slasher escapism quite like child endangerment and abortion discussions. Please pass the popcorn.
"For baseball fans, it delivers the high heat. For the non-fan, there may be a little too much inside baseball."
Producer Joel Silver...comes up with a mediocre thriller that moves briskly but goes no where.
My hot take? It left me a bit cold.
"I think Abrahamson understands that Jack is more than a little f*****-up. If that's true, Room has betrayed him terribly, too."
"Netflix can knock these kind of crime dramas off the conveyor belt with ease and with far less starpower attached, so how is it that three Oscar winners came to make something this uneventful? That's the real mystery here."
Mira Nair's handsome but inert adaptation of Jhumpa Lahiri's Pulitizer Prize winning novel is another reminder of the fact that some books were not born to be movies.
"... the film wishes it were as eccentric as Rushmore, ... but the dubious whimsy, devoid of any directorial voice, plays more like a very special episode of Dawson's Creek."
"Through no fault of Mr. Roth's, his character isn't interesting enough to sustain our involvement in the story. Neil's detachment doesn't intrigue us, it only detaches us in our turn."
"Why is the movie like eating the white of a hard boiled egg with no salt, pepper, or any other flavor except ""white?"""
Abrams doesn't get the franchise that Roddenberry created.
"By the time it rolls into its sluggish, momentum-free third act, Submarine has established itself as a disappointingly uneven piece of work..."
All talents are ill-served by the unambitious handling of the material.
...hopelessly stale...

"Without help from either script or director, poor Bullock gets stuck as a distant runner-up in this featherweight farce."
"This smooth but bland thriller may be the best we could possibly expect from John Woo directing a Philip K. Dick adaptation, especially when Ben Affleck is added to the mix."
"Disney's desire to drain as much profit out of their properties as possible arrives in the form of Maleficent, and boy does the struggle show."
"From the title onward, it and its army of Hefner pals are out to show you what a nice, sweet, gentle, open-minded guy the old pornographer is."
"A glorified behind-the-scenes doc from the time Jim Carrey interpreted Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon, this doc has great footage but loses its way trying to pretend is deeper that it actually is."
"Instead of skewering self-important stars and vapid journalists, Friends gets muddled in slapstick and crude humor."
"Though children will mostly be enthralled by the spectacles, even they might notice the weak story protruding through the industrial magic."
Wes Anderson follows Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums with ... the same film for the third time.
There's a difference between kid-friendly and just regular old dumb.
"The mystery is never very compelling, Paul McGuigan's direction tends to be obvious and flat, many of the characters are stagy and unconvincing."
A thousand words? Try two words: stay away. Murphy does a pretty good job keeping up with the various indignities heaped on him but the movie as a whole ends up sinking.
Please let it be the last Shyamalan.
Please don't give Martin any more of your money.
"""Runaway Train"" isn't just bad -- it's bodaciously bad, grotesquely overblown, lurid in its emotion, big ideas on its brain."
What could Sofia Coppola possibly be thinking&#63; Why would she make this intensely complacent film&#63;
Bad film: shallow writing with plenty of torture and showing off instead. Not what I expected from the director behind Dog Soldiers.
The movie seems at times a little too pleased with itself and its mordant observations on humanity.
I forgot to mention in the body of my review that Tig Notaro is the only thing good in the movie&#44; so I will make that statement in this here pull quote&#46; The rest of the movie is a tedious journey into Hell&#46;
Almost every good moment in the film is sandwiched between two bits that aren't nearly as well built.
"Never lives up to - or, for that matter, does anything to deserve - the recent parody tribute offered by Michael Bolton in a ""Saturday Night Live"" digital short..."
A waste of time.
"Despite being a great technological advancement, this hyper realistic remake doesn't quite capture the magic of the original film. [Full review in Spanish]"
"A working class ""us vs. them"" opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered."
...a disappointing misfire that's aged terribly in the years since its 1998 release.
It's woeful as a documentary history -- a real missed opportunity.
"Right from the start, however, there are signs that Vacation might be a comically unlucky film."
The opening narration by Christopher Walken starts sucking the life out of the film before it gets a chance to gain any momentum.
"Mortal Engines is a lifeless fantasy epic that is mildly enjoyable at times, but suffers from several grave afflictions that ultimately incur steep viewing consequences."
"For all of its non-commonplace perspectives, the movie finally feels a bit thin."
All the elements of the crowd pleaser and manipulative documentary evidently worked with the members of the Academy. [Full Review in Spanish]
"If the movie, which starts out shakily, improves in the second half, it is a discombobulated grab bag of jokes peopled with characters who have little emotional resonance."
"The story takes an even sharper left turn in the last half hour, raising emotional issues it can't adequately address."
Seldom entertaining.
Pulpy late-60's spy silliness.
"The main problem with the film is the extremely bloated script, which slows to a crawl immediately after the murder and then meanders all over the place."
"The Lodge has been made with an undeniable degree of seriousness and stylishness, which only serves to further heighten just how nonsensical the whole thing really is."
The visuals are stunningly realised and complement deep thematic and moral ideas. Yet Life is terribly undisciplined. It is the story of a selfless man told by one who refuses to get out of his own way.
Spielberg trades in his usually powerful ideals for an unsettling combination of phony humanism and pandering realism.
"This time Mr. De Palma has traveled beyond camp into sloppy sadism, with the audience cast in the role of victim."
This is a romantic comedy but one that would need only the very slightest tweaking to be transformed into a home invasion horror movie.
All the film has to show for its efforts are tired platitudes about the value of altruism and living each day as it if were the last.
"Movie Che is a towering idealist who just keeps on coming, but he lacks any sense of character. He is heartless, all computer chips and wires inside. He's the Revolutionator."
"With both movies and TV constantly mining mob life for script fodder, Made never comes up with a new twist on the material."
you've seen this movie before
Rendition is the result of such pompous over-pronouncements. It's a well-intentioned screed undone by its desire to make all sides of its conflict saintly simplistic.
You don't want to be in Adam Sandler's shoes right now.
"Genre fans will be happy to see Barbeau and Wise, as well as the brief but gasp-inducing moments of gore. But it's laughably bad, leaving audiences to giggle while wondering if they're sharing in Mike's hallucinations or this crazy movie actually exists."
There are plenty of films out there competing for your money ... 'The Internship' doesn't even deserve a part-time gig ...
"Disney's Black Beauty adaptation is all in on Horse Girl Canon. However, it is not interested in moving the canon forward as a foundational text."
The rotten cliches pile up faster than the bodies in this Z-movie disaster. A total dud start to finish.
Paul Thomas Anderson shits the bed of his own movie with a couple of truly horrendous scenes of anti-Asian caricature&#46;&#10;&#10;Not funny&#46;&#10;&#10;Deal-breaker&#46;&#10;&#10;What a waste&#46;
At its worst&#44; Dangerous Game&#58; The Legacy Murders is an ugly and nasty movie&#44; but even at the low bar of its relative best&#44; it&apos;s just incompetent&#46;
What this movie needs is Cybill Shepherd playing hard to get. Or anybody playing hard to get.
"A slightly patchy tapestry that tickles about as much as it annoys, full of unexpected laughs but also some torturous dead spots."
"For his 49th feature film, Allen returns to a well that is not so much dry as desiccated."
You'd probably need a veteran Hollywood psychiatrist to explain Tinseltown's fascination with its own muck.
"McAdams presents a head-scratching and tone-deaf image of the beloved TV personality. With nary a plot point in sight besides a light rivalry and an old flame, Wilson must cling for dear life to the caricatured portrait of the hapless small town hero."
"The idea of the sprightly actress playing a kick-ass bounty hunter is certainly tantalizing; yet, sadly, the role of Domino Harvey provides little for Knightley to do but smoke cigarettes and snarl vacantly in between shootouts."
"The Maxim revolution kicks off with Fired Up and the fact that even the now Hammond-less skin mag's name is nowhere to be found on the title, should tell you that even they are trying to maintain some dignity."
"The effort to put a personal face on the major issue of occupation is as timely as Iraq and Afghanistan, but the execution is clumsy and clich-ridden."
"All in the movie have been encouraged to play up the cartoonish aspects of their characters, and they deliver punch lines like a series of elbows to the rib cage."
"Mired in forced sentimentality, the film never really builds up a great deal of steam but infuses some bursts of anger and humor here and there."
Rohrwacher strives to lighten the allegorising with bits of humour and antic surrealism. We still feel as if we are watching a Brecht play done by street buskers. The view into the kitchen garden of history starts to become pedagogic.
"An awkward, labored narrative structure derails any chance for Bird and co-writer Damon Lindelof to explore the progressive concepts they're so keen to introduce."
An unnaturally clumsy horror-thriller.
"A botched adventure that looks suspiciously like any number of other sci-fi tales you will have seen, and pales instantly by the comparison."
I hereby pronounce you a flop.
"Neither Jackson nor the ""Rare Exports"" writer-director are gonzo enough to make this come off."
The Hitcher is a dull comparison to the original that will annoy fans as much as those of Bay's previous retreads.
"The third time is not the charm in this second sequel, which changes up the franchise formula-and not in a good way."
This is one of those untaxing time-killers where you spend a lot of time pondering which of its actress's changing hairstyles you like best.
"There's an overall lifelessness to A Master Builder, as if Demme were embalming the Shawn-Gregory stage show rather than making it live onscreen."
The emotional lives of the leads are as vacuous as a Joey Fatone B side.
The slapdash missions are shoot with a handheld immediacy but the plot and the action lose momentum after the midpoint.
Just because Channing Tatum looks good in Roman soldier garb doesn't mean he can act like one.
... as dull as watching somebody else play an incoherent video game ...
"A few minutes of nail-biting, recreated heroism isn't enough to justify the other 90-or-so minutes in Clint Eastwood's dry salute of a movie, which struggles to mix patriotism, friendship, God, and destiny into something meaningful."
"All Stars is a 3-D tweenie dance movie set in London, with some iffy acting and a script that seems to have been written by a committee of concerned parents."
Guess what - it's bad!
The ending pulls the rug out from under this tepid-to-medium hothouse drama.
"Stupid, stupid, stupid: Shame on Sandler & Co."
"Arlington Road is a dumb, overheated thriller pretending to be a smart, topical one."
"Indiana Jones 4 is a terrible idea, but might we suggest a remake of On Golden Pond as an alternate?"
In reality this is only a muscly product. [Full review in Spanish] 
"There’s a sharper satire lurking in the story’s DNA—that of an ambitious, well-meaning filmmaker who’s so determined to make a conversation piece that he ends up saying nothing much at all."
"A step backwards for Steve Martin's writing career, but a big step forward for Claire Danes."
I never want to dance again.
A tacky mix of neon lights and bare skin.
"This is a movie lacking in life or vibrancy, or any real emotions for us to actually connect to or relate to the characters; it is enamoured by its subject matter and as such tries to make itself too respectful."
"Traditional and uninspired, it does an adequate job of relating Duran's story but falls short of providing an engaging cinematic experience."
"This is one of the more pointless follow-ups ever, just an assortment of scary-movie tropes randomly doled out, with unavoidable jolts at regular intervals."
The rest of the cast spend so much time trying to avoid tripping over each other and the electric wires strewn all over the carpets that the suspension of disbelief becomes an increasingly strenuous chore.
Batman & Robin really feels as if director Joel Schumacher was painting by numbers.
"Frankly, to call The Pacifier a ""cookie cutter"" movie is an insult to the folks who actually make cookie cutters."
"Just Friends hangs its crude, clobbering sense of humor on a dubious theory."
"Ageless beauty Sandra Bullock gives her typical automated performance in a superficial cross between the recent ""Deja Vu"" and Bullock's own excruciating movie ""The Lake House."""
"It does not want to shock you, provoke you, frighten you, intellectually stimulate you, or even teach you anything you do not already know."
"As a recession-era satire, Repo Men strikes a very bitter chord."
"A pretentious film due to its forced narrative complexity, where the mystery doesn't engage and the resolution of it appears abruptly. [Full review in Spanish]"
A perversely compelling collection of ghastly ideas...
"""Guardians of the Galaxy"" relied too much on the audience already knowing the Marvel mythology. Call it, in my opinion, an unacceptable shorthand."
"Despite Cera's consderable charm, the alternately scruffy and diffident tone that Arteta and Nash bring to the material leave it feeling both forced and limp."
"... might get viewers stirred up about the hypocrisies of racial politics, but it's unlikely to change many perspectives."
"Wright is capable of much better, as is everyone in the cast. He's trying to make a silky Euro thriller with a frisson of controversy. It's more like a never-ending trailer."
"""The Little Things"" occasionally delivers the pleasures of a deep, dark noir, but it's mostly just a shadow of other films."
"One of those movies some people will hail as artistic, imaginative and visionary, while the rest of us wonder if those people are high."
This Ludlum-esque political thriller... might be funny if it wasn't exploiting such a serious topic as the Holocaust.
Bergman's screenplay leaves nothing to the imagination and turns the film into a windy soap opera most of the time; what might have been a masterpiece in the TV original (although I doubt it) becomes in its truncated form mostly elegant mush.
You People doesn't work because it works too hard.
"The storytelling never quite coalesces, and the movie remains a series of pointed scenes packed with ominous dialog and the occasional flurry of action."
"Too much of Monsters simply reminds you of other, better movies..."
"The film's fatal flaw is Borte's refusal to give his satire the darker, uncomfortable edge it needs to give his lesson some impact."
Director David Gordon Green and writers Danny McBride and Ben Best have put together a completely unfunny film filled to the brim with non-stop sexual references and other bits of lowbrow humor.
"Once everyone gets to the abbey, the film simply gives up the ghost and cynically indulges every horror trick in the book."
"... Americanized beyond recognition from its Oscar-winning version. The central mystery has been drastically altered to fit Julia Roberts, its most telling clue diluted, and a signature sequence that made soccer exciting now makes baseball duller."
the film tells its tale of abandonment&#44; poverty&#44; abuse&#44; and murder in such a placid manner&#44; smoothing over any possible rough edges&#44; that it is bereft of emotional depth
"The real-life Modigliani did indeed live a short, tragic life, but this factually inaccurate, plodding film makes it feel twice as long."
Absolutely nothing works. No one seems to understand the place or the people. And the only thing gleaned from the lumber industry is that you can build an entire movie from performances made of wood.
"Gilliam drains any remaining signs of life and humanity from his adult characters, underscoring their grotesqueness with expressionistic camera work and shock-tactic effects."
A weird melodramatic epic -- Bonanza crossbred with the kind of novel that uses Fabio on the cover.
"The Rental is a colossal disappointment. There were far too many pointless conversations and loose ends, and the story felt like it had no point. If this film wasn't written by Dave Franco, I doubt it would have been made."
...the movie feels like a poor man's updated Bad News Bears...an uneventful state of mind soaked in absolute mediocrity.
"The visual grandeur cannot hide clichd dialogue, thin characters, and a frustrating lack of development."
"Most fairy tales on film contain either enough wit or verve or spectacle to engage an entire audience, but there is nothing here to engage the adult viewer. Nothing."
"You might expect a serious-minded movie about a troubled kid who really thinks he's from Mars to confront the fact that this kid really is troubled. Not so much, here."
"Rami Malek is the movie and the only reason why it stands out, not much beyond his acting. [Full review in Spanish]"
Where the original had the distinct flavor of 1970s kitsch ... Petersen's movie has loads of CGI and a cameo appearance from Black Eyed Peas front woman Fergie.
"Noah Hawley's directorial debut may have started out as a feminist-forward film decrying the fact that women have to work five times as hard to succeed in the workplace, but it ends up being a movie whose message boils down to, ""Ladies be crazy."""
"After a while, The Woman in Black amounts to an elaborate jack-in-the-box. Yes, it will make you jump. But will you remember what forced you out of your seat a month from now? Or even next week? Probably not."
"One of the most plain, unimaginative romantic comedies I've ever seen."
[The stars] deserve a much stronger showcase than this Laurel & Hardy Go Policin' vehicle.
&#46;&#46;&#46;a bit like going to dinner at a gourmet restaurant&#44; sitting down in the handsomely-appointed dining room&#44; having a sommelier pour a paired wine with your gorgeous-looking dinner&#44; and taking a bite&#8230; only to find that the food is underseasoned&#46;
The movie forces us to endure so much meanness without a proper resolution at the end of it. It's all ordeal and no payoff.
"a film of many virtues, but...it gets stuck in a tediously repetitive cycle"
"With any luck, The Air I Breathe should be the last gasp of the faux-Altmanesque school of serendipitous storytelling."
It's not silly enough to be a youth comedy and not sophisticated enough to be a satisfying adult movie.
"Official Secrets is a pretty sorry substitute for predecessors like Spotlight and Snowden, which were both pretty sorry in their own right."
"Political commentary and ordinary human drama take a back seat to what are essentially uninterrupted, full song performances."
Smallfoot ends up as a messy mix of socio-theological allegory and straightforward fluff with a narrative that's too often frozen in its tracks.
"Comes across as a very unimaginative re-working, a shallow interpretation."
"When a 97-minute film seems protracted, there are script problems."
"The only thing memorable about Sex and the City 2 is the number two part, which describes it totally, if you get my drift."
It's shallow and pedantic exploitation wearing a dollar store mask to pass as social commentary.
Freddy Got Fingered for dummies.
"Overall, it's a pretty mediocre family film."
"This is one of the most dreadful, smug, and incoherent films I have ever seen, and a travesty of its many large subjects."
The problem is Pablo Larrain chose to portray Jackie as a flat emotionally distant character.
Three hours and twenty minutes of deadly boredom tinted with disgust!
"If Saw 2 became blockbuster with the tagline ""Oh yes, there will be blood,"" The Ringer should use the warmer and fuzzier promise, ""Oh yes, there will be hugs."""
The psychological aspects of the story are far more interesting than the murder mystery. [Full review in Spanish]
"This ham-fisted, teen-centric blend of Harry Potter and the infinitely more spellbinding Jason and the Argonauts comes within a cyclops' eyelash of being so bad it's almost (but not quite) good."
Earnestly optimistic drama misses the mark.
You can scarcely help checking yourself for exit wounds as you leave the theater.
Abrams seems more concerned with emulating the Spielbergian way than mining the true emotion that can be felt.
The first movie's genesis story was more fun than the perfunctory doomsday scheme trotted out here.
"The Dirt is recommended for die-hards, but casual fans will find little to strengthen their affinity for the Crüe."
Oscar Isaac is tremendous as always... I didn't love it and I really wanted to.
"A ""perfect"" flick for the Reagan era: a simplistic, distorted comicstrip actioner that nonetheless must have tapped into the collective nightmare that some American soldiers were still held prisoners or were missing in action in Vietnam."
The boy wants to dig for mystery! The girl wants him to stay home and do taxes! No amount of thoughtful dialogue is going to redeem that setup.
Men eventually does segue into a progressively off-the-wall and avant-garde midsection that slowly-but-surely drains one&#8217;s enthusiasm and attention&#46;&#46;&#46;
"It's an intriguing true story but Red Joan isn't the slick, gripping thriller you might expect."
Too many dead ends like this lead to a choppy narrative that lacks the slick and shiny cohesion the filmmakers seem to be attempting.
I don't know anything to redeem the movie except for an understated performance from Leigh -- unless you're into masochism. Avoid.
"Despite all its angst and bitterness, Prey doesn't convey the pure appreciation of rock 'n' roll that goofy Jack Black embodies in School."
"Has some funny moments, but it's not a great movie."
"It was bound to happen sooner or later. If the Broccoli family refused to reinvent the James Bond franchise, it was inevitably going to be reinvented for them."
Questions themselves are much more engaging than the actual answers.
takes a preposterous idea and makes it even more so
"A film that squanders a potentially intriguing premise and, in John Woo, a stylish director on a film that is merely content to waste them on a silly collection of clichés."
It's Christensen's lumberlike performance and some really dumb plotting and dialogue that the film will probably be remembered for most.
"It's horrific to watch Kennedy and his cast not even care about what they're putting out into the world. People, we're getting closer to Ow! My Balls! every day."
While there are flashes of impressive direction - especially in his use of location - Bettany's woefully underwritten script almost immediately dogs Shelter down.
"With a story that would be right at home in a lame-brained Rob Schneider comedy, the film seems to have been spit out by some sort of devious Hollywood assembly line."
"The longer Resistance goes on it's easy to actively grow tired of it; the movie doesn't evolve, it just goes forward in time showing key events without any character or emotional context"
The animation was inconsistent and overall it had a gloomy tone I couldn't see past.
"Michael Caton-Jones directs with bland disinterest, but Stone hams it up with the campy relish of a drag queen doing Faye Dunaway in Mommie Dearest."
"We get an irritated Nancy Drew with a flashlight, stomping about in mukluks through a plot with as much clarity as an ice storm at midnight."
"Some movies say something, and others have something to say. The Report can be filed as the latter, a film about an important subject that manages to not be an important film."
Don't try to make Nazi Germany cute.
"Jackman portrays Hart with an unwavering, often-frustrating idealism, a cold, one-dimensional straightforwardness that doesn't ever allow us to fully connect with him."
I haven't seen a film this year that so openly invited me to revile each and every one of its characters -- and I reviewed The Human Centipede.
"The biggest surprise of this mythical swashbuckler is how downright dull it is. Wrath is supposed to be emotional, right? And Titans? Shouldn't they at least be compelling?"
"I'd like to see someone make a documentary about Packouz and Diveroli, because there's a really interesting story here somewhere."
It's a poor show when a biopic can offer little to recommend its subject beyond her fame.
A movie chock-full of squandered potential&#46;
"If you saw the trailers and liked what you saw, go ahead and just buy one of the older video games in the series used for $4.99."
"This movie will not find an audience. It's got likable stars, a reliable commercial genre and a decent supporting cast, but nobody will turn out to see it, even if it was a labor of love."
"Neruda certainly has its felicities, but throughout Larraín proves all too eager to point out the sheer artifice of his endeavor."
The characters and their supernatural love triangle are developed with a businesslike efficiency that makes it almost impossible to invest in them emotionally.
"A great actor giving a terrible performance as the lead villain is but one of the many, many, MANY unfortunate elements in The Dark Tower."
"Anne Hathaway is charming and magnetic, but her journey across fairyland is laughable, a series of co-incidences and instantaneous edits."
"Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is simply forced, listless and borderline excruciating."
"I doubt bets will be taken on there being a ""3""."
The film settles into a Forrest Gumpian groove that doesn't glorify the human spirit so much as sap it.
"Project Almanac has some amusing moments, but its found footage format confounds, frustrates and ruins the film's loopy fun."
"If there were such a thing as a paint-by-numbers kit to create an indie flick, the end result would look something like this."
Girls With Balls scores some points for its Z-movie conceits but could have benefited from stronger writing and direction.
"I like Reynolds as an actor, and even I was bored."
"Director Renny Harlin helms like a bat out of hell, and obviously doesn't know a pentagram from a mammogram."
"As is the case with so many films that are billed as 'based on a true story,' Flyboys hopes to skate by on its fascinating subject matter alone."
All that's left for Brand fans is to put on the DVDs of his live shows to remember what a great comic he is.
"For all his ambition, Serkis can't find the right tone for Mowgli and it becomes a very confused beast, neither fun enough for all ages to enjoy nor complex enough to be the visceral, grown-up thriller he nudges at."
"By far too stylized, the film loses itself in this would-be ""dynamic visual"" style over content and coherence."
"The movie has been dumbed down and larded with transparent messages about teamwork, loyalty and doing the right thing until only the least-sophisticated children will be able to tolerate its inanities."
"As a chaser to Affleck's last offering of pungent Beantown brew, The Town is near-beer."
"The story it tells is distressingly out of date, especially in its antique notions of what constitutes ""success"" for girls."
A sweet yet only slightly satisfying comedy that doesn't let its nonsensical ideas get in the way of a few smile-worthy gags.
"[A] too-long, violent horror anthology ..."
"We get a strange mutant beast, half Nickelodeon movie, half R-rated comedy. It's like kids with potty-mouth playing grownup."
"I only wish Howard could have shaped this and the other performances a little, toning them down or leaving a bit of a rough edge."
Better you should go rent Blood Simple and see what it's all about.
"Weerasethakul is, in fact, the blandest of visionaries. His picturesque images lack the intensity found in the great folkloric artist-filmmaker Julin Hernndez."
"It's far too long, too self-conscious of its dramatic intentions, and too emotionally distant."
"Shyamalan is far better at setup than payoff, and the Sixth Sense director's latest once and for all cements that reputation."
The Ice Road starts promisingly but lacks the stamina to go the full distance.
"Many elements of The Return are quite sophisticated as past and present converge and Joanna's pursuer catches her scent. It's too bad that the plot takes us into irrationality, past the point of no return."
"A formulaic blend of slapstick and sentiment that youngsters up to age ten or so will probably enjoy, though it's not much superior to the sort of teleflicks they can regularly see on kids' cable channels."
"Pearl himself is impeccable, but however merited, the film's encomiums cloy, like the short-lived TV program that reported only ""good"" news items."
"The results come close to those cheesy re-enactments we see during ""true crime"" documentaries on Oxygen and other cable channels."
"""Shutter Island"" starts with a great deal of promise, but doesn't deliver."
"... I anticipated that Luther himself would be an inspiring figure, filled with the power of his convictions. What we get is an apologetic outsider with low self-esteem, who reasons himself into a role he has little taste for."
"It's 'The Passion of the Christ' for military enthusiasts - an epic of pain and suffering, meant to bludgeon civilians into a guilt trip."
...plays out like a subpar movie-of-the-week...
"Well-meaning to a fault, Antwone Fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man's triumph of will into everyman's romance comedy."
Like being forced to sit through an overly long wedding video in the living room of a couple you hardly even know.
"For a movie so obsessed with the details of daily life, then, it was that much more disappointing when it pulled a punch at its end to merely suggest tragedy, instead of actually showing it."
"With humor that makes Bill & Ted seem intelligent, this sequel is pretty much garbage. We had to wait five years for this?"
The way the screenwriters treat the law is in many ways similar to way they treat intelligence of the viewers.
"That one special summer after college wherein boys become men and learn about the dark doings of the world is herein re-enacted to particularly wan, if determinedly literary, effect."
"As Ayers, a Juilliard-trained cellist reduced to homelessness, Foxx turns The Soloist from a mildly effective inspirational tale into an aggressive awards-season advertisement."
"One of 2003's worst, Honey lazily steals its story from a host of '80s musical-themed flicks."
"Little more than a cascade of genre clichés, lightly dusted with heavy-handed, and arguably insensitive, cultural trappings."
A half-baked political thriller that reeks of a feature-length student YouTube clip.
A story that's not just dauntingly square but massaged to the point where you can't trust it at all.
Trumbo was hauled out of Congress shouting about American concentration camps. How do you fail to find the drama in that? Roach and McNamara find a way.
This topic deserved better than America's Most Wanted.
"A monumental senseless circus that only its creator comprehends, Alejandro Jodorowsky has never done cinema for anyone else but himself. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Part musical, part coming-of-age romance, all clichéd."
"An epic fantasy that tries to outdo Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but doesn't touch us emotionally."
"While We Have a Pope contains an interesting idea for a film, it ultimately fails to portray the struggle Cardinal Melville is going through, which is the centerpiece of the entire film."
Leave it to Sundance to program a film like this and have it not live up to its title.
A surprisingly ineffective cast delivers a muddled religious message
"Once again Marvel have served up a film with all the edges blunted, where even a little passionate smooching is rendered ridiculous and sexless."
Too caustic to be as funny as it easily should be with this scenario and in some cases these exact lines of dialogue.
"This is a perfect example of a sophomore slump endeavor, in which Hosking loses himself to greater resources."
It may possibly be that Mr. Spielberg has chosen gigantic size and unlimited quantity as his comedy method in the awareness that he has no gift whatsoever for small-scale comic conceits.
Not only is it incomplete despite a running time of 149 minutes... but its action would be meaningless to anyone who hasn't seen a good many previous Marvel pictures.
"Like other aspects of the movie, this portrait of urban life doesn't ring particularly true; but if Hollywood fantasy is what you're after, Hytner's romance is as watchable as most others this season."
"There's a lot of really neat, cool honestly imaginative stuff in Magnolia, but it's hardly the best movie I've seen in the past month."
Despite a few classy effects-driven moments it spirals to a rather flat and forgettable ending.
"Colossal has a terrific, almost irresistible metaphor at its core, and it's really a shame the movie doesn't much know what to do with it."
"In this case, boredom is the deadliest sin."
It sort of sits in a blank&#44; defeated slump&#46;
Moves from static moment to static moment but struggles to make a connection.
Nothing in A Mighty Heart conveys the magnanimity of its title.
Each heart-tuggingly placed Beatles tune and life-affirming moment of triumph pats us on the back just for sitting through such a socially responsible film.
"It ambles along uncertainly, hobbled by the lack of chemistry between its two lead actors, and by gags that either try too hard or suffer from being barely there."
"leaves a sour aftertaste: It's too little, too soon. ...even accomplished actors, sensitive screenwriting and impressive visual effects can't compete with the heartbreaking horror of the real world."
"For ""Green Card"" seems much more enjoyable on a second viewing, after the ghost of Julia Roberts in Beverly Hills had been banished."
"Peck...reduces Baldwin's in-the-moment reflections and once-daring insights to the petulance of the Black Lives Matter crusade, which overturns the principles and virtues that King, Malcolm, and Medgar represented before their deaths."
"Even by Bay's incoherent standards, it's one deadening pile-up."
Neeson doesn't even try to convince us of his character's tough persona...he dials in this performance on a rotary phone long distance connected by an operator at a switchboard.
"Talbert sneaks in a few funny one-liners and genuinely touching scenes, but he mostly seems content to keep Montana scurrying through a meaningless maze of boring rom-com cliches."
"Lacking forward motion, Space Chimps turns itself in circles."
The physical spark between the two shaggy blondes that made How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days the perfect airplane movie is 20 fathoms under sea.
"It's such early-20s melodrama, but in a way it fits perfectly into a world in which people are drunk all the time, grow hipster beards, and talk to each other like this: ""Dude, what's up?"" ""Nothing, what's up? Dude."""
It never finds that level of the fantastic or allows for the kind of magical thinking necessary to escape its dreary reality. Ultimately it wallows in the pathetic. Who needs this?
A dreadful trudge through dodgy horror clichés.
"Acknowledging the fact that you're a tedious, self-indulgent storyteller doesn't excuse the fact that you're a tedious, self-indulgent storyteller."
"It's a wonder that nobody has tackled the story of the civil-rights crusader on the big screen before, which makes this effort discouraging for its lack of depth or insight beyond the basics."
"This doc about a young Internet sensation goes for cutesiness at every turn and resultingly comes off as pure fluff, despite its subject's obvious relevance and intelligence."
"Moebius gains full marks in the ""hard-to-stomach"" category for bonkers Korean auteur Kim Ki Duk."
What was deeply moving on the printed page seems mechanically melodramatic when dramatized in Derek Cianfrance's film. You want to be moved but can't shake the feeling that mostly you're being manipulated.
"With the supremely evil Valdemort having put in an appearance at the end of the previous film, you might think it would be time to circle the wagons and start planning some defensive strategies ... but you would be wrong."
"Initially astonishing, overly complicated, increasingly incoherent, and ultimately silly ..."
Mrs. Hoffs should not make jokes about film making.
"Like a sputtering career, Ellie Parker pretty much goes nowhere, and it's difficult to imagine that it would be of interest to many beyond the Hollywood community."
"Only ever remains skin deep; the filmic equivalent of reading from the prayer book and listening to the sermon, rather than interrogating and internalising the words contained within."
The movie is attempting to make a statement and it won't stop until you are aware of its statement.
"The consistently negative study of Hoover, along with pell-mell story telling and a melodramatic and silly gay romance, make J. Edgar a disappointing film."
"The film, without a fresh or un-borrowed idea in its head, is exhausted before it begins."
"Written in a boardroom, produced in a lab."
The solid cast and craft on display make it all the more disappointing that this introduction of a new voice on the horror scene doesn't have quite enough to say.
For the most part this film is very manipulative with how it's trying to tug at your feelings. Most are going to call this one of the best films of the season or year but while this picture is executed superbly it's not really earned its heart one bit.
"As overproduced as a Super Bowl soft-drink commercial, so much so that even its potentially insightful moments seem like movie fakery."
Slimy
"Efron and co-star Vanessa Hudgens have charm. But director Kenny Ortega buries them in formula dances, forgettable tunes and dialogue that makes Grease sound like Greek tragedy."
Perhaps the sole reason to see this film is to pay final tribute to Aaliyah. Too bad it isn't a better movie.
"Mangold went to so much trouble to give Stallone a good role, but he forgot to write good parts for Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Ray Liotta, Annabella Sciorra and Cathy Moriarity."
Candy-coated feel-goodery dressed up as historic disaster porn.
"Although [the] sequel doesn't reach the bar set by its predecessor, it comes close at times."
Nothing in the story really sticks; amid endless iterations of AA meetings ... it's left to Callahan's scabrous cartoons to remind us just how dark his humour was.
"Honestly, you could search for answers within this film, but you won't find it - the plot is the equivalent of a Where's Wally joke."
"Watching Limelight, about the rise and politically engineered fall of onetime Manhattan nightclub kingpin Peter Gatien, is like looking through a family album: If you're in the family, you might be interested."
"Melancholic music and a torpid pace don't make In Bruges profound, but they are symptomatic of this phony, pretentious crime film's schizophrenia."
"Even the destruction, the ostensible reason for the film's whole existence, is surprisingly dull."
"The heart knows what it wants in Bread And Tulips, and so do the filmmakers. Every eccentric character, plot-twist and contrivance is a means to that end."
"About as enjoyable, I would imagine, as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces...positively dreadful."
It takes a heap of loafing to make a Western film so dull you even lose interest in watching the horses and the stunt men doing their stuff.
"By the time the final act unleashes its revelations and peril, ""Haunt"" has felt more like an exercise in formal spookiness than a full-blooded story of lingering malevolence."
Short on real insight.
"The sight of Posey, Minnelli, and Graham fondling sexual aids and chattering about orgasms is meant to reduce you to helpless laughter, but it will more likely leave you wondering how many bad choices it takes to destroy a career."
"The dialogue and background music sound hollow, as if they had been recorded in an empty swimming pool, and the wobbly camera seems to have a fetishist's interest in hands."
"Braff got the casting right, if little else."
"A sentimental sibling reunion saga encased in a cascade of gross-out jokes and occasionally bright one-liners, The Brothers Grimsby is a treat only for die-hard Sacha Baron Cohen fans."
A Robert Ludlum-esque spy thriller that is more interested in dodging offending anyone&#8217;s politics than telling a coherent story&#44; The Gray Man is perfectly mediocre entertainment because no single aspect is good enough to recommend&#46; 
The problems with the effects reflect the problems with the film at large&#44; in which the clashing tones manifest a wannabe goofy&#44; gnarly genre picture that won&#8217;t put in any of the work to make it so&#46;
"An iconic musical that hasn't aged well, once you get past the (overlong) dance numbers Funny Face is like a great beauty with no personality."
"If the story had stuck to its guns as a political thriller, it would have been fantastic. However, the sideline story of a codependent lover made things screech to a halt."
"Friends may not let friends die alone, but bogus philosophizing is apparently business as usual."
"The ""based-on-a-true-story"" tearjerker ""Joe Bell"" is a movie with its heart in the right place, but wrong in so many particulars - most notably the straining-for-Oscar casting of Mark Wahlberg in the title role."
"It's like some sort of patriotic, eye-opening acid trip. These hard-working kids deserve to win, goddammit! You know what they really deserve? A movie of their own."
"The first third of the film is powerful and moving. The second third is dramatic, but the final third is so corny it almost makes one forget what Beyond Borders could and should have achieved."
"Rather than settling into an agreeably amusing groove, the picture spends most of its 98 minutes flitting around trying various romantic comedy guises on for size at the expense of pacing."
"Not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh, groan and hiss at."
"For a narrative that's positively overflowing with dramatic intrigue, Elizabeth: The Golden Age is only fitfully compelling."
This is a throwback to those disreputable 70s comedies that found a spot for every unemployed layabout in Hollywood.
"The actors are forced to labor through such laughable lines as: 'Love is not a race,' 'You don't dance, you float' and other whoppers no sensible girl would buy for a second."
Guy Ritchie's live-action remake is content to trace the original's narrative beats with perfunctory indifference.
"Let the great, dumb, pointless debate rage on."
Tepid romance and sluggish action can't match the beauty of Venice.
This crime thriller's script plays more like an early draft that still lacks the nuts 'n' bolts crime and nervy thrills
One of the worst Bond films to come along in years.
"It flounders from one absurdity to another, with results that are hilarious when they aren't insulting. There is as much political realism in the film as there is in Naked Gun 2 1/2, except that in Patriot Games it matters."
"Many ambitious moviemakers have recklessly tread on John Carpenter's seriously hallowed ground anointed by the raving screen maniac's many fans, and found themselves sorely lacking."
Washington and Wahlberg excel at doing the buddy movie bit. If only they were doing so in a better film. (Full Parental Review also available)
"A sorry little excuse of a film created to advertise Pepsi products, Queen Latifah's spin-off movie, and to exploit the success of the first Barbershop."
"Instead of evolving into intriguing lunacy, ""The Lovers"" loses a critical battle with coherency."
"Should be like a 'Shirley Valentine' sequel, but falls a little flat."
"A handful of sparky leads can't help this superhero reboot find an appropriate tone. No no, Power Rangers."
"While it waivers with what kind of film it wants to be, 12 Hour Shift also struggles with how scenes flowed. The acting sometimes felt stifled and stunted, possibly due to problems with the script or how the actors fed off or interacted with each other."
"This is hobbit cordial, one part juice to nine parts water."
Class. That's not what you get from a Rugrats movie.
"Perhaps El Cantante will inspire viewers to seek out recordings by Lavoe, who died in 1993 after battles with AIDS and addiction. They probably explain his legendary status much better than the film does."
"Despite committed performances, The Voices can never transcend the inherent problems in its screenplay."
"Take the Lead is one of those inspiring teachers in the 'hood tales. And it's 'inspired by a true story,' which translated means 'as Hollywood cornball as humanly possible.'"
The film's target audience... is going to largely be much too young to have any first-hand experience with the James Bond tropes being satirised.
"A stylish, consistently diverting romantic caper that, nonetheless, leaves you feeling that you've been jerked around without sufficient payoff."
"A road movie with a lofty message that too frequently gets lost in its own thematic barrens. Whereas Krakauer's disturbing book sticks with you, Penn's movie, wrapped in the balloon of its fanciful rhetoric, just floats off."
"It proceeds so deliberately from one plot point to the next that we want to stand next to the camera, holding up cards upon which we have lettered clues and suggestions."
"Just when it seemed like Mr. Spielberg might be maturing into a filmmaker with some much-needed cynicism, you realize he's still just out there rounding up the dollars."
"Similar to his last film, Personal Shopper, Non-Fiction isn't awful. It's just aloof, sterile and unimpressive. Audiences and fans looking for another emotionally-charged [Olivier] Assayas film will just have to wait."
"... predictable, unremarkable and overly familiar."
If Oz the Great and Powerful only had a brain. And heart. And courage.
"It plays like a very long TV show and might even remind old-timers of the '50s-era ""Adventures of Superman."" That's the laughable series in which no one ever recognized George Reeves after he showed up as Clark Kent as soon as his alter ego flew away."

So mundane and void of tension or fear Shyamalan appears to have directed the film via fax&#46;
"Cheesy, vapid, contrived, and shallow..."
The fact this is out in the same week as the fluffy owl movie beggars belief. It doesn't even belong in the same ruddy century.
Don't hate El Crimen del Padre Amaro because it's anti-Catholic. Hate it because it's lousy.
This is supposed to be the start of a new universe...I don't know what you're supposed to do after this.
"Ferrell and company do their best to summon up the levels of overacting that are the charming hallmark of telenovelas, but the forced parody pulls you out of that mindset time and again"
"Never hinting at the wit or philosophizing of the Pooh stories, the film mostly makes Milne look like an inexpressive hack."
"Box-office commodity Adam Sandler is repositioned as kid-friendly in Bedtime Stories, a Disney movie that plays better on a balance sheet than a screen."
"Alas, a great deal of rather obvious dramatic hoo-ha has been added in an attempt to embellish the material for the big screen."
An ultimately unsatisfying yet passable from a cast capable of and likely expecting so much more.
"Although Love Wedding Repeat's committed cast find haphazard humour in their character's plight, they are hampered by a torpid storyline and a string of threadbare gags."
"Like so many other CGI behemoths, this dull action fantasy ultimately squashes rather than inspires one's sense of wonder."
"All of the pieces are here for one hell of an exercise in genre, style, and fun, but they just don't gel."
"A promising taste of Emma Mackey’s potential as a French-language film star, but little else."
"This is, I know, a self-aware film: its clichés are parodies of horror clichés generally, but to subvert a form, it should, first and foremost, work as an entertainment, and it most surely does not."
"Dark Fate is neither the best nor worst of the sequels; it's a hollow blockbuster masking itself as a gritty and thoughtful continuation of the story. You can open with footage from Linda Hamilton in T2 all you want, but that mask dissolves quick"
"An incoherent mess that jumps from one unlikely, brainless, crash-bang situation to another."
"Sure, it has something to say about power, totalitarianism and the legacy of violence - but it is about as subtle as a penis through the eye-socket, raping our eyes with its unpleasantness far more than it ever engages with our brains."
"Sitcomish, stereotypical and sporadically funny."
"Jason Schwartzman's off-kilter, idiosyncratic screen presence and line delivery can be just as much of a hindrance as an asset."
"Spalding Gray's new film, ""And Everything Is Going Fine,"" is 89 minutes long. What a coincidence! That's exactly 89 more minutes of Spalding Gray than I can stand."
"As the movie winds on, we hear talk of a mysterious character called Georgie, and a deadly conspiracy, and pretty soon the picture devolves into an exercise in racing and chasing and predictable blam-blam-kapow."
"Watching this unspeakably rubbish teen romcom is, to quote David Lodge's classic description of National Service, like a punishment for a crime you can't remember committing."
An efficient home-for-Christmas ensemble comedy trimmed with plastic teardrops.
Nothing here impresses although some sympathy must be extended towards the protagonists of this story. [Full Review in Spanish]
"As with 99pc of horror outings, Suspiria unravels in its final acts into a wheezing farce. A bit of a missed opportunity, you feel."
"The Boss Baby is at its most enjoyable when viewers, like Tim himself, have to figure out what is real and what is make believe. If Alec Baldwin delivers a PowerPoint presentation of dull material, it's still dull."
"The film quickly devolves into a contemptible, exploitative presentation of sociological matters."
"i diahroniki aksia toy eksogiini eisboli synepagetai pagkosmia eirini, ependyetai me epideiksimania sti fotografia kai to montaz, stin prospatheia na kalyfthei ena senario poy otan ftanei sto zoymi, mporei na leitoyrgisei mono an sta symptomata toy ioy ei"
"Unfortunately, for all its social relevance and good intentions, Trafficked mainly proves that university professors don't make the best screenwriters."
"It's a nice crying jag by Natalie Portman, but there's not much else here to recommend."
"An overly long adventure that, with some tinkering and editing, could have been more akin to such classics as The Crimson Pirate rather than just a reminder that they exist."
"If your humour tastes are slightly more refined than a 16-year-old's, you're going to feel like you went 12 rounds with a couple of infantile jokesters."
"As predictable as the outcome of a Globetrotters-Generals game, Juwanna Mann is even more ludicrous than you'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre, and a personal low for everyone involved."
"After delivering a movie whose logic was so muddled and whose imagination was so hamstrung by basic characters and nonsensical plotting, that final scene feels like a real slap in the face."
"This psychosexual thriller indulges in titillating costumes and taboo role-playing ... but ultimately punishes anyone who derives pleasure from foreplay, fantasy, or coitus."
Plagued by Andrew Lloyd Weber's hideous and already dated musical score (parts of it sound like 1980s hair metal).
"Sounds like it should be a blast. Why, then, is the reality about as fun as chewing on a hand grenade?"
The film features a fascinating premise that unfortunately wears thin over the course of its feature-length running time.
"Melinda returns Woody Allen to more steady ground; yet, his film still feels like a work completed with one eye closed."
"You really have to hate logic, party girls and evil German doctors to dig this excruciatingly stupid movie, whose main gag is creating a surgically linked chain of disbelieving adults."
"Jeepers Creepers is no big-screen keeper, but it does survive its 40-minute test drive before turning into a lemon."
A stylish Hollywood remake of the Japanese horror sensation that unfortunately has little personality of its own.
Plays like a parody of hopelessly twee indie romance cliches
"An overextended treatment of a pretty threadbare premise, told with a sense of self-importance the story doesn't warrant."
"The laziest kind of comedy, and a waste of time for everyone involved, including the audience."
"Has moments of sparkle, but the screenplay disappoints and the luminous Rachel McAdams overdoes it."
"Although there are elements of universality in this story of a man shielded from reality, it's difficult to feel much pity for this poor little rich boy."
"An almost perfect recreation of the HBO series - just a little bigger, longer and more desperate to justify its existence."
The film should be pleasing to the converted fans of Vaughn and Favreau...
With a premise that is eerily similar to the tragic events of 9/11...it wavers somewhere on the disappointing line of emotional sterility.
"Whenever Channing Tatum, Jenna Dewan and the rest of the spry young cast start moving, the film springs to life, and when they start talking, 'Step Up' collapses in a heap, like a dancer's discarded sweatshirt."
"[A] far-fetched, mostly unfunny comedy."
"This is something special, even among its ilk. Frighteningly bad."
"I had no sympathy for the charcters. They are, at their core, wretched people who deserve to have their relationship fall apart."
Audiences will identify more with Sydney White's misfit cast than its bland leading lady.
"while this overt genre playground may accommodate all manner of film references and cliches, Maury and Bustillo quickly lose their way, remembering all the by-numbers slash and dash but forgetting any point that they might have been trying to make."
"It leaves too many unanswered threads, attempting to at once demystify the creator and preserve the mystery around the creations that dominated his public persona."
A movie filled with dumb moments.
This crass comedy smells like kitty litter.
An energetic and sometimes quite likeable but still ungainly gangster film wrapped around two of the deftest performances to hit theatres this year.
Bond has lost his charm and there seems little chance for amelioration.
A powerful thought contained in a project that can't quite spotlight the ugliness it truly needs to
"If someone like Jackson could only manage mediocrity, one shudders to think what a less talented filmmaker would have produced."
A god awful violent fantasy that glorifies the lifestyle.
"There's always something to distract the eye but it's an increasingly empty exercise, confirming suspicions that it's simply impossible to translate Fitzgerald's jewell-like prose to the big screen."
"A little more ""Kissing"" like this, and years from now it's quite possible ""Friends"" will be all Schwimmer is remembered for."
The screenplay for Those Who Wish Me Dead feels like the outline for a story filled with much more potential.
"Wasp Network, despite Penelope Cruz's Queen Bee performance, doesn't have the necessary sting."
Will the next terror-minded remake involve a possessed telegraph machine or a grudge-minded ox and cart? Neither option could be any lamer than the shock-free Shutter.
"anything, all it proved was the accuracy of one of the words in the title, for surviving this movie is far and away the biggest test a person could face."
"After many meticulously drawn connections, it's a disappointment to see most of our two-plus hours of careful attention thrown away."
It cant help but feel like Old Man Allen shaking his fist at kids today. 
The premise is pretty much the same: Mess with Neeson's loved ones and you will die.
"Never has an underdog film been so boring, trite, and wholly uninspiring."
"A thoroughly pretentious and tiresome feature, lumbered with a plot that makes the average porn film look like Doctor Zhivago."
Connie Nielsen has an inconsistent southern accent that will grate on your nerves.
Fancy a real downer? [Leigh] lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race.
"Visionaries often lose their way in their own visions. The majority of moviemakers and movies stick to outdated, predictable formulas and conventions. The Wachowskis, on the other hand, are not afraid to strand you early and often in Jupiter Ascending."
The key moments in Page's life have been perfunctorily checked-off and assembled into cut-and-paste scenes at the expense of developed characters and any real sense of motivation.
Best-ever depictions of artificial intelligence in the movies: the cyborgs and androids of 'Blade Runner.' Transcend 'Transcendence' by watching 'Blade Runner' on Blu-ray.
Do yourself a favor and unsubscribe.
Gerwig actually gives her insufferable character some verve -- the actress has potential -- but the remainder of the movie is a slice of life that doesn't much show much life.
"The Hallmark glow is appropriate, for this River is no Depression documentary; it is a fantasy of domestic integrity, where the spirit of Walker Evans surrenders to the sentiment of Walt Disney."
"A drama with little dialogue, lots of music and too much screaming, 
and bogged down by Penn's directorial toolbox... full of commonplace American indie clichés from the last three decades. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Sopranos creator David Chase returns to New Jersey, but his film loses its way"
"While nothing about Unknown is exceptional, most of it isn't bad - it just pretends to a moral and intellectual sophistication it simply doesn't have."
"Teen sitcom-level dialogue, wooden acting, snogging-in-the-rain flashbacks and ludicrously chrome-plated alien racecars."
This indie tween friendship drama shows early potential&#44; but the uneven tone and unrealistic plot twists dampen its impact&#46;
"After being burned in effigy for 400 years, you'd think Guy Fawkes would appreciate a little rehabilitation, but he could hardly approve of the way the Wachowskis have done it."
All the director&#8217;s themes are at play in Passion&#58; obsession&#44; voyeurism&#44; eroticism&#44; murder&#44; and the warped mind of a killer&#8212;they&#8217;re all present&#46; But they never come alive in the sensational way they do in his best films&#46;
In many ways this is all too tidy.
The movie is embarrassingly bad.
"Most of the nice, more-central-to-the-plot characters are very bland, while Turuleca herself is an emphatically hideous creation."
"It is neither for nor by us, on either side of the Cuba-U.S. divide, but from another outside perspective entirely."
"Ultimately, it's oddly conservative fare; well played, handsomely mounted, but as inert as the books that its protagonists blithely hurl from the shelves."
"How desperate is Columbus if his creepy spiders look, act, and sound just like the Eight Legged Freaks"
"The script is scrupulously even-handed, but Garcia can't seem to get a grip on this sprawl."
"This modern-day, teen-centric take on W. W. Jacobs' classic horror story The Monkey's Paw is a not-scary dud that suffers from both uninspired scares ad extremely shallow, annoying characters."
"If Jarmusch is bringing together the people he loves, it's evidently to say goodbye. The world comes to an end in this zombie-movie mash-up, and so does his filmmaking, which disappears up its own meta."
What rolls out the gate as a hot paced sci-fi thriller is really a profile of mental illness disingenuously dressed up as something it's not.
The biggest sin committed by Flatliners is its complete and utter dullness. It's the cinematic equivalent of drying paint.
Not much comedy. Even less redemption.
"The film makes its case well. The problem, though, is it seems a bit late."
"This is art imitating a fantasy about life, made with the hope that life will eventually catch up with art."
"A cheesy B-movie that's initially refreshing, funny and a guilty pleasure, but eventually sinks into tedium while its comic energy and imagination concurrently diminish."
"Messy, derivative, and silly, The Cave is, at the very least, oddly likable."
"All this prurient dissembling has a way of getting on one's nerves, as do the movie's numbingly repetitive string score and its stubborn refusal to come to a prompt conclusion."
"Let me begin by saying something nice about Cameron Crowe&rsquo;s We Bought a Zoo: kids will probably like it. Okay, that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got."
"The repetitious plot is more ritual than text as we watch yet another Liam Neeson avenger defy the will of younger, unscrupulous men."
"The real shame of this deeply flawed picture is that it promises so much, then sacrifices the stark, complex interplay of global power and self-interest on the altar of sloppy emotional machinations and the pop-psych grail of closure."
"It's lazy, it's unfunny and it's a good thing critics didn't get to review Holmes and Watson before the end of the year: Worst Movie of 2018? Elementary, my dear Watson."
The cast is overdressed and underworked.
"The slow pacing actively hurts the story, the information feels scattered, and there's lots of contemplative scenes that could easily have been cut. [Full review in Spanish]"
"This is a dumb movie about people who are allegedly smart, and it was an aggravating experience to watch."
"In this surprisingly conventional biopic, the unremarkable young John Lennon seems as likely to become Peter Noone or Gerry Marsden as the second coming of Elvis."
"The ensemble structure of 'Bobby' becomes problematic, because some the stories are clumsy and dull."
This is the kind of not great/not terrible picture that will work better on a casual home viewing than as a big screen experience.
"Martyr's Lane has all the makings of a truly creepy and terrifying horror flick, however, it takes a bit too long to get there to make it worth the time."
"As we reach the conclusion of After the Wedding, the end of the film seems to have lost touch with the beginning."
It makes the Star Wars mythos play like Pong.
But what does it all mean?
"The good news? Now that all of the tedious exposition has been gotten, glacially, out of the way, ""Part II"" will probably be terrific."
"Whatever shrewdness or charm Sedgwick possessed that caused people to believe that she was a revolutionary figure in New York night life, it doesn't come through in this movie."
"A real clunker. A well-made, thoughtful, well-acted clunker, but a clunker nonetheless."
"Will Ryan get signed by the majors? Will he win Tenley's heart? If you're even wondering, this movie's for you."
"What we've been given is no more than a reasonable facsimile, an honorable attempt at filming an unfilmable book."
a stereopticon of a post-modern morality tale that can't overcome its own inertia.
[Starts] off like a B-version of Sweet Smell of Success before ending like a C-version of The Parallax View.
Stick Robin Williams in his Mrs. Doubtfire dress and have him join the cast of General Hospital and you'd have Madea Goes to Jail.
"The film is somehow both over-plotted and yet completely lacking in story and the action just too disjointed to work. I still want a sequel, and that's because Optimus Prime riding on a Dinobot is really freaking awesome."
"For all its doomsaying, the movie fails to scare you into being a better citizen of the earth or even a riveted moviegoer."
"Coogan gets in some funny line readings from time to time, but there's too much emphasis on his likeability for him to be truly funny."
"Understatement is a quintessential British trait, but it must be used cautiously."
"Its mishmash of murders, thefts and adorable lovers' quarrels turns out to be boring, frankly."
"The film only comes alive with archival footage of the HUAC hearings and interviews with Trumbo himself. When the letter-readers come on, it slows to a snails-pace."
A slavery era-set film that maybe didn’t want or need to be set then.
"I ""get"" grind-schlock. This isn't that, this is someone doing a bad impression of that."
A Hollywood formula flick with the life sucked out of it.
"Radium Girls is not so much a bore, but more of a scattershot missed opportunity to tell an important story"
Guts most of the edgy features of the novel.
"A psychological thriller/cum horror tale about a dangerous fellow with three personalities, a movie that proves Robert Louis Stevenson right: two are fine, more's a crowd."
A Tina Fey movie that may as well be about Liz Lemon [with] neither the wit nor the comic and emotional surprise of an average 30 Rock episode.
Don't come here for a stylised period drama that glosses over either the class gap or her mental health.
"It is based on a video game, and as such, it exists merely to go from one life-or-death scenario to the next."
More troubling is the mixed message the film contends is progressive feminism&#46; There&#8217;s no denying the porn industry objectifies women&#46; Here the message is that there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that&#44; as long as you objectify yourself&#46;
"Not an abject failure, but still, not a film that recognizes its own strengths. At its best, it aspires to two dimensions. Three dimensions is far beyond its grasp."
"Suicide Squad isn't exactly the movie that audiences are hoping for, and not the bounce-back that the series needed after Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice."
"A ham-fisted, under-imagined dialectic on race relations."
"It's hard to say which is more nauseating, the movie itself or the cloying reviews that suggest your mom will just love it, especially with a nice glass of chardonnay."
"More and more frequent attacks by the brain-sucking outer space invaders... don't come so much as frights or thrills as they do a form of relief; as long as the mayhem's going on, we're spared the dialogue."
"While Scholl's virtuous life makes her eminently worthy of her own biopic, it doesn't necessarily make her the most interesting subject for a movie."
"It's all frightfully familiar - as if teens sitting around the campfire need to be told the same story every night - until the last 15 mins., when this Cocoa Puffs movie reveals an underlayer of arsenic."
The movie completely goes off the rails.
Feeble comic one-liners and slow pacing combine for a routine fangfest in this remake of the 1985 film.
"Call this schmaltzy romantic drama Nicholas Sparks Lite, and you won't be far off the mark."
"Both Cooper and Stone have been terrific in other films, but based on their strained, cornball efforts here, I would almost gladly never see them again."
Perhaps these choices were doomed as soon as they were put to the page&#44; but in execution&#44; Halloween Ends is laughably stupid&#44; reeking of forced desperation from David Gordon Green to put out something unique and subversive for this final showdown
"A disaster--and not the kind that's fun to watch, either."
"This is plodding, pedestrian, derivative stuff."
"Nuanced supporting performances by Simon Callow and Ciaran Hinds as the parvenus who've just bought the Opera and, especially, Richardson as the sly Giry, can't compensate for the vacuum at the top."
"It has its peaks as it plays out its series of action beats and fight sequences with a comedic flair not typically seen in Mark Wahlberg-Peter Berg team-ups, but it's a movie of mostly valleys as it unfolds trope after trope in the central narrative."
Treats us to half-baked philosophizing along the lines of 'Life is short and ends when you least expect it' or 'People who aren't on TV don't exist.'
"The film has fun lobbing snarky one-liners and outrageous bloodshed at the audience, but on the whole, Violent Night’s big red bag of self-aware tricks is overstuffed. "
Comedic remake of '70s horror movie has sex humor.
"The relentless calamity becomes a grind, offering few insights beyond ones that are obvious in the first half hour."
"Though disappointing content-wise, McCarthy's sophomore feature still demonstrates admirable attention to things that usually suffer in more superficially flashy horror efforts ..."
"Mercifully this isn't as bad as the brain-meltingly awful Sex and the City 2, but expanded to the big screen Entourage feels more featherlight and throwaway than ever."
"Serves up one convention after another, without ever bringing anything particularly exciting to the table."
A thriller about creativity which doesn't display any of its subject matter.
At the movie's core is a mystery that simply isn't even remotely interesting...
"A more deadpan, mock-solemn approach might have lent this concept a veneer of genuine wit. But Neremberg's jokey pastiche plays out in exactly the short-attention-span mode he decries in modern media."
It's much ado about mutton.
"Saved is a 50-50 proposition. While you won't be moved strongly to love it or hate it, you'll wish you could be pushed in some direction."
"The documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads, etc. -- to do the subject matter justice."
"The Kissing Booth 2 is better than its predecessor, but that's not saying much when the characterisation is still weak and the narrative rehashes the generic plot of a YA film."
"A too chaste girls’ night out, wrapping its radical implications in romcom and kids’ film candy floss."
"Diverting on occasion, preposterous in the extreme, and ultimately disposable."
"This half-hearted, obviously obligatory sequel feels labored and twice as long as it really is."
The story is a lurching carnival of budget blasts.
Freaks is yet another case of plot and characters playing second fiddles to an orchestra of visuals.
"They've made ill-conceived additions and misguided revisions. In the process, they've managed to subtract doubly from the original."
"Outside the Wire is too long, too impenetrable, and not fun enough to warrant its lofty man vs. machine gimmick."
... lacks any hint of humor and no one seems interested in naturally performing the overwritten dialogues. [Full review in Spanish]
What still eludes Burton is the ability to deepen the superficial allure of his visions.
"The movie's not helped at all by Ryder, who seems uncomfortable playing femme fatale to these grimy-fingered boys, as if she doesn't believe anyone could feel this adulative about her."
"Fracture has some involving moments and bright ideas, but it's such a pedestrian execution that it could have just as easily been made as a TV movie with Mark-Paul Gosselaar and Kelsey Grammer."
"Parkhill flips on the plot twist machine, and Dot the I becomes excruciatingly ridiculous in a multitude of ways."
"If there's a police code it merits, it's a ""10-22"": ""Disregard."""
"A pet project padded out to feature-length, bromance-meets-romance predictability. The story beats are so obvious they seem tapped out on a telegraph. If you want to see a Boston bruin who was truly interesting, watch a documentary about Bobby Orr."
"As much as these wonderful actors invest their performances with psychological nuance, their efforts go mostly for naught in a movie that gives character development a distant back seat to the grinding mechanics of its formulaic plot."
"As it stands, Shirley fails to fully capture Jackson's brilliance -- or even Moss's -- even as it attempts to echo the style of one of her shadowy stories, but if it inspires greater interest in the author and the filmmaker, I'd call that a win."
There is nothing remotely funny in this idiotic film. It's not a coincidence that MGM and Columbia waited until the dead of winter to release this bomb.
"As a travelogue the film has air. As a major motion picture, The Eagle doesn't fly."
I'll take Manhattan.
"The early going is interesting, amusing and even clever, but such cinematic niceties give way to a disappointing second hour."

And you thought Twilight was bad...
"I give credit to ""Trial by Fire"" for making a compelling case against capital punishment and the two lead performances by Jack O'Connell and Laura Dern are noteworthy, but the lazy approach to the material undermines the overall emotional impact."
"Of all potential careers, this one seems particularly ill-suited to canine ambitions, and a smarter film might have allowed Enzo to question why his owner insists on taking laps in the hardest, costliest, loudest manner imaginable."
Theres also something cute about Lopez using Marry Me to comment on the circus her own love life has been on social media and in the tabloids.
Many will talk about Peter Berg's problematic jingoism but not enough will be written about how Mile 22 - on its own merits - is a laughably bad film.
"A hugely overegged pudding of a film. It's an indulgent, complacent family comedy-drama."
As well done as the set pieces are... they can't hide how little the characters have been developed.
...plays like somebody spliced random moments of a Chris Rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller.
"This is not good. Formulaic, predictable and at times incredibly boring. Stiffly-acted, with character motivations being completely unreasonable and insane."
"When Unfinished Business loses itself to its own madness, there is the sense that its inherent weirdness is on the verge of coalescing into something big, brilliant and spectacular. But that never happens."
"The most remarkable thing about Sex Tape is how unsexy it is, apart from being completely unfunny, uninteresting and uninspired."
"The first book of Suzanne Collins's prodigiously popular trilogy has been brought to the screen with a Jumbotron sensibility, a shaky camera to emphasize the action and a shakier grip on the subject's emotional core."
This one is a noble failure.
"It's white-lace porn for girls of every age, and the way that it revels in that get-me-to-the-altar mood, to the point of making anyone who isn't getting married feel like a loser, is the picture's key selling point."
"Buried somewhere within the glacial 2-hour runtime is a tense, pacy 90-minute thrill-ride."
"Has all the mechanized ingenuity of one of those dazzling Tripods, but the bigger they are....it's the gutless ending that renders War of the Worlds most insulting."
McConaughney plays the role of dashing adventurer Dirk Pitt as if he were a party-hardy frat boy who ventured out into the real world after all campus kegs were tapped dry.
"The only two onscreen items with any star quality belong to Simpson, and they're barely contained in shirts that seem to be holding on for dear life."
"It's the usual case of great dancing, bad acting and even worse dialogue in this very guilty pleasure for fans of the genre."
"Lawrence and Christian have the luxury of more time to explore [the story], but instead they merely add several external, superficial elements that misunderstand and circumvent the story's center."
"In the opening scene, an unnamed narrator claims Lester is, ""a child of God much like yourself perhaps."" If this is true, jokes on us because only Satan could spawn a man like Lester Ballard."
"It's the kind of film where everything slavishly services the plot, even the most throwaway of comments will ultimately come into play."
"...an unsatisfying, frivolous, insubstantial look at someone whom some think of as an American idol."
"This failed attempt at a horror comedy is one of those rare movies with virtually nothing to recommend it. I only note it here as a consumer service for those who might be misled into expecting it to be scary or funny, or both. It's not."
"Re-edited in the wake of the Aurora massacre, the film definitely misses its excised Grauman's Chinese Theatre shootout, which might have helped justify its movie-obsessed unreality."
"The movie ultimately feels innocuous, hitting too few emotionally provocative notes."
"Pretentious, indulgent, tiresome exercise in star-strutting and seediness."
I Care a Lot isn't a film about the criminals you love to hate - it's about the criminals you just plain hate.
"Yes, the appealing mismatched megastars earn their paychecks with game performances. But other than an occasional zinger hitting the mark, laughs are in short supply."
"It's almost like the script is playing cat-and-mouse with us, and sometimes the broad characters are a little predictable."
This promising satire&#47;comedy&#47;horror movie winds up spreading itself a bit too thin&#44; never fully committing to any of its components&#46; Even its skewering of racism feels blunted&#46; 
"It's a marginally successful attempt to flare up the senses through shocking repetition, but this is Moritz after all, so if you must go, leave your brain at home and sneak in a cocktail to help wash down the nonsense."
"Get Out was brilliant, one of the finest movies of this decade, and I've been a fan of Key and Peele for a long time. But not every album is Revolver."
"Familiarity is the watchword of this overblown opus, which neglects holes in the plot to play up its postmodern theme of identity as pastiche -- a clear case of the pot calling the kettle black."
"The brutality is hard to stomach, the characters are paper thin and unlikeable and the camerawork is often annoyingly shaky."
"The comedy, though, is broad and only mildly effective and the banter lacks edge and wit."
"Although marginally better than Robert De Niro's Hide and Seek, one hope's we can snuff out this sub-genre before someone comes up with a spooky Spotlight or sinister Spin the Bottle."
Worthless.
"While the director seems way off the mark with the suggestion that immigrants lack knowledge of world cuisine, the real failure to succeed in delivering a telling social critique comes down to the lack of enquiry into Ernesto's life."
"If there were truly anything serious, important or intellectual about this movie, this planet would be in big trouble."
"Alice has a crackerjack premise for a film, but the finished project is a huge misstep and a squandered opportunity to do something bold, different, and meaningful."
The deliberate tempo and scarcity of narrative information may test your patience&#44; as it did mine&#44; even as you appreciate Ball&#8217;s evident skill&#44; aesthetic confidence&#44; and commitment to his conceptual intentions&#46;
"But after a few minutes, the movie abruptly switches to full animation, and rather primitive animation, at that. You could practically hear the collective sigh of the audience."
"Easy philosophising and analogies are par for the course in The Guest, which happily plods along with wry comments and melodramatic schemata."
Garbage
"his Grudge is a trudge through muck, meandering plot, half-baked performances, and tired tropes that should've been retired by the end of the 2000s."
How sad to see such luminous so wasted in a film of such utter dreariness as this.
"Nelson Mandela gets the Classics Illustrated treatment with this handsome, undemanding biopic."
&#8230;mocking a bad Xmas film is part of the fun of the holiday&#59; the best that can be said for The Noel Diary is that it fully deserves our derision&#8230;&#46;
The various sleights of hand performed by characters and filmmakers alike come off less as acts of magic and more as the clumsy parlor tricks of results-based filmmaking.
"Escape Room offers a bit of entertainment, but fumbles the ending, resulting in an experience that's not nearly as fun as a real escape room."
"Atmospheric, but shallow, dull and underwhelming."
Little more than a For Your Consideration ad stretched to feature length.
"Even if you haven't seen any of the tell-all television spots, every beat of this crime drama will look and sound familiar."
The two leads have exactly the chemistry you'd expect from really sexy young people who think that it's wicked cool to be paid big bucks to tan and make out.
It's a struggle to genuinely recommend a piece that wants to hurt you so deeply.
"A long drawn-out affair that spends so much time with the living legends Jim Bowie and Davy Crockett that it could be an early Wild West ""Entertainment Tonight."""
It's a barely serviceable police procedural that has a harder time locating persuasive drama than its detectives do tracking down their man.
Almost everything in the film is pretty familiar...
"The plot's a total shambles. The message (rob, pillage and snort your way to a no-consequences happy ending) stinks."
"While impressive enough on a surface level, The Pact gradually reveals itself to be hollow in key areas."
Lapkus embarrasses herself with confidence. Her full-throttle verve transcends the script like a water skier leaping over a Great White.
"The film is pretty long and frankly it feels it, partly because it spends too much time padding out unnecessary individual backstories."
"Crank works overtime to be a disreputable bit of pulp fiction, and for the first half or so it's like inhaling the cinematic equivalent of the film's title."
"Amsterdam might encompass 15 years of history, straddle two continents and throw in innumerable subplots, but it becomes increasingly hard to shake the sense that you’re watching a very thin idea twiddling its thumbs."
"Just when Foxx's vector begins ascending, the rest of the film unfortunately banks over and starts a long slow dead-stick glide."
"It's as if they built a portrait of a fascinating female killer and then chickened out, settling into the Lifetime ""men are terrifying"" model instead of exploring something more dynamic."
"...an ill-tempered comedy, relying on misfortune and childishness for its humor."
"How capturing an animal found in every zoo constitutes a scoop is beyond me, but when you expect the trio to be knee-deep in blood they are instead wading through politics."
... a muddled comedy that feels more like a vanity project than a profound examination of upper-middle class family dynamics.
This remake of a South Korean movie ultimately provides fewer scares than the average aging baby boomer feels every time they look into a reflective surface.
You'd have to be more than merely intoxicated to find anything about this dismal stoner comedy remotely funny. You'd have to be unconscious.
"Poltergeist meets The X-Files when an average US suburban family is plunged into horror, blah blah blah."
"Familiary breeds contempt...Unless you think a dog flushed down a toilet is a laugh riot, you're better off leaving these Fockers alone."
What Just Happened spends so much time on the inside of the moviemaking industry that it fails to consider one person outside who might find its story interesting.
"All the ingredients (cliches) of the John Wayne hero are here, from commitment to his job as firefighter to a wife who couldn't accept him to a daughter who affects reconciliation."
"[Ritchie's] latest effort has the sprawling cast of characters and all the convolutions you'd expect, but none of the wit or joy necessary to distract from its shallowness."
I was really looking forward to Mechanic: Resurrection. Shame on me.
"I feel compelled to apologize about laughing at Chuck and Larry, like many Sandler films less a movie than a fistful of funny moments."
This is the kind of vacuous film you could have sworn you saw before and swear you won&apos;t again&#46;
It's the film equivalent of an ice cream cone that's fallen onto the sidewalk and you're watching it melting into the gutter.
"The film, clocking in at just 93 minutes, is not a tough sit by any stretch of the imagination but rather a harmless excuse to pay tribute to a Hollywood legend."
"Stalingrad is long and operatic, but its message is simple enough: War is hell, but hell, it makes for good cinema."
"Such a waste of a talented bunch of actors. And of Balan, who tries hard to invest some feeling into a role which turns into a cliché the moment the film opens."
"The film's bright spot is Q, who has really become a capable, confident, sexy action star. I can't wait to see her in another action movie that is not this one."
The terrible truth is that 'Deadpool' is not worth to disconnect a few hours of reality. Ends up depleting saturation. [Full Review in Spanish]
"The first time you stare into Halle Berry's iris, it's interesting; by the fifth and sixth time it's exasperating."
It's all too arty for its own good.
"Mortdecai is an okay film that will struggle to find a U.S. audience. A character is given a silly mustache to set the tone right away, and the tone in entirety is just that- silly."
"If you pitch your expectations at an all time low, you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce."
"Taking a very serious tone throughout (don't expect many laughs), Tomb Raider may be in need of another reboot."
"This thriller by Jon Avnet is mostly by the numbers, and its surprise ending, though effective, feels somewhat forced."
Nobody plays put-upon quite like Ben Stiller.
"When this stranger calls, you may want to stay on the other line."
"If McGowan pushes the religious themes too hard, his greatest sin is that he leads you to believe that the story is true."
Don't let the studio-manufactured hype fool you; this is a midsummer's matinee bore.
"Saw IV almost makes you believe there are hundreds of rooms out there at this very minute with puppets, tricycles, and audio tapes just waiting for the next game."
Meta musings leave this reviewer cold
"MacGruber is by no means a work of genius, or a piece of art, or even very good. But Forte and company have managed to make crude and lewd dunderheadedness laugh-out-loud funny here and there, and that, I guess, is something of an achievement."
The only thing more tired than a tarted-up movie about junkie codependence starring attractive performers emoting junkie-like is a tarted-up movie about losers in an all-night diner. Broken combines both clichs.
"Proof that Hollywood no longer knows how to make that former staple, the women's picture."
A mechanical exercise from the get-go.
"Hoult is a sharp performer but understandably struggles to find dark humour in cringe-worthy shock jock lines such as: ""This music is the biggest insult to humanity since a roomful of Nazis first cooed over the blueprints for Auschwitz."""
Murky and pretty near incomprehensible.
3-hour borefest.
"Kutcher isn't bad, but this bio-pic doesn't dig deep"
"The problem is the script, adapted from a novel and full of psychological gaps and dead-ends."
I do get it. I just don't like it.
"For a movie set against the backdrop of the Cuban Missile Crisis - a movie that's enameled with the classic tropes of espionage, and builds to a daring international heist at the end of the second act - the whole thing can be rather even-keeled."
The film is draining.
"""Superbad"" with Scouts. And zombies. Lots of laughs, just not quite enough to pay off."
"If you want a movie time trip, the 1960 version is a far smoother ride."
"With Covid-19 sidelining the real Eurovision, Will Ferrell offers a mildly diverting tribute that subs a treacly love story for the nonstop, low-comic lunacy required, except for a jaja ding dong Dan Stevens as an oversexed Russian contender."
I found myself not even giggling.
[T]here is no way to say it without employing a pun -- it leaves a truly bad taste.
"Bulked-up men firing automatic weapons at each other will always appeal to some viewers, but Den's running time of two hours and 20 minutes is way too long."
"While Downey's rumpled insouciance jibes with the movie's jaded, narcissistic tone, it's a hard tone to take for a hundred minutes or so."
Unspoken traffics in suspenseless setups and poltergeist shenanigans we've seen countless times before.
"...the film's critical fans-seem to think he's breaking new ground. He's not, and the resulting film is more disappointing than the hype surrounding it lets on."
Perhaps the most misogynistic film of the decade.
"Ghosts of War does have some surprises up its sleeve, but it doesn't make much out of either the mystical or military material, and will struggle to put the frighteners on hardened horror fans."
A teen movie so inspirational and heartwarming that it comes with its very own lip gloss.
"Golding can carry a movie and he does have decent acting - and action - chops. Having said that, he also deserves a much better star vehicle than this."
"Unloads a volley of plot twists that'll have you slapping your head in disbelief, provided you haven't figured them out by the end of Act I."
Social commentary is laid on so thick and often it becomes muddled.
"Despite good intentions, a positive message and gay lead, it couldn't save a kitten stuck in a tree."
"""Show, don't tell,"" the old saying goes. ""Triple 9"" does neither."
"Just the latest misguided attempt to recycle an old horror classic, replacing suspense and a sense of mystery with splatter movie cliche and heavy-handed backstory."
"The film lacks focus, sharpness."
"Even at 82 minutes, Snatched somehow feels long. It's tired, lazy, generic, insubstantial filmmaking that fails to capitalise on its stars."
"London's never looked so good, yet outside of the crackling action scenes, there's very little on offer."
"Contender for worst film of the year, Tammy is painful. If you are looking for a good laugh, a well-written script, engaging characters, quirky relationships, a story with heart and having a whale of a time, this Melissa McCarthy comedy is not it"
"Yet another iteration of what's become one of the movies' creepiest conventions, in which the developmentally disabled are portrayed with almost supernatural powers to humble, teach and ultimately redeem their mentally ""superior"" friends, family..."
The death scenes are so unimaginative and the gore is so minimal that you might miss it if you blink.
"""Upgrade"" is a compact sci-fi action B-movie that wants to be a hip little genre exercise but doesn't have the chops (or maybe it's just the imagination) to entirely pull it off."
"The ranting, whining, kvetching, self-involved family begins to outstay its welcome [...] so that time spent with them can feel like entrapment at a raucous bar mitzvah reception."
"The film has many awkward moments, scenes that seemed staged and forced."
"A sincere, well-meaning movie, but it's stilted and ponderous, all too representative of the worst failings of simplistic docudrama."
Her movie is indeed ambitious and her goals admirable. But sometimes it seems more position paper than cinema.
"Leder (with an assist from screenwriter Leslie Dixon) bulldozes any and all attempts at nuance in favor of unadulterated bathos, proving once again that good intentions do not equal good filmmaking."
A patronizing response to every question about Queen music that can be answered by either playing a Queen song or showing a clip of a band member discussing a Queen song.
"It turns out that the ""gloriously independent"" Catherine is really little more than Truffaut's idea of a captivating-but-ultimately-evil femininity."
"Guadagnino has made an ambitious homage, but it doesn't really benefit from its more intellectualized gaze, instead draining the stomach-churning thrills of great horror."
"Studded with some funny moments, but comes off as fuzzy and false, owing to the fact that it seems conflicted about what sort of agenda to pursue, or perspective to advance."
This pedestrian thriller plonks poor Liam Neeson back in a leather jacket and armed with a gun for another one of those 'Taken Lite' outings.
"The film is infuriating in its predictability, right down to its poetic but preposterous climax."
"I felt warmly toward Dumbo, but not ""Dumbo."""
Arriaga's attempt with poignant reconnections at the end can't strike the emotional footnote it wants at the fade as he's muddled it up trying to get us to make all the obvious connections from the previous 100 minutes.
"This adaptation of Frances Mayes' largely autobiographical best-seller is so predictable, so familiar, so episodic that it seems to belong on the small screen."
"Despite being visually stunning, it's as dry as hell."
"The film's outrageousness would be more palatable if leavened with more wit, or if the characterizations possessed more nuances."
"It's bold, fleshy and audacious, at least in theory. But it is also numb."
"[""Hereditary""] falters at the finish line. Not only are the last 20 minutes desperate undisciplined, but the actions are screen don't tingle the spine."
Resorts to a clichd and over-the-top ending that negates all of the effective ambiguity that made the middle third of the film so nail-bitingly tense.
For all of its big ideas ... Transcendence ends up lacking when it comes to translating them into a compelling story.
"The climactic bloodletting may make for merry times for fanboys and fetishists, but it's difficult to reconcile Tarantino's infectious joie de vivre with the scorched-earth nihilism he uses it to celebrate."
"Instead of ending, it all just gives up with a sort of ""never mind"" ending that even Mr. Woodcock would have to call a foul on. Indeed, that is the best possible assessment of the movie as a whole."
Skip this one and check Sarah Silverman out on stage for real.
Remarkably redundant.
"o Nicolas Cage na periferei tis ektos eleghoy sapoynoperikes toy moytes kai ti geloia malloyra toy, se ena pompodi poiitikistiko ahtarma, poy bromaei ap' opoy ki an ton piaseis"
"""London Town,"" to borrow from a certain foursome, isn't ""burning with boredom,"" but neither is it exactly ""calling."""
Witless and relentlessly cliched'...this whimsy whoopie cushion of a lame romantic fable is as soggy as a Jackie Collins novel that fell into a jacuzzi.
"A shabby, joyless, 90-minute slab of 'advertainment' designed to sell booster packs for a popular trading-card game."
"This dark comedy is more twisted (and twisty) than it first appears, but as with any family album, it is a few individual scenes that make it memorable rather than the whole, overlong package."
"Talking heads are intercut to synthesise theory and practice, but as an economic diatribe this is a bit patronising and not wholly persuasive."
"Since it teases viewers to the point of frustration, by the time you figure out the secret behind the paranormal happenings, you probably won't care."
"Schrader just seems angry, as if he's using this film as a tinny megaphone for an announcement of his displeasure with a Hollywood that's left him behind."
"Such a heavy-handed approach drains some of the emotional power from its best sequences, including a vivid and bloody depiction of the Crucifixion."
Welcome to the broken city... where honorable anti-heroes with dark pasts can get double-crossed and mixed up with good guys who're really bad guys... where doing the right thing will put you IN TOO DEEP. It's a drag to be here.
A film that is stylish but infuriatingly and unforgivably obtuse.
"Where Dumb And Dumber was clever enough to play dumb to amuse the child in all of us, this suffers under the illusion that just having a central character blissfully unaware of the need for a brain is actually a funny concept."
You almost wonder if the whole thing isn't just one big campy joke.
The superhero part of the movie will leave audiences with a flat feeling.
"Oh my, this is truly embarrassing."
"One may feel dissatisfied by the 11th-hour turn toward lyrical fatalism, and mildly insulted by the presumptuous attitude it seems to choose as it sends us on our way."
"This humorless and nonsensical update of The Manchurian Candidate - a total misread of Frankenheimer's classic original - never quite engages, devolving the original's camp and satire into self-serious melodrama."
"The movie never achieves the sort of transporting fantasy that formed the backbone of the novel: The limitless potential for adventure and excitement that books provide, given physical form when transplanted into our reality."
"Attraction is not comprised of rules, only missed opportunities."
"An incredible cast inexplicably stars in a poorly thought-out, low-budget neo-noir from filmmakers with no clout or even discernible past success. What, were they blackmailed?"
"No, I'll go ahead and sleep NOW, thank you."
So busy jerking tears and ladling on the whimsy that it can't even be bothered to make its leads halfway believable as people.
"It's the less animated moments where ""The Gangster, the Cop, the Devil"" struggles."
"Even film silliness needs a little gravity, beyond good hair and humping."
"The dots are there, but they don't connect."
"REPLICAS can't decide which note it wants to play, so it slams on them all in random order. REPLICAS exists as the kind of movie that raises lots of interesting - if oft-asked - questions and then immediately ditches them."
"Some nice visual perspective from (a sightless) point of view. Lots of pretentious BS, too."
A muddled disaster of conflicting ideas and outright hyperbole.
The movie is dismaying enough; thinking about its huge potential audience is downright terrifying.
Strong material has been wasted by inept filmmaking in Like Water for Chocolate.
"If this is the film that gets Kevin Smith the money to make his Fletch film, then we can chalk it up as a necessary evil. But please someone give him the money so we never have to sit through another Cop Out ever again."
In what church is Heath Ledger a priest? And who are the nuns - Heather Graham and Tara Reid?
Sometimes war is predictable hell.
"[H]umor is so damnably absent from this witless, noxious sludge of a comedy... that one suspects those involved may have worn out their rotator cuffs high-fiving over such an innocuous, caffeine-related pun."
The movie often is phony.
Nothing special.
"It's hard to tell what drew Kasdan to imagine Mumford - the town and the man - since the flimsily whimsical, rambling result never declares its intentions."
"A caper of this type needs tense set pieces, surprising twists, idiosyncratic characters or charismatic stars - ideally, all the above - to distinguish itself, and this one falls short in all those departments."
"Not brilliant, but certainly entertaining. Wahlberg plays his go-to blue-collar good guy with a continued ease, even while being upstaged by Ribisi's and Foster's off-kilter wackadoos."
"To follow up Japn, Reygadas goes even further into Mexican metaphysics ... but he loses us in the process."
"Like if McDonald's did an American version of kimchi and served us ketchup on cabbage. It's not going to please any fans of the original, and you might like it as a separate entity, but probably only if you're desperately hungry and an idiot."
"The best, and possibly only, reason to watch Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian is the enchanting Amy Adams."
"Despite the veneer of vomit-stained raucousness, it's fairly mild stuff ..."
"Some of my fellow critics at a media screening guffawed during the most egregiously syrupy moments, a reaction which paying audiences might well share."
"There's nothing about this lame sequel that wasn't done better the first time around, which makes its brief 88 minute running time feel like an eternity in hyperspace."
"The film features one-dimensional, married characters who lack distinctive personalities, and fails to include a backstory that proves they ever had any chemistry together."
Nostalgia is a wonder and a cheat. The right touchstone can make the most discerning movie-goer forgive a film as lazy as Pixels. Almost.
"Though Curtis Hanson captures the savage swings from high to low, he fails to when it comes to the addictive quality of poker"
Nothing more than an ultra-formulaic Hollywood romantic fantasy grafted onto Belfast.
"The rugged beauty of northwestern New Mexico is proudly on display in ""Beyond the Reach."" But, that's not enough reason to give this silly thriller a viewing."
"The novels are a film franchise waiting to happen. Judging by this film, though, I'd say they'll have to wait a little longer."
"...all of the dialogue in Random Acts of Violence has the feel of bad improvisation; they constantly state what's currently happening and they say ""f***"" a lot."
"James Goldman's screenplay, so chic and sophisticated to the ears of suburbanites, is chock-full of the worst kind of sophomoric fiddling with what Goldman takes to be genuine highfalutin lingo."
"Had it more wits, I'd call it cynical, but it's too lifeless to even be that."
"It wants to keep you guessing, but there are so many twists and turns that I gave up trying to guess."
"The opposite of L.A. Confidential, it's D.O.A. But it does have one good chase scene."
"All the tedium of an endless trans-Atlantic flight gets packed into the 105 minutes of ""Non-Stop,'' a preposterous ""thriller'' providing Oscar winner-turned action star Liam Neeson with his latest paycheck job."
One of the worst films of 2018.
"Its single best scene...comes courtesy of the vastly superior, similarly themed, thirty minute UK animation, ""The Snowman."""
Ultimately&#44; the movie fails at turning a thought experiment into a script&#46;
"The Starling has come out the other side an utterly bizarre, tonal misfire that fumbles through several ideas before implying that it's perfectly OK to berate the suicidal for being so suicidal."
...must this message come via such a bland delivery?
This director is a young dog who needs some new tricks.
It never quite brings everything together into a dramatic whole.
"Imagine 'Hollyoaks' with the gloss taken out, a dash of 'The Exorcist' put in,"
"A lightweight action adventure, derivative in its look and approach. It's strictly for kids, but it's possible to appreciate the picture for what it is."
"Joachim Trier is a Norwegian filmmaker who made a strong debut in 2011, with his film, ""Oslo, August 31."" ""Louder Than Bombs"" is his first English-language effort, and it's disappointing."
"""Blue Like Jazz"" is a pleasant film, as well-intentioned as the character Don himself, but it ducks the thorniest questions of faith and dogma while patting itself on the back for realism."
I can't think of another film in which the embarrassment over a freak bowel movement impedes the course of love and commitment.
"There's nothing so hapless as a movie made in the wrong style, especially when the director doggedly insists on that style to the bitter end."
... doesn't find compelling ways to explore their relationship or establish an emotional connection before a late twist sends the story down the tubes.
The cleverness just isn't there.
"Yeah, girlfriend can out-sing just about anyone in the biz, even Mariah Carey these days, but that's about all that Burlesque is interested in showcasing."
"[White] understands what he's trying to say, but he lacks enough self-awareness to actually stick the landing."
"The best little thing in ""An American Rhapsody"" is the charming performance by Kelly Endresz Banlaki as six-year-old Suzanne."
"After a while, I simply couldn't empathize with Edmond and all his pain and suffering, and certainly not with all his exposed bigotries and delusions."
Brutal and pointless.
"This introduces the worst -- I repeat, worst -- character to be found in any Bond movie."
"The three screenwriters may have been trying to work too many plot strands into two hours; in any case, State of Play is both overstuffed and inconclusive."
...the picture slowly-but-surely wears out its welcome as it progresses into a midsection and second half devoid of wholeheartedly engaging interludes and sequences...
Its meanings are indefensibly shallow and its atmosphere depressingly thin.
"Swimfan, like Fatal Attraction, eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub."
"Tingling jaws notwithstanding, the scariest thing going on here is the realization that this loser got picked up at Sundance."
It's not clear whether Pennebaker understands what it's about-he can only grope for a visual equivalent with cliched shots of overwhelmed fans.
"It seems impossible that such a naf could pull this off, especially when there's a cop (Jason Beghe) who senses something fishy about him early on."
I left not caring what the future held for a single one of these characters.
We get a feeling we've seen it all before.
"There's a storyline involving emperors, chastity belts, and metal plates, but it's slightly confusing and largely nonsensical."
"The gags involve mistaken identity, chases, and various other devices that are borrowed from Ealing but were getting to be clichs in the time of Shakespeare"
"Who would have thought, a Twilight ripoff actually being inferior to its already inferior inspiration."
"Fair Game gets agitated about its subject, but often has trouble inspiring the same outrage in its audience."
The Jane Austen Book Club is an example of how a movie can follow the general plot of a book yet fail to capture the spirit.
"Dolittle is tonally at war with itself, chopped to bits by editing, and discombobulated in ways that are reminiscent of but lack the cult appeal of 2019's Cats."
"Technically handsome, but approximately as deep and lasting as a small parking-lot puddle."
Let's not even get into the awful script or the numbingly awful performances.
The film turns the very real plight of ethnic refugees into fodder for special effects and stunt work.
"It's a tentative, half-realized tale that ultimately suffers from a significant identity crisis."
"A veteran theater director, Rowan Joseph adapted Dalton Trumbo's antiwar novel into an Off Broadway play in 1982. If you're still kicking yourself for missing that production, then this film is for you -- and only you."
"[Heather Graham] needs something to counteract her wholesomeness. In Gray Matters -- her name is Gray, get it? -- what you see is what you get. The fact that her character 'discovers' she is gay is as unbelievable as it is contrived."
"The film is lovely to look at, with cleanly framed, golden-hued widescreen images of desert scenery so evocative you practically taste the dust. It's also a bit dull."
"It's hard to escape the feeling that Will Gluck's follow-up to 2018's Peter Rabbit is straining to capture the fast-paced, meta whimsy of the original while also cramming in a whole bunch of new characters and themes."
"I will not -- I must not -- tell you what happens at the end of this movie, except to say I was stupefied that anyone in modern times (i.e., since 1910) would have the gall to sell such cornball at retail."
The film is so flat and tired it really doesn't deserve the vehemence of this review. It's like chastising a completely airless tire for not rolling.
Seeing [Schilling] and Efron fumble at each other is like watching a stick of butter and a bag of flour not turn into a cake.
"The result is a film that alternates between universality and navel-gazing, with the latter turned irritating and the former too superficial"
"...finishes well before it ends, and not with a bang but with a saddle-sore whimper."
A by-the-numbers action thriller lacking in both action and thrills.
Zellweger exudes none of the warmth and winsome behavior that helped raise the first Bridget Jones film to something solid.
"As in his ""The Fall,"" director Tarsem Singh's visual instincts overwhelm his storytelling finesse."
"It's a gorgeous film to look at, but far too cliched and limitedly-acted to be much better than average."
"More of a remake than a continuation, it provides moderate amusement, but ultimately only for audiences itching for continued massacres from the vengeful, cursed specter."
"This implausible, turgid, suspenseless storyline resists both fine acting and Gray's overwrought MTV chops."
Blood and Chocolate has no audience. Horror fans will be disgusted by the lack of gore. Romance fans will be disgusted by the presence of gore.
"Corben's schlockumentary tries -- and fails miserably -- to rehabilitate the reputation of Peter Gatien, the oft-described ""nightclub king"" of Manhattan in the waning years of the 20th century."
"See with your eyes and Sin City may knock them out. See through them, however, and you'll see how empty these shadowy streets truly are."
"One would wish that the end result of their labors, which is an obvious effort of love, would be better."
"As usual, the talent in Prince of Persia is generally top notch -- from the cinematographer John Seale to the parkour expert David Belle -- but the ingredients have been masticated so heavily the results are mush."
"I have no idea why studio executives think Mann is a go-to-guy for summer fare. He's so serious and so concerned with setting a scene and establishing grit that his movies lack coherency or, far more important, fun."
"Cold-fishy ambivalence isn't the most compelling theme for a romantic comedy. Lost In Translation got away with it through pure quirk, but this one takes its deep thoughts on love far too seriously."
"Daniels' film is an uneven, unsatisfying and poorly assembled lump of a thing. And yet, some of its constituent parts are breathtakingly good. As Holiday, singer Andra Day is surely my personal pick to take home that Academy Award next week."
Would be a **** short.
Plays like an unnecessary revival of the provocative cat and mouse thrillers that were once a speciality of screenwriter Joe Ezterhas.
The movie leaves the audience every bit as numb as the characters are supposed to be.
"The dialogue's so putrid you can smell it, the cast is feeble and the generic sets and effects elicit more laughs than screams."
Emma has all the misplaced seriousness of a documentary on genital warts.
"Exploitative and crass, the film paints an ugly portrait of youth gone wild and the ineffectuality of the police to curb the menace."
There's nothing here that you haven't seen a thousand times before in better-produced movies and TV shows. [Full review in Spanish]
A convoluted&#44; dull and exhausting spy thriller with an intriguing premise&#44; but lackluster execution&#46; If it were part of a double feature&#44; HEAT would be the A-movie and HUNT would be the vastly inferior B-movie&#46;
"Malkovich turns out a murky, listless and eventually pointless film. His attempt at atmosphere dwarfs the barren narrative."
"When a cat, a Stan Lee-filled opening Marvel logo, a fun cameo and making fun of 1990s computer technology steal a movie you know that movie is in deep trouble."
It's Reed's gruff and tuneless delivery that challenges one's enjoyment.
"Snow and Bautista do their best, but they're being asked to play paper-thin people, and any character development invariably gets lost every time the filmmakers decide to embark upon another unbroken take or fancy camera maneuver."
A soulless film that takes the concept of a one-note joke to new heights.
"Clearly, weepie king Sparks is scraping for angsty love story scenarios."
The first chinks in the armour start appearing once you can't even honour your own lore.
"In its attempt to strike a balance between making us laugh and cry, broad comedy and wring-your-heart emotion, the film keeps swaying one way and another, resulting in sudden tonal shifts."
There was no way to re-make The Day The Earth Stood Still properly today.
Despite some solid directorial flourishes from George&#44; a decent initial set up and lead pairing can&#8217;t compensate for a story that limps to a mediocre conclusion&#46;
"The pair have good chemistry, but the film falls apart when Gordon tries (too hard) to turn it into a crime caper."
For the most part [Peter O'Toole] and Sophia Loren as Dulcinea fight the unwinnable fight against the assassins of Cervantes's reputation.
"A twisty tale of inexplicable red herrings, baffling plot detours, and Chloe Sevigny as not one but two identical chicken farmers."
"""The Nun"" could have been many things; instead it's a very bad horror film. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Too cute by half and at least a half-hour too long.
"The adult actors give us something to chew on, but this syrupy film's center is bland."
"Fans who have watched and rewatched the series will be delighted to see all these characters yet again, while non-fans and newcomers will be baffled, bored or both."
"If you didn't know, you'd guess from watching this movie that Williams was just a singer who was popular for awhile before dying young, rather than an icon whose influence reverberated through the decades and far beyond country music."
Showalter's Elliot Sherman gives 40-year-old virgins a bad name (something Steve Carell has done so much to disprove).
"(Director Joe) Wright's cinematic choices, unfortunately, keep viewers at arm's length instead of drawing them into the story."
"There's not much to distinguish it, except, of course, for the bugs. Oh, how marvelously effective the bug scenes are!"
"Director Phillip Noyce has helmed some stand-out films, including Patriot Games, Rabbit-Proof Fence and Salt, but Above Suspicion doesn't pack the same excitement or visceral punch of those stories."
"The Neverending Story may have cost a mint to produce, but the result is bargain-basement."
"Unless you've seen every awful horror flick of the past five years, you won't even get the jokes. A comedic dead zone."
Lucy Fry stands out in this bland vampire ride along that lacks frights and thrills. [Full review in Spanish]
"It's tough to feel pity for a guy who blames everyone else for his misery, and even harder to appreciate filmmakers who encourage his entitlement."
"As a biographical movie, ""Chasing Trane"" sticks to a conventional, dully informative format. Its ideal venue is a Coltrane tribute event or a classroom."
"A ho-hum memory piece that could have used a bit more objectivity, not to mention depth and energy."
It's the so-so script that ultimately makes Bring It On falter.
"What should have been a beautiful, contemplative piece of art, ends up being a self-indulgent bore. You'd be much better off going to your local art museum than sitting through this reject of an art film."
"Hanks is phenomenal, because - outside of those Robert Langdon movies - it's the only gear he has. But it's not enough to elevate a script as generic and derivative as the one here."
Too many scenes are forced and seem out of place.
"Post-Katrina Louisiana and war-torn Africa are little more than special effects generated by life instead of CGI wizards, and the only real curse is on anyone unlucky enough to buy a ticket."
"Something of a roller coaster and fairly bumpy, the ride is the problem here."
"Even with Angelina Jolie thrown in for forensic sex appeal, this dog won't hunt."
"On top of some preposterous and near-fatal plotting errors, Anderson makes the mistake of creating too many characters (supporting stars Graham and Cheadle don't get enough to do, while William H. Macy is wasted for the sake of a punchline)."
Hawke's presence is the only thing that keeps it minimally lit between so many blinks. [Full review in Spanish]
"I can't help but feel that this was another type of film, but someone put his hands on it and it all went to hell. [Full review in Spanish]"
"A scene of emotional redemption, involving a dilapidated carousel being remodelled, may be the most cloying screen sequence in the year to date."
At half its present length it might make an OK midnight camp item.
"Though I found Mr. Yakin's direction unexpectedly imaginative, and the script often incongruously subtle, I couldn't get into the spirit of all the whimsy, the reason being the surprising lack of charm in the two leads."
"The older the pranksters get, the grimmer their stunts feel"
Wedding Crashers meets The Hangover. But in a bad way.
"starts out strong, with an attractive cast and an intriguing premise, but ultimately looses its way due to silly subplots and a muddled ending."
A horrible remake to a classic horror film...
"It means to leave the audience wiping away tears of inspiration, and all we can do is shrug. Been there, done that, not everyone gets a book deal from it."
(Populated with) one- or two-note characters who should be finely tuned instruments in an orchestra devoted to playing the urban blues.
"The young director fails to inject us under the skin of his plotless drama of overdoses and funerals, but he clearly has talent to burn."
"Come Play is a misfire on multiple levels, from the thinly drawn leads to lack of tension. It fails to offer any real scares and it's hard to connect on an emotional level with the characters."
"There's so much flashing forward and backward, so many spins of fate, so many chapters in the journals, that after awhile I felt that I, as well as time, was being jerked around."
"You have to give Mortensen credit though for his uncompromising viewpoint. Still, ""Falling"" is an agonizing watch."
It never justifies its existence... they don't really do anything that improves on the original.
"The movie's deliberate pace, along with some rather strained attempts to build romance out of disaster, winds up sabotaging its aims."
It's by-numbers filmmaking that rarely adds up to anything worth the price of admission.
Jeunet's films more and more resemble Hallmark greetings cards.
"For all the alleged ethical complexity in this thriller's noirish narrative, everything's a little too neat here, from Marlon's ill wife acting as a motivator to the easy disgust generated from showing a room full of 14-year-old hookers."
"From the opening credit sequence using a ridiculous score that sounds more at home in a B-sci-fi film from the 50s to the special effects that were done by the lowest bidder, you know you're going to be in store for something that's sub-par."
"My regretful feeling about this new effort was that - however sincere, unsentimental and heartfelt - Abel Ferrara was not really the director to make a film version of the phenomenon that was Pier Paolo Pasolini."
It's best for everyone if we all just patiently await the release of It and rewatch the first season of Stranger Things.
But it is almost three hours long. And it is so drippy.
"For all Bening's high emoting and her trademark giggle, here overused to the point of annoyance, for most of its length Being Julia offers little insight into a woman whose life is ruled by theatrics."
The story is nothing more than a thin veneer and a poor one at that over a movie to show off the martial arts talents of Jackie Chan.
"The 2019 remake is clumsy, scare-free and devoid of what made the original a classic"
"Kate Winslet does a syrupy voice-over to this bedtime story, but given what we know of foxes, it's a tough one to swallow."
"How ironic that a film intended to celebrate our differences is so bland and poorly animated that it, too, becomes a forgettable face in the crowd."
"A film that can't seem to buy into its own strident message of ""family first,"" possibly because to prove your love, you apparently have to risk the wrath of everyone from your co-op board to PETA."
"Secret Obsession does pretty much exactly what you expect it to, and presumably what you want it to, if you watched the brief preview clip while browsing Netflix and then decided that, yes, you would like to hit play."
"Panoramic yet cozy, enthusiastically glib, Almost Famous suggests a universe of interlocking sitcoms."
"And So It Goes never goes quite far enough, in any direction."
Disney’s remake of its 1940 animated classic Pinocchio is just as bad as you’ve heard.
The movie doesn't really know what to do with the unruly implications it has manufactured.
"Although the series has been an unlikely box-office juggernaut, at this point it seems better suited for streaming, where parents can turn it on for their antsy kids and then safely ignore it."
No one involved in the making of Insurgent would test positive for the intelligent Erudites
"Not very funny, not very sad, not very believable, and not very interesting."
"Despite the bright lights of it all, the progression of the plot fails."
"""...an excruciatingly monotonous plunge through the id of our cultural subconscious, which means that it might even be a decent allegory in spite of itself."""
"While fans might enjoy it or parts thereof, there's just not enough fun, energy or originality to entertain the average viewer."
"Too much pointless violence, too many interchangeable characters, too much cutting in the action scenes, too much earsplitting Dolby stereo, and too many stunts punched up by computer graphics."
"The film's diverse elements might have fared better... if they'd been explored in separate projects, rather than lopsidedly blended together."
This London-set political thriller is a damp squib.
Only the most hardcore Witherspoon fans are likely to enjoy this film.
"Of substance Devils has little, of matter it has much and most of it is lurid for the sake of being lurid."
filmmaking for filmmaking's sake.
"There are questions of exploitation that nag throughout, as well as a queasy feeling that we the audience are participating in exploiting this troubled woman all over again."
"It's hard to believe this shoddy, dishonest mess is Clark's sixth feature film."
"Apparently, some dictionaries don't go past archetype."
John Carpenter's return to horror fizzles.
"Resembles disaster films of the 1970s, where big-name stars battled flood, fire and capsized luxury liners."
"The Marked Ones is a mixed bag that improves upon the narrative of the last two movies, ups the action quotient, but fails to deliver where it really counts - scares."
"Its central concept is flawed to the point of being nonsensical and it will leave many children feeling miserable. Don't try this at home, kids."
"This flabby and blab-infested movie demonstrates once again why Hollywood should stop trying to adapt international egghead blockbusters -- books about books, or about various sorts of twisty antiquarian arcana -- into films."
Rent Dangerous Liaisons and save yourself the trouble.
"It simply feels as if there's a lot more here, beneath the surface and kept there in order to maintain the movie's air of mystery..."
Sometimes this movie feels like a horror picture directed by John Waters.
full review at Movies for the Masses
"The performances are solid throughout, and young Hirose's Suzu is an unassuming delight."
The film's refusal to produce a campy critique feels more like the product of lack of imagination than a purposeful repudiation.
"Like a true romantic, Miller's movie prefers to put its faith in love as a way of rescuing its characters from their existential oblivion. If only the storytelling was as consistently lofty as that sentiment."
Even Freud would find Twisted's connect-the-dots fixation on sex and death overwrought.
"It's a terrible, dumb, unimaginative film that really isn't worth the price of a cinema ticket even with ... the excellent Road Runner short that comes before it."
"Character development and story line, unfortunately, evaporated during the decade of this film's production."
Ayer can match Tarantino's brutality but lacks his humor and finesse.
"Bullock has played this role so many times you wonder why she's bothering. And while McCarthy can be brilliant in small doses, her foul-mouthed tough gal bit wears thin quickly."
No human being possesses the imaginative power to sufficiently lower his or her expectations to anticipate the sheer laziness of this putrid ensemble comedy.
"If there were any more testosterone here, Jose Canseco could have boiled down the screen and injected it."
One to miss.
"Big, dumb and very loud action movies aren't just for the Transformers franchise anymore."
"The frantically foul stuff stands out as the most odious aspect, but it's also a disappointingly facile exploration of female friendship from screenwriter Ellen Rapoport and director LP."
Don't waste your money.
It&#8217;s a bit of a letdown that &#8220;Dragon&#8221; is so squarely aimed at the littles&#44; although its bright animation and simple story might be immensely appealing to them&#44; and certainly lovely enough to look at for older viewers to sit through&#46; 
Even fans of their Cartoon Network series or those simply familiar with the pair via YouTube will likely find the extended version of their pathos-and-pain-driven comedy hard to digest.
Gladiator derides 'entertainment' while hustling like crazy to provide two and a half hours' worth of same. The heroism and the tigers and the epic grandeur all leave behind the flavor of cynicism.
"...devoid of emotional resonance, despite a full-bodied performance by Andy Garcia."
"Good intentions are well and fine, but if a movie doesn't have much else to offer, then what's the point? I found myself hurling this question around in my head until my skull broke while watching the new thriller I'm Your Woman."
Stewart's idea of inhabiting this part seems to be to scowl a lot and let her hair go unwashed. The Twilight star doesn't have the depth or emotional agility to go toe-to-toe with Gandolfini and Leo.
"This is a terrible, marketably violent film that sheds no light whatsoever on its ostensible subject matter or characters."
"The one-note wackiness of tone wars against the witty potshots, presumably intended, at incompetence on both sides of the law."
If only the Konami Code could fix this script.
"As one who is happy to champion Burton (he has many more hits than misses), it's disappointing not to see something more magical."
"Launches with enormous promise, then sinks into a quagmire of misfired humor and misbegotten characters."
"Best known as the movie that was filming at Pinewood when the James Bond stage burned down, this is probably one of the few films on director Ridley Scott's CV that he would prefer to forget."
"...while Estevez succeeds in catching some individually touching scenes, others are overwritten, phoney and irrelevant."
"Despite the story's elements of suspense, loss and determination, though, the picture has a mundane, low-stakes vibe that fails to make the most of its inspirational content."
"All it is, really, is astonishingly boring, terribly stupid, and, it bears repeating, boring. It's boring. (Also stupid.)"
"Jackie's vast neediness and ego overwhelm not only Coffee Black, but also the rest of Semi-Pro."
"This two-hander doesn't feature much more than its leads speechifying to their cameras, a challenging basis for visual storytelling."
"If the amount of surfing/suffering/staring-at-dark-skies footage rendered in slow motion were depicted at normal speed, ""The Shallows"" would run about a minute and a half."
A crafty setup without a compelling story is like a beautiful kitchen without any food. You leave both hungry.
Far from the aesthetic pretensions that are taken to the paroxysm&#44; its love letter to journalism seems to me as flat and wrinkled as a piece of newsprint thrown into the garbage can&#46; &#91;Full review in Spanish&#93;
Whatever novelty this series ever possessed has gone down the proverbial tube.
More interesting than you might imagine. But not interesting enough.
"When disappointments rack up, there comes a point where fans have to question whether the ""comic genius"" is really worthy of the label-and for Sacha Baron Cohen, The Brothers Grimsby will be that moment to take stock."
"The ending makes no sense. It is, I'm sorry to say, an outrageously dull watch, a monumental disappointment, and a flimsy finale to the Skywalker Saga."
A shockingly mundane disappointment taken on its own and a deeply misguided refraction of the original.
"Scarlet Diva has a voyeuristic tug, but all in all it's a lot less sensational than it wants to be."
Nothing in this movie means anything.
"Pacino ain't Satan this time around, he's just Pacino doing his Al Pacino imitation..."
"The movie takes a giant step back from plausibility, and I'm afraid some viewers will be unwilling to go along."
"Over-heated, overwrought, over-furnished and over-dressed."
So feel-sniffly-good it could make you revisit lunch.
"There's an interesting, funny, quietly devastating film to be made from the core idea here -- that of an average guy so convinced of his unworthiness that he subconsciously sabotages a golden romantic opportunity -- but this overly broad exercise in set-p"
those seeking a more meaningful romantic comedy should probably just rent 'My Best Friend's Wedding' instead.
"Stage Fright almost works as a pitch-perfect parody of '80s b-grade slashers, but succumbs to many of the genre's same weaknesses."
"Bogged down by ridiculous plotting involving warlocks, druids and Thorn that have no place in a movie about a villain who is supposed to be 'purely and simply evil.'"
"It is, perhaps, a bit telling and awkward that the best parts of What Now? are less about Kevin Hart being funny and more about people reacting to Kevin Hart."
A picture that has rented every fiber of its being.
"Audiences are likely to be as repelled by this lame & lamer combo as their would-be dance partners, because underneath their shallow and clueless veneers is just more shallowness and cluelessness."
A few decent running gags ... and an ocean of bad ones.
"A bland distraction for the school holidays and nothing more, the now-ubiquitous 3D version isn't any better."
A pathetic excuse for a comedy [that's] actually ... a feature-length effort to reposition Playboy's brand of squeaky-clean titillation as relevant to young men weaned on internet porn.
So this is Guy Ritchie's big comeback? Huh.
A failed attempt to match the tension and emotional dynamics of Fatal Attraction.
"Though Daldry elicits brilliant performances, particularly from Meryl Streep and Claire Danes, on balance The Hours is more pretentious than penetrating about existential despair."
"""Frances Ha""? More like Frances Bah!"
"It's a film that asks the right questions, but the answers aren't really dramatically persuasive."
"If I hadn't known it was Bryson, A Walk In The Woods would just feel like some half-assed oldsploitation version of Wild starring a poor man's odd couple with the comedic timing of a Google Translated Mexican sitcom from the eighties."
I'm glad to see Eva Green was able to secure her usual contractual codicils for raccoon eye makeup and at least 30 seconds of bared breasts.
"Fans of Keillor's radio show may love it, but it's just not engaging enough to satisfy the rest of us."
Never rises above the mediocrity and predictability it so frustratingly presents to us.
"Dillard's feature debut squanders its high concept ... and serves up a low-rent, Nickelodeon-lite version of that story, blowing his chance with corny acting, paint-by-numbers plotting, and a dippy score."
"Hollow, amateurish provocation with phony characters and an off-putting plot."
It will definitely divide audiences. Some may find it a graceful and understated master class in observation. Others may be put to sleep.
"A pointless homage to the cheesy buddy-cop action comedies of the 1980s, employing all the familiar tropes but failing to do anything with them."
"In comparison to its superior predecessors, Detour's redemption plot feels banal and slight."
"It calls itself a 'thriller,' apparently because it is loaded with pointless machinations that pile up into a tortured wreck of narrative desperation."
"An efficient, stark story about bad people getting what's coming to them. Or perhaps words like ""efficient"" and ""stark"" are just cozy ways of saying ""straightforward"" and ""simplistic."""
"For a studio whose storytelling style and command of visuals is so wonderfully inventive, here they've opted for the laziest, most obvious narrative trajectory imaginable, without even a winning sense of humour to back that up."
"The actors, except for Rex, are mostly nonprofessionals who work gamely to infuse the caricatural script... with heart and the director's incurious camera eye with life, but their presence can't overcome the movie's vain attitudinizing."
"It may want to be, as the British might say, a bloody riot, but in fact it seems to suffer from a case of comedic anemia."
There's no disguising fluff this fluffy.
"It strings together a series of funny skits, some of them dragged out way too long, allows us to pussy-foot along the edge of the serious issues but never really takes the plunge."
"It's interesting to see that even when everything that is censored out of a reality show is really shown, it's sometimes just as boring as it is on TV."
What it lacks is a cohesive structure and perspicuous storytelling.
"... horribly stale cookie cutter rom-com that is full of fake emotions, dead spots where the laughs belong, and a thoroughly unconvincing storyline."
"No need to tread lightly. The third installment to the Chronicles of Narnia definitely fairs better than the last one, Prince Caspian, but it still can't hold a candle to the first Narnia movie"
"While this sort of wan rebellion yarn seems to have been designed with a general audience in mind, there's nothing here that's so culturally specific or emotionally focused as to earn our emotional investment."
Avis layers every sequence with pop singles and confuses poor camera focus and colored lighting for aesthetic flair.
"It's not a costume drama in any real sense, with blusters of wind standing in for dialogue and, frankly, sheer boredom subbing for Brontë's look into the riddles of the human heart."
"A condescending picture that always takes aim at easy targets, fires away with a blunderbuss, and then pretends to be courageous for what it's done."
"Man of Steel offers nothing but torturous exposition, heavy-handed symbolism, criminally ill-used actors and a numbing finale that would be right at home in a Transformers sequel. It's one massive superbore."
Something's missing from the center of this self-consciously hip film noir: a hero you can feel for.
"Falls frustratingly short of its potential, thanks to the Coens' inability to construct a fluid narrative or respect characters enough to make them more than live-action cartoons."
"There is no one more deserving than Charlize Theron to be crowned Hollywood's next action hero. The story needs work, though."
It's Jane Austen for the young and the jobless or Woody Allen without the comic artistry or insight.
"When Sahara stops being about Dirk and Al's misadventures and starts being about viruses and mass murder, it loses its way."
"Kawase owns all the elements to build a worthy film, however Radiance (Hikari) doesn't work. [Full review in Spanish]"
Friendship comedy veers into serious territory.
"It's ruff to sit and stay through A Dog's Way Home, and anyone who can do so without walking out deserves a treat."
"The political thrust of the premise is defanged, and the movie becomes a toothless vehicle for Brooks's drowsy-eyed shtick."
It's a real riot when a guy goes tumbling and thudding down a 300-step flight of stone stairs only to climb back up and do it again. What inspired comedy!
"It has that homemade, backyard look we encounter so frequently in low-budget films. This is particularly damaging to a work that tries to compete with such superproductions as 2001 and A Clockwork Orange."
...a mess that might be the camp classic of 2007.
"A feeble string of raucous slapstick sequences, embarrassing scatological gags and cheap sexual jokes [that's] likely to leave you depressed rather than cheered."
"Disappointing horror adaptation that has one or two good points but is ultimately let down by a lacklustre script, unimaginative direction and a shockingly bland performance by Ben Barnes."
"It's not good, not even acceptable, but it's neither that terrible as I was expecting. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Like much of the Cult of Tarantino that eager audiences worship, ""Once Upon a Time"" might be meaningful and/or shocking if it weren't so barbaric, predictable, and vapid."
The film's very legitimate concerns were more expertly explored in a 2014 series by Brandon Loomis for the Arizona Republic.
A curiously flat and unthrilling thriller.
"Dude, I am bummed."
"Kidman and Bullock seem to be having fun with this, especially in the scenes where the practice of witchcraft, not an everyday thing to either of them, becomes desperate and, you know, icky."
Bizarrely inept.
"It wants to be a Southern Gothic for the new millennium, but plays more like a refried retread."
"Rather than a sing-along, consider this film a 'say-along,' with lines so clichd that you might find yourself reciting them in perfect sync with the flat characters."
"Pretentious when it should be penetrating, spasmodic when it means to be lyrical."
"Around halfway through, I was itching to see how much time remained."
"[Jon M.] Chu is a stylish director, and it's fun to watch him blow things up. He also paces the material furiously. For awhile, this strategy works. But, as with most movies that don't have any substance, the pomposity and spectacle grow tiresome."
The tedium ends up surpassing the fear. [Full review in Spanish]
"Jia's message is that globalization has failed to help the Chinese masses. We hear you, dude, but did you really need 143 minutes to get your point across?"
"Unimaginative fare, generic and humorless hero, banal villain."
The film runs a bit too long to hold the interest of most kids ... and it isn't witty enough to entertain adults who made it past the fourth grade.
That the movie is able to suspend disbelief for as long as it does is a testament to David Duchovny's likability as an actor.
"In Emmerich's universe, no one ever went broke underestimating the world's desire to see things go boom."
"Feels like one of those Underworld sequels, but with a samurai-wielding Japanese schoolgirl instead of the tight leather outfits . . ."
The title is wrong. They should call it Spinning Into Margarine.
Another mediocre one where things either don't make sense or are too predictable and familiar.
"... alas, the film seems more interested in set-up then any sort of thoughtful, or even logical, conclusion."
"A slapdash, clumsy, poorly acted and pervasively false film filled with precocious movie kids, nonstop needle drops and a barrage of ""washing your balls"" jokes."
"This unfunny, unoriginal, charmless teen comedy is so stunningly awful from start to finish, it's amazing to think its director has made a single film before, much less a dozen."
The film's limp and bedraggled. No one looks good in it. You wonder if Mamet would even recognise what he once wrote.
...overall lack of substance ultimately lends the proceedings a vibe of irrelevance.
"If The Blair Witch Project had the power to trouble your sleep, the rote replications of Blair Witch may just induce it."
"Even if you allow for the the fact that the film is geared towards the 5-year-old set, it's still a pretty dreary experience, made even more so by screamingly vivid colors, uninspiring animation and grating songs."
The Baxter is more than a little out of step in a summer peppered with crude or idiosyncratic wallflower romantics.
"As party porn goes, ""Project X"" has its moments. In terms of drama, character or intelligence, it's pure bong water."
"The result, though polished and professional, ultimately relies on too many stock situations to evoke the desired emotional impact..."
"Apart from hewing to old-school slasher rules as if they were the Talmud, the braintrusts behind My Bloody Valentine 3-D seem to have concentrated on coming up with things to shake at the audience, from the bloody to the benign, a la SCTV's Dr. Tongue."
"Imagine ""Kick Ass"" complicated by the far darker power fantasies of ""Observe and Report,"" and you have some idea where Gunn goes with this material."
"Lavishly produced by Zanuck, this big-budget historical epic is preposterously plotted and acted, though Shamroy's color cinematography is good."
It is at its best when Luhrmann&apos;s cinematic eccentricities are let loose and he leans into the raucous performances&#46; Regrettably&#44; the experience overall becomes far less than the sum of its parts&#46; 
"The extensive mayhem by tsunami that Shadyac unleashes is portrayed as comic and casualty-free, but of course adults can't help but be disturbed by imagery of a catastrophe that would have cost many thousands of lives being dismissed so casually."
"Overall, Overboard is a shameful remake. It seems to be made for television and exploitative (in a bad way) of the talents of Eugenio Derbez. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"There is not a single moment in Sunu Gonera's Pride that you haven't already seen, or that you can't predict."
"There's only so many car chases and so much watching of Matt Damon walking purposefully in and out of buildings, baseball cap pulled low over his eyes, that a man can take."
The story had promise but it ends up being half baked by a director who wants to show off that he went to film school.
Stuber is a violent&#44; predictable&#44; underwhelming&#44; and even plodding two-star ride&#46;
The chief sin committed by Gulliver's Travels is not that it's a poor adaptation but that its entertainment value is almost nonexistent.
This despicable doc leers far more than it reveals.
"Like a Norman Rockwell painting of a public execution, Let Him Go is awfully quaint about the casual violence it accepts as everyday. As the film gets progressively more grim, it almost pathologically leans in toward chicken soup sentimentality...."
"Too silly to be scary, and a bit too dull to be a midnight-movie guilty pleasure."
"While it is clear right from the outset that Caine's participation in... Four Kids and It is little more than an easy paycheck gig for him, he proves to be the only real point of interest in this otherwise bland and lackluster story."
"In the end, though, in spite of its hard-hearted cynical veneer, David Gordon Green's comedy-drama turns into a strangely soft-centred and manipulative affair."
...directed with bland efficiency...
"If you like watching people drive really nice cars really fast, ""Need for Speed"" scratches that particular itch. But expect nothing more, because everything else about it is just running on empty."
Political humor is a mainstay in this country's conversation about issues that affect us all. But the minute you get preachy is the minute your little satire souffl falls.
If only it wasn't such bloody nonsense.
"A serviceable but not stylish filmmaker, Adler shoots office spaces and restaurants in a blandly shadowy style redolent of peak TV."
"Miracle is a suitably rigorous sports movie. On the other hand, at no time does it break out of the sports movie mold."
A well-acted film with some elements that work&#44; but that in general&#44; doesn&apos;t quite come together&#59; and that by trying to do a lot&#44; it loses all the charm that was so present in its two predecessors&#46; Full review in Spanish&#46;
Only sporadically feels like an effort interested in grappling with the miserable fallout from tragedy.
There are plot holes big enough for Shamu the killer whale to swim through.
Deserves to be sent straight to the moon.
The Replacements deserves replacement as quickly as possible.
"Zellweger and Clooney do have screwball chemistry, but the screenplay, by sportswriters Duncan Brantley and Rick Reilly, is rife with scenes done better in the classic romantic comedies it admires."
"What this latest entry makes clear is that even in the hands of the man who first brought it to the screen, there's nothing left for the Alien franchise to say."
"It's hard to know what's worse here; the jaw-dropping misogyny on show or the lazy, ridiculously convenient world building that is there purely to service the plot."
"Who knows what might have happened if he had the time and the leverage to smooth out the rough edges, but material this junky can only be salvaged for so much scrap."
... the film astoundingly reaches new levels of unintentional self-parody with every turn.
"Somehow simultaneously too much and not enough. At 143 minutes, it well overstays its welcome as a movie, but with a little more fleshing out it might have worked as a miniseries."
"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, Star Wars was fun. I miss that time."
"The movie has some bright spots, but so much of it revolves around the resident diva of the title camp that it's hard to focus on the good stuff; you're too annoyed at having this lazily imagined character shoved down your throat for the zillionth time."
"One must give in to the fantastical elements in films of this kind, but some of the plot details in this mashup production (Toy Story + Monsters Inc. + a generic stage show) are as visibly defective as its heroes but much less huggable."
"This uncalled-for sequel to the mediocre 2001 talking-pets affair Cats & Dogs is all needless noise and second-rate CGI gunk, and never, ever funny in any sense of the word."
"The charisma of its cast should be included amid its bloody body count. It's hard to know what anyone saw in this particular dirty-cop tale co-written by James Ellroy. It's not ""The Black Dahlia."" It's ""The Black Duh-lia."
"The tone is less incisive, it seems as if... the opportunity to carry out a media criticism about the way in which the press hovers around the lives of big stars is lost. [Full review in Spanish]"
It just feels like a generic superhero movie with Scooby-Doo characters in it. It's just really forgettable.
"The Kitchen provides, if nothing else, a lesson in dismemberment."
Penguin lovers will be ecstatic.
Feels disingenuous and dogmatic.
"Those scenarios are all rooted in a particular brand of Hollywood desperation, though Carolla's stilted screen presence and groan-worthy zingers neuter any humor from Bruce's needy quest to return to the spotlight."
I just want to know what the hell happened to What Planet Are You From?
"With more attention to detail, this could have worked, but the time travel aspects are so badly executed that the movie as a whole falters and eventually rips apart at the seams."
"It is nice to know that even after the apocalypse, people will still be listening to Al Green."
"Its humor is successful and unsuccessful by turns, and although Comedian Carl Reiner is the director, the instinct here is to give most of both credit and blame to Martin."
"Unofficial remake of Devil's Advocate, with Pacino in a role he can do in his sleep, part Svengali part Pygmalion, seducing an innocent with the allure of consumer capitalism"
"At the risk of being brutal, I would say that the Witherspoon of Legally Blonde, a far more bubbleheaded picture, was not merely sharper but Sharper than her Becky."
A bit of an uneventful slog.
"Despite the appealing supporting performers, I'd like to cap this movie."
"Doesn't throw in the kind of wit that can turn a formulaic creature feature into a pleasant diversion along the lines of ""Lake Placid."""
"The Skeleton Key is more creaky than creepy, like visiting an expensive haunted house."
"There's little sense of momentum or urgency, and everything reaches back rather than looking forward."
"For an example of how not to blend genres, look to Krampus, which fuses horror, comedy and the Christmas feelgood movie into one lumpy festive package."
Mostly disappointingly and surprisingly flat.
An almost excessively familiar romantic comedy...
"Shot in sepia tints, with detailed period sets and ornate facial hair, the tableaux vivants that constitute Steven Spielberg's wry hagiography resemble Mathew Brady daguerreotypes, and are about as lively."
...an early candidate for worst movie of the year...
[O]nly indiscriminate vampire-swooning tweens will appreciate [Pattinson's] portrayal of the surrealistic Spanish painter and filmmaker Salvador Dal&iacute;.
"Day's performance is equally magnetic offstage, conveying the singer's affection toward her closest confidants... and the lifetime of torment that repeatedly drove her back into the throes of addiction. It's truly great work that belongs in a better film."
"Deadly traps may remain the bread and butter of the Saw series, but the real trick has become keeping these fetid sequels moderately fresh."
This first feature by Ray Griggs wears its Mad Magazine influences like a badge of honor but fails to round up enough laughs to save the day.
"""Meek's Cutoff"" is earnest and sober to the point of suffocation, which often happens when the decision is made to shut off the air of entertainment."
Feels like nothing more than a pleasant but distant business transaction.
"Enthralled by his own genius and desire to make another blockbuster, Shyamalan has taken a terrific B-movie idea and inflated it into what he wants us to believe is a serious commentary on faith."
"The film's chief interest isn't plumbing philosophical questions of fate, providence and autonomy but, instead, wallowing in skimpy fairy-tale romanticism."
"Much like sequels do, Muppets Most Wanted feels like a downgraded watch compared to Bobin's original, but enough puppet-fueled comedy guides us safely from start to finish."
"Director (Ramon) Salazar is no Pedro Almodvar, try as he might."
[W]here's the Wonder Woman -- engaging and empowered and empowering -- whom we came to admire in that first film?
"This is the middle one of a middling trio of entries in the franchise, with regular star Vin Diesel replaced by a particularly burly and surly Ice Cube. End result: no-one wins."
"Don't Look Up is both types of blunt: It makes no bones about exactly what the filmmakers think of climate-change deniers and social-media distractions, and it repeatedly blunts the impact of its satire by calling its shots early, often, and loudly."
"Amusing in small doses, marketed to kids and not really FOR kids. An undeserving Oscar winner."
"A Kid Like Jake is a necessary movie in theory, but that doesn't mean it works or feels entirely authentic."
Hill&apos;s movie is at least consistent in offering up disappointment&#46;
Exodus feels like a missed opportunity.
The ugly smell of unexamined privilege hangs over this film like the smoke from cheap incense.
"Despite all Giedroyc's cinematic flamboyance and Feldstein's undoubted commitment, the picture is let down by its unsympathetic central character."
"Spielberg's intent may be satirical, but I find these stereotypes even more depressing than hobgoblins, and would not have minded if they'd all been dragged off into the fourth dimension."
"There is nothing to sympathize with but the sets, which get far too many drinks spilled on them. "
"Not enough Eddie, and not the Eddie we want. Murphy is just too generous in both these movies: he gives so much screen time away to his co-stars, he himself barely registers, yet he's the reason we're here."
"At best, it's a sweetly recorded live album, sprinkled with sycophants and some choice soundbites from Noel Gallagher repeatedly declaring Oasis one of the greatest rock bands of all time."
Either it goes for a particular tone and doesn't achieve it. Or it does achieve a tone that's not really worth striving for.
"Often very beautiful looking, but gracelessly directed."
[An] uncomfortable combination of giggle-inducing absurdity and disgustingly graphic visions of death.
Dirty Dancing is dull and charmless. The initial curiosity turns into disappointment and the only memorable aspect is the effort of the protagonist Jennifer Grey. [Full Review in Spanish]
"It requires a stretch of the imagination too far, but there's still plenty of gore and tricksy murders here."
"The humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch, elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny."
The only positive thing I can say about Land of the Lost is that it's so bad perhaps it will put an end to the classic-TV-to-film machine.
"Several of the characters in Dune are psychic, which puts them in the unique position of being able to understand what goes on in the movie."
"No one can doubt the filmmakers' motives, but The Guys still feels counterproductive."
"Stone and Thompson's performances and the costume designs offer tasty ingredients, but it felt more like a calculated effort to establish a franchise few wanted."
Chooch is really just an outline for a movie.
"When the smoke finally clears for the final credits, we may have had a tolerably good time, but there's no lingering satisfaction."
Virtually every dramatic beat and character quirk is underlined so that no one can possibly miss it and it similarly goes out of its way to ensure that the film remains resoundingly apolitical so as not to upset anyone in the slightest.
"A strange hodgepodge of genres and tones, right down to a particularly off-putting mid-section montage that serves as a classic move-the-story-along device."
"For those who like a plot along with their car races and lava surfing, it's game over, quickly."
"On the positive side there is Gal Gadot. On the negative side there is the script, the setting, Kristen Wiig, Pedro Pascal, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera."
"It's all about the extensive climax, a gunfight turned mixed martial arts throwdown."
"This return to the financial world's most famous address is a bit like talking to a bad financial adviser - mostly boring, overly complicated, and in the end you feel a little ripped off."
"It's easy to lose patience with Eric's particular problems, the result of a lack of self-awareness."
"In fairness, the movie is more or less competent for being what it is. Of course, I could say the same of most brick walls -- but I'd hardly recommend that you pay eight bucks to sit in front of one for two hours."
"The Lucky One is so dismal, so off-kilter, so nonsensical that even the ever-ready charms of Zac Efron cannot redeem it in the slightest."
"The basic premise is actually fairly interesting. Unfortunately, it's been poorly worked out and clumsily executed."
An absolutely interminable horror comedy...
"An uneven, ultimately unsatisfying attempt to transfer the groundbreaking and boomer-beloved 60s TV exploits of Rocket J. Squirrel and Bullwinkle Moose to the big screen."
"""After"" catalogs so many clichs in the dysfunctional family at its center that the film could be taught in a screenwriting class as a lesson in what not to do."
"You can smell how desperate the guys are to make us laugh again, and it's just not a funny odor."
"Full of good intentions and lessons, perhaps this was the reason to its great success as a book, but as a movie it fails entirely. [full review in Spanish]"
"The film tiptoes around the issue as much as something like ""Knocked Up"" did - it just tiptoes around the other side."
"The story just doesn't have much shape to it, and crucial information about Cole and Alejandra seems to be missing."
"Excessive exposition, subplots, and secondary characters distract from the title story about the barbaric 1947 murder of Elizabeth Short, a striving 22-year-old actress at odds with the treacherous streets of Los Angeles."
"Producer Michael Karz ascertains that ""When you see a Garry Marshall movie, you know you're going to leave happy"". Make that suicidal."
"The zoot suits and fedoras look great, but without a script or hard-eyed private detective in sight, it's merely a production designer's exercise."
"The movie was needlessly converted to 3-D. The images are not blurry and distracting as some 3-D conversions have been, but neither are they terribly impressive, adding nothing but a few extra dollars to the price of a ticket."
A surprisingly joyless mash-up of every bit of fanboy flotsam floating around in its maker's cranium.
"An '80s-style B-movie, and it wants to look and feel like one."
"Lego Ninjago, conversely, can't sustain its central joke over an overlong 101 minutes. Everything is not quite awesome."
"Within twenty minutes, Bon Voyage has dipped a toe in the waters of five or six distinct genres--never to cohere, alas"
"With Vaughn virtually asleep on the job throughout, his two very uncomfortable-looking castmates are hardly going to step in and save the day."
At last -- a film that will appeal to both the tween market and the raincoat crowd! (Some folks say art can't bring people together?)
"The film looks terrific, though the bravely bananas twist doesn't work. Michelle Yeoh is fantastic - Santa the Christmas shop boss is the tart lemon in a festive citrus fruit bowl."
The massive stage at Radio City Music Hall doesn't lend itself easily to the intimate particulars of the blues.
"At one point, the chef and CNN host Anthony Bourdain calls the Carlyle ""completely nuts."" I believe him - and would love to see the movie that actually makes the case."
"Stewart moves through the picture looking noble and sadly dull, unwittingly setting the stage for the evil queen to steal her show."
Paisley and McGuinness's intellectual back and forth is rendered so compellingly that one wishes the filmmakers didn't feel a need to resort to a surfeit of momentum-killing plot contrivances.
"Fitfully entertaining and sometimes brilliantly silly &#8212; just not really engaging, and occasionally objectionable."
"This man without qualities is a concept rather than a man, an ambitious rich actor's condescending fantasy of a colorless suburban schmo."
Wheezy and cheap
The production's refusal to try anything edgy condemns Rock Star to the rock pile of cinematic mediocrity.
"The subject could have provided a great vantage point for a critical satire, but Boundaries lacks the laughs and the sting for that."
"Here it is, the first (to the best of my knowledge) spin-off of the sequel of a movie that was a remake in the first place."
"Much like the 1971 Marshall team, this picture is long on heart and short on talent."
This is too clever by half.
The script is a jumble of caricatures and cliches.
"Mourning takes all shapes, grief has no timeline, and pain is as personal, but ""Land"" grapples so uneasily with such heady topics that the result is the total absence of new insights."
"[It] is impossible to gauge what type of audience, other than the die-hard Chan completists, will feel wholly satisfied by this schizophrenic genre hodgepodge."
"The film isn't even sexy. The sex scenes are just strange and awkward; and the relationship, like I said, is so toxic that you can't really get any enjoyment out of those scenes either. It's just a giant disappointing mess."
"Brady Corbet's film promises great things, and there are kernels of ambitious, fascinating ideas throughout, but they don't pay off."
"In Our Kind of Traitor, the characters are shallow and tension nonexistent."
"Bandits is inescapably lite, lite, lite, unfolding on the level of a factory product, not a human experience."
"McAdams and Bana are easy enough on the eyes to distract from the script's Grand Canyon-sized plot holes, but not enough to keep your mind off the insipid storytelling. Even from its gooey sentimental standpoint, ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" is two pints sh"
"As narrator-star Eugene Hutz puts it, ""Without filth, there can be no wisdom."" As deep thoughts go, this seems too feeble to provoke much in the way of actual thought, let alone to hang a movie on."
It takes a rugged survivalist mentality to sit through 108 minutes of Off the Map.
It has a good heart. I'll give it that. Maybe what it needs is more exotic marigolds.
"A movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist's waiting room, complete with soothing Muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms."
The thing that shocked me most was how the movie felt like some cheap-o straight-to-DVD thriller. The production values - from cinematography to editing to musical score - are little more than adequate.
A little too lacking in sophistication to really stand out.
Maybe [Hu and The Rock's] next film showcase will amount to something more than a throwaway episode of Hercules: The Legendary Journeys.
"The film can't even rely on Nicolas Cage to raise its heartbeat, finding the actor looking tired and disinterested. Frankly, with this script, I don't blame him."
"Most of the time it plays like the movie adaptation of a Land's End catalogue, making monogamy seem essential by associating it with high-end interior design."
"The producers had the right idea hiring former Buffy the Vampire Slayer scribe Marti Noxon to write the screenplay. Unfortunately, they also hired director Craig Gillespie, who once again shows why he shouldn't be allowed around film equipment."
"Throughout Rothe gives it a right go, despite being stuck in a movie that is never certain of what it's trying to be, or when it's going to end."
"It plays like a bad episode of the old '60s television series, The Time Tunnel, with lots of uninvolving, back-and-forth action and little to thrill us with the exciting incongruities of time travel."
"As a whole, ""The First Purge"" is not without merit&#151;even when it's less than eloquent in its delivery, at least it has something on its mind&#151;but this is the first installment where signs of series fatigue are in evidence."
"""Hail, Caesar!"" Hail? No. Maybe a faint nod of mild approval, but that's all."
"Disappointing, poorly conceived comedy that's both emotionally unconvincing and depressingly low on laughs, though the performances ensure that it remains watchable."
The Back-Up Plan is either someone's idea of a joke or simply what passes for mainstream romantic comedy these days. I'm afraid it's the latter.
"Unless you thrill to evildoers getting their comeuppance with a splash of red and no shades of grey, you'd be wise to cleanse yourself of the series."
"The insurmountable problem is the two-and-a-half-hour (argh!) running time, during which the minuscule central conflict is bulked out by tedious 'put the lost key thing into the other gizmo thing' cross-plots."
"Effects dominate story: The real carnage, however, is inflicted on the screenplay."
trippy
"It might not be a complex or deep movie, but it's good enough to make you laugh occasionally. [Full review in Spanish]"
A film with Ted's ingredients should have you stone-drunk on laughter but this film is the comedic equivalent of pissed-in light beer: its 2.5% funny.
The Beautiful Country provides a panorama without insight.
"It's somewhat better put together than Saw II or III, though there isn't a scare in it."
The earlier Alvin movie made more than $217 million just in the United States. It's hard to imagine this somewhat confused sequel doing as well.
"On the positive side, many of the explosions and stunts are technical marvels. If the scenes had been more tightly and coherently written, at least action fans would have something to crow about. As it stands, ""Act of Valor,"" is a failed mission."
Despite fleeting moments of cleverness and poignancy&#44; the script is too haphazard and chaotic to ground the viewer into the narrative&#46;
"A derivative, formulaic piece of pseudo-inspirational melodrama."
Self-consciously written and directed redemption saga that's certainy not as compelling as other dramas in this British gangland genre.
"The whole is so overfamiliar that ""Shoplifting"" never gets over being a drag."
Wendell &amp; Wild is narratively overstuffed past its limits&#44; losing its protagonist and the impact of her journey in the chaos&#46;
This feeble spoof of self-help spiritualism is atrocious and inanely tedious.
"Plagued by a plot full of ridiculous contrivances, uneven performances, and a third-act twist that's not very shocking. (Splice Today)"
"It is true that this situation is suspensive, but it does not put the picture over, because the thought of blowing up a human being to pieces is not entertaining."
He commits the very last sin his characters would permit -- he loses control with multiply paranoid layers that wear out instead of boring in.
"It has a few funny bits here and there, but they're deeply mired in the seen-it-all-beforeness of the film."
The pleasure and the pain are all up there on the screen; we just wish it was less painful to watch.
Doesn't have much to add beyond a few biographical details.
"The plot of Labor Day would make a great Upworthy article. Let me suggest a title: ""I Never Thought I'd Want My Mom to Love a Murderer Until I Met This Bloody Hunk."""
The pleasure of such company isn't enough to compensate for watching a succession of scenes that are like recruitment ads for abattoir work.
"Stearns' third feature is his least satisfying so far; as visually drab as its predecessors, it has more difficulty mining its off-kilter aesthetic for nervous laughter and conceptual provocation."
Yawn.
This is a movie whose mouth you want to wash out with soap.
"As a cautionary tale about the perils of nation building, this is both creepy and provocative, but director Rodrigo Cortés blows it in the last few minutes with a rushed ending that feels like a cheat after all the escalating tension."
The violence is astounding but the film looks cheap and the script is derivative.
"Winds up seeming heavy-handed, like an elephant trying to dance ballet--a movie about magic that's just not magical enough."
"Rockwell is great as always, but the film must resolve itself and it's watchability suffers."
Tron is loaded with visual delights but falls way short of the mark in story and viewer involvement.
"Johnstone, a friend of the family, maintains too discreet a distance from her subject."
I feel no pity for Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau who co-wrote the piece. For their co-stars...we hope this career-killer is worth the paycheck.
From frame one&#44; it is clear where this is going&#44; and instead of trying to challenge or charm&#44; Your Place or Mine settles for a forgettable romance&#44; no matter where you watch it&#46;
[Elizabeth Olsen's] impressive portrayal - and even an admittedly interesting overall conclusion - just isn't enough to rescue a film that is literally agonising to watch.
"This time, Jesus rather than Burt Reynolds or The Rock gets the credit for leading an underdog team of football players to victory."
Huston has crowded such an attractive world around the subject of this biography -- such surging impressions of Parisian activities -- that you never get a good line on the artist himself.
"one bad, long-winded lawyer joke"
It would take divine intervention to breathe freshness into Blues Brothers 2000.
A frail independent feature with an impressive cast but not much energy and equally little point.
"Though handsomely mounted, this parable of intersecting destinies and implacable tragedy is as lifeless as a wax tableau."
"Enough, already. It's time for an intervention. Steve Martin, you're no longer allowed to work with director Shawn Levy."
This one starts going for the throat &#46;&#46;&#46; By the end&#44; though&#44; it offers only a soft slap on the cheek&#46;
"The Twilight Saga is an obvious target for parody, but this crude and unfunny movie makes a hash of it."
"As conveyances go, this is no vehicle -- it's a train. Unfortunately, the train keeps hopping the tracks."
"Victor Frankenstein is certainly entertaining and even ambitious, but it's uneven plotting and execution, plus the fact that, at the end of the day, it doesn't really offer anything new - only some rather over-the-top action sequences."
"The type of film with which Mr. Ratner has claimed to be infatuated is itself like a caper -- it requires precise execution. ""Tower Heist"" is more like that 10-story Snoopy, as he drunkenly bobs along Central Park West."
A ghastly misfire that brings out the self-indulgent worst in everyone involved.
"By the midway point, there are reminders that this is the work of a first-time director making a small-scale epic."
"It's a great idea, however the execution's not very impressive."
It's bafflingly creaky and oddly lacking in any sort of personality beyond its rather played-out critiques of the fairy tales we all know are bad.
"A bleak, depressing attempt to remove all glorification or justification from the serial killer subgenre."
"Aren't we yet done with all this cheap 'n' cheesy hand-held, wobbly-all-over-the-place, found footage so-manic-you-can't-tell-what's-going-on POV movie stuff?"
...the kind of movie that gives sincerity a bad name.
"Zodiac certainly has its moments, but it's no masterpiece."
"Doesn't suffer because it's mostly a bad film, it suffers because it's a bad film without direction or a point..."
Watching McCarthy's story unfold is a lot like listening to a brooding musician hold down the lowest key on a piano for two unrelenting hours.
"A sweet central premise and a charismatic cast curdle into repetitious overkill and ""gay panic"" gags."
"This ""Shadow of a Doubt"" riff is a bisexual Hitchcock teaser."
"Al Pacino and Robert De Niro collect bloated paychecks with intent to bore in Righteous Kill, a slow-moving, ridiculous police thriller that would have been shipped straight to the remainder bin at Blockbuster if it starred anyone else."
"A few song and dance numbers would have livened things up and could have turned this dull excursion into a fun sing-along like ""Labyrinth"" (1986). No such luck."
"At the end of the day, the cast and crew of Baywatch all came together to make something absolutely disposable and utterly forgettable."
The members of Metallica have become so successful and so insulated from the real world that they actually think that everyone else should care about their problems as much as they do.
"All I can tell you about Clint Eastwood in Joe Kidd is that he plays a ruthless gunman of few words. This isn't exactly a surprise... The funny thing about Joe Kidd, though, is that we can't keep straight whose side he's on, or why."
The Dark is Rising is one of those awful sorcery tales where a spotty young boy (Alexander Ludwig) suddenly gets to save the Earth from supernatural creeps such as Christopher Eccleston.
Another sanitized bio of a flawed man.
"Why Him? never answers its central question satisfactorily, nor does it justify the unfunny attempts to solve the conundrum"
"Honeydripper is an electrifying period piece about how music can bring folks together and generally save one's soul -- or at least its final 15 minutes is. The rest of the time, it's just a lot of sassy talk and scenery."
"New players, a new story line, a new director and nearly three decades of improved technology including all the whiz-bang-wow the latest 3-D has to offer. Unfortunately, there's not nearly enough new life."
Les Mis&#233;rables is as sodden as a tear-filled hankie. Director Hooper gets bogged down by the bulk of his movie.
[A] faux-'30s goof about an impish gigolo who woos and abuses a rich debutante.
"Instead of creating menace, the effort mostly underwhelms, dealing with hammy performances and static situations."
"Poolhall Junkies is a bad movie, but admirable in a way for its sheer effort."
"Whilst the mysterious premise and sensory illusions make for a relatively mesmeric experience, Villeneuve struggles to repress the same heavy-handedness that's been present throughout his oeuvre."
"A motion picture depicting the birth of the Savior ought to stir the soul, not just pass time during a frantic holiday season."
"Sandler, who really is close to comedy genius when he's being original, is just plain awful."
You're better off ignoring this junk and saving your time.
"Falls short in many ways, from its vaudevillian-esque sensibility to the look-at-me-Ma attitude pervading every frame."
[The jokes] are in short supply.
Its familiar story passes with nothing to distinguish itself from the many other similarly plotted movies and sitcoms.
"Here's one of those comedies like Meet the Parents where an awkward family situation escalates, and everyone onscreen behaves so farcically that their inane behavior can only be explained by the requirements of the script. "
"Schaeffer is the one who fells Lucy by casting himself in the male lead, then failing to convince anyone that either female lead could be attracted to his character."
I suppose I should be impressed that 17 Again turned out to be bad in a way I did not anticipate: it is awkward and creepy.
...makes the full-circle journey all the way from distant to cloying.
"The well-directed chase sequences mean it is intermittently exhilarating, while close attention to the aftermath of gun violence suggests hidden depths that nevertheless struggle to make much of an impact in a predictable, cliche-ridden screenplay."
"An intriguing story with engaging performances about a compelling real-life character, but oddly inert, and can't quite make all its many aspects gel into a wholly satisfying or wholly coherent story."
"The toons might be (almost) effortlessly entertaining, yet even they can't rescue what ends up feeling like a confused and pointless exercise in flexing studio muscles."
"One wonders, in fact, if 9 should have stuck with its original short format."
The nihilistic atmosphere eventually becomes so oppressive that it swallows everything in its path.
There's Something Pathetic About Mary
"Bravo has undeniable talent behind the camera, but her first effort can't live up to its source. Call me old-fashioned, but a movie should be more exciting than reading a bunch of tweets."
"Meirelles has crafted a lurid, even hysterically visual, but dramatically trite and obvious approximation of whatever was intended by Saramago."
"I loved the subversive nature frosting Ozon's other films, I found myself scratching my head after Under the Sand."
"Biutiful is mushy and self-important and the subplots Inarritu adds to it only dilute the film further, while also pushing it's running time to a watery two and a half hours."

"...boils down to the assertion that God is that voice in your head, a fairly innocent concept until God starts telling you to do something wrong."
"As creepy-doll flicks go, The Boy isn't the worst I've ever seen. That honour would probably go to 2007's Dead Silence."
"A small and fuzzy blip in an already very bad film year, as nondescript and uninvolving as its title."
Washington's performance is full of nervous tics and mood swings that don't amount to much - just like the movie overall.
"Cameron Crowe did not write or direct Moonlight Mile, but he may as well have, since the movie feels and looks and most of all sounds like his work. From my point of view, this is not a compliment..."
"Wooden performances make empathy impossible, and the scattershot narrative loses all the riches of the source material."
"...a bleak, formalist study of an undeniably compelling subject."
an odd and sloppy grab bag of bits and concepts likely to appeal only to hardcore fans while leaving others scratching their heads.
"First Blood examined a man grappling with PTSD that's forced into violence. Last Blood, unfortunately, examines a franchise grappling with a shocking lack of relevance."

"The dialogue is wiseass yet witless, the action incessant minus any novelty of style, stunts, or ideas."
"The Gentlemen is a facsimile, multiple times over. It has all the elements of a Guy Ritchie movie (star-studded cast, a token American, casual racism, sporadic bursts of violence), but it doesn't reach the heights of his best work."

Condon misuses his characters and tries to turn the film into a suspenseful high-stakes drama but falls very short in his execution.
"The world of Body of Lies should feel chaotic and dangerous. But Scott's camera, smoothly gliding across one stately image after another, keeps assuring us everything is fine."
"Aside from the occasional 'boo!' moment, the film lacks anything to stand nape hairs on end, and the trail -- which occupies a majority of the overlong 113 minute running length -- is unremarkable, despite some nice performances."
"Egoyan is known for dense and sometimes inscrutable narratives, but here his abstruse sprawl seems deliberately evasive."
Extremely predictable... there is something that happens that it just gives it everything away very easily.

It seems too many variables have led to a shallow antihero that doesn't hold up to Fox or Marvel Studio's offerings. Venom deserved better than that.

"Viggo Mortensen's directorial debut has good intentions, but sadly falls short of delivering on them."
"The climax, when it comes, is yet more of the fumbled plotting that has made the Fifty Shades films a trial to watch."
The movie plays too much with extremes. The opening is needlessly sleazy. This leads to an ending that plays out needlessly schmaltzy and corny.
"Guffaw you will, but like a middling sketch show, it gives your sides too many opportunities to recover."
"Romantic comedies can withstand a lot more heart and respect, and this tripe doesn't bother with either."
"Instead of crafting a meaningful family comedy with some low level of educational integrity, Shawn Levy and his cohorts merely string together a series of sensational, kiddie-pleasing visuals."
"Like its protagonist, the film is pretty to look at, but emotionally chilly; conceptually rich, but narratively unfulfilling."

"The film, directed by Spanish genre hack Jaume Collet-Serra, seems to have confused itself with a sedate character piece when the premise demands relentless brain-off fun."
"What starts out as a horrible, even tragic set-up ends up feeling more like a so-so episode of The Twilight Zone."
"Plays as if its creators spent too much time trying to guess what people wanted to see, and not enough on what kind of movie they'd like to make."

A film that has considerably less on its mind than it thinks.
Maybe it's about time Murphy fired his agent and tried reviving his career.
"End of the Spear is a childish and visually repetitive movie, ham-fisted, proselytizing and overtly simplified."
The title holds true for about 20 minutes or so in the middle of director Dean Parisot's loose remake of the 1977 Jane Fonda-George Segal vehicle ...
"Disappointingly, Barreto's film is sorely lacking in artfulness, even being so corny as to utilize voiceover recitations as a device to make the tired on-screen happenings seem more meaningful than they actually are."
"The issue at hand is not particularly cinematic...And the personal story is handled in a way that seems surprisingly impersonal, even superficial."
The film's sole dramatic preoccupations are with broad physical comedy and unrealistically offbeat characterizations; a few moments of nominal pathos are really just structural pauses in the joke series.
"The special effects are chintzy -- some of the time, it looks like the people are being attacked by Garfield."
"Jenny and Joe don't help to make a case for the ""good men"" and ""strong women"" they seem to oppose. They only drag everyone down."
Introducing the diePhone
"Rarely in a British comedy have so many richly talented actors laboured so long in search of a coherent plot, plausible characters and even a modicum of humour."
"If the barest elements of political psychology and social pathology are suggested in the course of the film, they're undercut and banalized by the movie's homogenized aesthetic..."
Ten minutes into the movie Gooding already has screamed at least 57 times.
Witnessing `Goldmember' is...akin to monitoring a patient for signs of exhaustion.
"Quickly the film shows itself to be the usual kind of thing about an old house with secret passages, sliding panels, disappearing figures, reaching hands, and the like."
"Wander Darkly is ultimately a mess, one not nearly as wise or profound as it believes itself to be, but Miller's work is so good that there are stretches -- though not nearly enough of them -- when it almost seems to work after all."
"the type of broad, fish out of water comedy where each crossed signal is telegraphed a mile away and the lead character falls down a lot"

It's a sequel to skip.
"I've gained more from Googling the real people and historical events depicted in Mr Jones than I have from the film itself. It works as a jumping-off point, to bring awareness to events that aren't as well-known as the atrocities of WWII."
a rather lumbering vehicle that runs primarily on formula and (pseudo)psychological ploys that we have seen too many times at this point to warrant much excitement.
"Despite boasting a remarkable performance from John Garfield, I find the narrative to be a bit mechanical and lacks punching force like boxing film noir. [Full review in Spanish]"
The film is wildly indiscriminate in its approach to storytelling.
"While it is mostly jaw-dropping, there are still a few good moments, to be relished and savoured like a stinky five-day-old fish rescued by James Corden from a bin."
"Lesson learned: time travel is difficult, but making it work on screen is even harder."
Prisoners of the Ghostland isn't campy enough to be camp.
Much-anticipated sequel to The Matrix is both phenomenally talky and loaded with action and effects. How can this be? It's long.

"Without a compelling drama, an ounce of humor, or even a character to sympathize with, Terminator Salvation may as well be the next Transformers."
"""Black Rock"" is as dingy and dirty as the genre thrillers it appears to want to one-up. All it does, though, is bring everyone down."
"With a more intelligent and taut screenplay, Valkyrie could have been much more riveting rather than merely be sporadically thrilling, mostly bland and, ultimately, underwhelming."
This is a film about deeply confused people that seems likely to put viewers in a state of deep confusion for most of its running time.
These actors all deserve better than being forced to spout dubious relationship advice from an egomaniac.
Not since Larry David's Sour Grapes has a movie kicked off by so thoroughly painting its protagonists as deeply unlikable souls.
"While there are certainly some merits to Dan Gilroy's first foray into horror, the humor often plays better than the horror elements, and they rarely feel like they're meshed-together particularly well."

One can't help but think there was a smarter film to be made from this premise.
"The proceedings mainly revolve around sexual and bathroom humour, and - depending on your tastes - this will either quickly grow tiresome, or will entertain you endlessly."
Questions of how people and circumstances change over time are brushed aside in favor of blatant tear-jerking.
The Missing is holiday entertainment for anyone who likes either a dollop of feminist uplift or family values (or both!) with their bloodletting.
"Smart and stylized - which doesn't innoculate this story of a sad billionaire against lethal familiarity and dullness. Pattinson's stiffness works, but the dialogue is vapid."
"The performances by Hoffman and Phoenix are compelling, but the storyline surrounding their father-son dynamic is not."
Schumacher is in his clenched&#44; &#8220;realistic&#8221; mode here&#44; and Carrey gives a grim&#44; exhausted performance that would better suit a more serious movie&#46;
The Accountant starts from nowhere and reaches nowhere as it keeps oscillating between a good idea and an average execution. The film seems longer than its 120-minute length.
"The Intern could have been a tight, funny, lickety-split 85-minute comedy, but Meyers stretches it for more than two hours, with punchy interchanges and a few solid laughs drowning under a tidal wave of terminal cuteness."
"It's not much, other than the vision thing."
Give credit to the filmmakers for making a faith-affirming picture that aims to be more thoughtful than maudlin. But what they've ended up with is a fairly rote Christian redemption narrative - albeit with more charts and graphs.
"Theroux doesn't maintain firm control of the tone, particularly going astray in attempts at comic interludes as well as in the ending."
No topic is too sacred for the ferocious Farrellys.
[Robert] Rodriguez pushes the envelope but fails to make any lasting impression except revulsion at the spectacle of acclaimed independent filmmakers wasting their talents on such trash.
"It all collapses inward, foundering on its own improbabilities."
"You don't have to be a schoolyard bully to find yourself longing to administer swift, vicious wedgies to the nerdish inhabitants of this kitsch Kiwi excursion."
The script by Steven Brill is pure formula and totally predictable. He takes absolutely no chances.
"Protracted, over-emotive yet psychologically depth-free...Pieces seemed to me a perfect, terrible example of transplanted filmmakers failing to grasp an unfamiliar culture."
"Sounds good on flimsy colored paper, but for a comic book adaptation to work onscreen there has to be decent scripting and A-list production values."
"If you're interested in Williams and his music, this film is better than nothing - but not by much."
"In a nutshell, it's just another foul-mouthed, British-flavoured wedding movie with a cast of uncouth young men trying to be as rude as possible."
"Director Stanley Kubrick was obviously just collecting a paycheck for this one, though he stages some intricate battle scenes. Too bad he obviously couldn't have cared less about the lame love story and political machinations behind the scenes."
"Inevitably, the action has to take over, and the film devolves into a frenzy of fireballs and automatic gunfire."
"At its best the film has some of the unadorned, incisive strangeness of the minimalist American fiction of the 1980's, but it also shows the limitations of minimalism, and feels, even in its relative brevity, about half an hour too long."
"It's hard to know what to make of a film such as this, with its implicit message that it takes men to empower women in sports."
"Sometimes, the guilty pleasure makes you mad -- the moments, the ""It has its moments"" moments, are so delectable that it throws into even sharper contrast how godawful the rest of it is."
Ultimately&#44; despite the award-winning 70-something leads&#44; there&apos;s just not much plot or character development to make this messy premise work&#46; 
"Though the film is shorter than two hours, it's so sluggishly paced and uninteresting that it feels as if it's actually several days long."
"When a movie gives up before the one-minute mark, you know you're in for a long haul."
A Prairie Home Companion is about as charming as waking up with a dead animal in your bed.
"Director Clark Johnson has a cast that's up for the challenge, but other aspects are wobbly."

un produit plutôt fade qui essaie énormément sans trop savoir ce qu'il fait.
"Piterbarg works hard to mute the plot's more fanciful elements. If fact, she ends up going too far in the wrong direction, turning this into an underpowered thriller instead."
"Even with Payne's plight as a woman in a vastly male-dominated realm repeatedly thrust to the fore, the film remains general and formulaic."
"Unfortunately, the film's thesis is somewhat thin (bullying sucks!) and Hirsch doesn't present us with any recourse to prevent it besides awareness."
"Unpleasant, humor free, and contrary to accepted codes of movie morality. And that's before it shows its hand as a pile of implausible sentimental mush."
Succeeds when it doesn't try to be too complicated and conventional.
"This is one big, fat schmaltzy drama."
"The four-hour ""Snyder Cut"" doubles down on darkness and Easter eggs instead of compelling storytelling."
"The only separation that exists here is the vast one between good and bad filmmaking, and Separation falls decidedly on the side of the latter."
"Despite the powers of the cast, especially the powerful Ethan and the intense Allen, the drama proves thin and slow as your proverbial molasses in January."
Pride and Glory's commercial setbacks will likely originate from its all-too-familiar storytelling.
Hubie Boucher&#44; I mean Hubie Halloween&#44; tries but can&#8217;t recreate the magic of old-school Sandler comedies&#46; It ultimately misses its mark by recycling more storylines and characters than George Lucas&#46;
"A smorgasbord of strobe lights, screeching soundtrack noises, and silly specters."
Benjamin doesn't quite succeed in demonstrating her premise that life-or-death situations can empower an unwilling victim to become an unexpected hero.

"Inconsistent and weird, The Good Dinosaur is second-level Pixar all the way."
It's camp alright: prison camp.
"This Formula 6 racing flick's tire-spinning in a vacuum: the plausible's passed early on, the ludicrous is smoked down the stretch, and any lingering basic law of action-film gravitas is shredded by the finish line."
"It delivers a thrill or two, perhaps a chuckle, but you'll have forgotten three minutes after you leave the multiplex."
"I'm not saying that this is a good film, just that it has value beyond its inglorious January release."
Perhaps Reitman was so desperate to create the next Ghostbusters and to take advantage of Duchovny's X-Files appeal that he forgot to read the embarrassingly awful script.
"Those hoping for another ""Hangover"" may be disappointed by Todd Phillips' punch-drunk followup, which is basically ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" for the road-rage generation."
"How bad is this one ...? Amazingly so. Villainy abounds, but the villains are strident contrivances. Spider-Man flies, but does so dutifully, without joy."
"Hilariously, casting white Westerners as mortals and deities of the ancient Nile is the least offensive thing about this crime against goofball cinema."
"Why go back and remake a classic unless you can improve upon it in some way or add something new? To my mind, I don't think this did."
"Zombie movies require a certain amount of weirdness or subversiveness to succeed. Turning a zombie pandemic into a generic disaster movie robs the zombies of their dirty, nasty edginess and robs the disaster of its epic scope."
"Leaden with cliches, obvious red herrings and logic-abandoning choices by the lead characters, the Russell Gewirtz script is the proverbial pig in De Niro-Pacino lipstick."
"Expectations for a Meyer Lansky bio-pic are not met with the feature, which only cherry picks a few areas of underworld unrest. The rest of the effort is a mild drama."
"Unless you enter a Giacometti fan, you're doubtful to emerge as one, or to feel any closer to the artist's life."
By its end Youth in Revolt has flown off the tracks completely.
Surely the first law of attraction is that Pierce Brosnan isn't. This is the man who turned James Bond into the kind of guy who owns a juicer.
Not much to get excited about here.
"Is superhero-osity finally exceeding its shelf life at the movies? I know, I know, that sounds ridiculous, but think of how ridiculous a similar question about westerns would have sounded, circa 1955."
"A great cast, but with a story that leaves much to be desired. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Who'd have thought the filmmakers had so little confidence in their audience? Who'd have imagined the finished film would mirror the creative lethargy underpinning it so perfectly? It's slapped together, half-hearted, cynical and tired."
...fun hints about lots of cool things - none of which are fully explored... as if the story by producer James Wan and Gary Dauberman consisted of every unused idea instead of any single good one.
Greta is about 15 years too late to be progressive.
"There is plenty of entertainment to be had, but the formulaic nature of the story progression hinders it from standing out in an already crowded genre."
"Soft, repetitive to a fault, and narrated by its maker in tones of wistful awe that seem totally inappropriate to its subject."
"If this movie was about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars it would be irresponsible. But because it has the buffer of a 70-year remove, it's just dumb."
"Director Ruben Fleischer leans hard on the violence card, but with little return in the way of excitement, and at the expense of character and story."
It's not very funny and tries to buy laughs with puerile shocks.
"This critic is tired of seeing movies in which teenage boys behave awfully for two acts, only to be redeemed in the last few moments by some imbalanced act of kindness."
Shyamalan is straining to achieve the apocalyptic menace that Hitchcock pulled off in The Birds&#44; &#46;&#46;&#46; his would-be successor strives but fails to make us afraid of the grass&#46;

"At the end of it, I got a whiff of shaggy dog."
"This may be the version of this musical that fans want, but... for those not predisposed to like this show it's hard to see that the film will sway them to take multiple journeys ""Into The Woods"""
The film contrives to fill its thin 85 minutes with dicey escape attempts and a fake-out that horror buffs will recall from a better film best left unnamed.
"The film's whole narrative structure begins to disintegrate on the second viewing, if it hasn't already done so on the first."
"The '84 original wasn't Shakespeare by any stretch, but it's practically a nostalgic masterpiece compared to this misguided remake."
"The battle scenes are exercises in nondescript mayhem, and suspiciously bloodless (to qualify, barely, for a PG-13 rating)."
"Flat, unfocused and weirdly random."
"Teller is appreciably committed to the character, but he's only given one note to play, his full-bodied passion wasted on a movie that would rather win on points than go for the knockout."
"Though Tarantino mixes fiction and historical fact cleverly and confidently, I'm not sure what he wanted to achieve with the mix this time, and I'm not sure if he knew either."
Cynical and bitterly cold... [Mike] Nichols and [Buck] Henry fail to make an anti-capitalist film. They have made their case so strong that it becomes an anti-human film.
"The scenes may be embarrassing, but at least Gross can't be accused of playing it safe."
"The movie is an anecdote, not a story."
"This noisy, effects-crazed PG-13 adventure might work for 10 year-olds who are beyond Nickelodeon piffle and ready for Japanese splatter."
There is only one segment out of the entire series of shorts that I even liked... Everything else is soooo actor-y.

...relentlessly mediocre...
A stronger focus on Seberg may have made for a more satisfying film.
"Plays out with all the subtlety of one of those bum-awful ""issues-driven"" episodes of EastEnders. You half-expect an ""if you were affected by the events in this movie, you can call our special helpline"" message to drone out over the end credits."
"It's not often that a Clint Eastwood movie ends and the first words out my mouth are, ""That's it?"""
"By any rational measure, D.C. Cab is pretty terrible...but for all its faults, it's our movie, because it gets the fact that this town has more sides than just the two on either side of the congressional aisle."
"When you come right down to it, 'Tenet' is a mess. A gloriously shot, exquisitely staged mess with a thrilling final act - but still a mess."
"Though the premise is provocative enough, the execution feels like a host of other violent action-drenched movies."
Pandorum doesn't make a whole lot of sense and is shot and edited in a way that only adds to the confusion. In space nobody can hear you scratching your head.
"The substandard components of this film are humorous by today's standards, but unfortunately not hilarious enough to be worthy of a viewing."
A gorgeous but plodding period piece.
"Call Jane is a competently made, well-acted historical drama that doesnt give its charged subject matter the stakes or urgency it needs."
"The filmmaker, although critical of people who expect miracles, who passively wait for someone or something to solve their problems, is not terribly sympathetic to his characters."
"It's really about Lipsky's love of his own words, as every character serves as nothing more than a mouthpiece for identically insipid dialogue."
...so predictable in the way that it manipulates your emotions that it leaves you feeling like the victim of a con game.
"It's a sweet, generic safe harbor for young kids, parents, and those teenagers who want to hide from the world for a couple of hours."
"It's long, uninteresting, and paced like one of those nightmares where you keep trying to run BUT YOU CAN'T! It's that bad."
The movie cannot escape its been-there-shot-that vibe.

The pedestrian script isn't as compelling as the special effects.
"You can imagine how surprised I was that Ross Glass' ""Saint Maud"" was another lagging horror exercise that's sense of dread plays out for 84 grueling minutes with minimal payoff."
"A maddening experience, watching a film with a great kernel of an idea fail to grow into something equally impressive."
Perpetuates a problem that the film fails to acknowledge: Artists' most devoted supporters frequently refuse to oblige their simple request to be left alone.
"The essence of ""Broken City"" is forgettable, and that's its only strength. Once it's over, you won't be bothered to think about it ever again."
A scattershot affair that bobbles along episodically but doesn't quite gel.
"A captivating performance from Tallie Mendel carries an abstract, occasionally muddled storyline to its fitting conclusion."

Young Hadji's silence gives The Search what lasting power it possesses.
"While seeing Reeves reunited with Carrie-Anne Moss is sweetly satisfying...Lana Wachowski (""Cloud Atlas"") rehashes ""The Matrix"" trilogy using copious amounts of old footage and exposition to come to a conclusion most had already arrived at."
There is some fascinating history here and Parker clearly has talent to burn but Birth Of A Nation is unexpectedly boring.
A story with a brilliant conceptual framework that never quite coalesces into a satisfying drama.
It's unbelievable that a movie which cost so much money seems to have been made on the cheap.
This franchise has lost its ability to tell any sort of coherent storytelling and instead chooses to hone in on cartoon absurdity and undoubtedly some of the dumbest cinematic characters imaginable.
"The reason it's exhausting, and ultimately boring, to sit through Alexander-and why the movie is already disappearing from theaters-is that. . .there's no dramatic arc, no shaping of the life into a good story."
This spooky house flick would be better off locked up in the attic and forgotten for good.
"If the job of slaughtered-teenager movies is to dig up talented young actors who will eventually do better movies and wish they hadn't done this one, Venom excels in that area."
Most viewers will find themselves wishing that they had just said nein.
"Any film with Crispin Glover's name above the title is marching to its own beat, and it has little interest in convincing us to dance along; we simply will or we won't."
"All the King's Men has so much going for it, but this Louisiana political drama goes off the rails, wandering through a muddle of momentum-stalling flashbacks and poorly rendered accents."
A triumph of high-concept but low-ambition filmmaking.
"Burning comes out looking somewhat behind on the times. Its interest in the psychosexual makeup of its male characters comes at the expense of its women, who are either removed from the story, or relegated to thinly-written background characters."
Meet the Robinsons has six writers credited to a picture that has maybe five good laughs. And at least four of those writers must have had advanced cases of attention deficit disorder.
"[Director Brady Corbet's] attempt to establish a relationship between pop music and capitalism, terrorism and the socio-economic future of American society in the last two decades is too ambitious and doesn't jell. [Full review in Spanish]"
Competently made.
Abort.
"It seems unlikely that, in an America ravaged by police shootings and generally teetering on the edge of authoritarian dystopia, audiences will be endeared to a pair of gleefully corrupt cops who resort to violence for kicks."
Late in the film engagement saves the pic from a more critical beat down...but not by much. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)

"X-Files: I Want to Believe %u2014 it's almost like a mantra that Chris Carter is trying to get the audience to hear. Say it enough times and they will believe. Well, that's not the case."
Here's the REAL ugly truth: The Ugly Truth is an uninspiring romantic-comedy rehash.
This film has the enervating quality of a wet Tuesday in the arcade.
Merely adequate...[the film] has a plot so old it probably came over on the Mayflower.
Atrociously written by actor Ebbe Roe Smith and atrociously directed (it goes without saying) by Joel Schumacher...
It's as though the scriptwriters already knew the ending ... The result: elliptical and underwritten storytelling.
This Christian-themed domestic melodrama uses race as cheap window dressing for easily digestible bromides and a conclusion as foregone as a Family Circus panel.
"Fun at the start, but can turn into a chore to complete."
"Anderson this time has driven straight into a cul-de-sac, stranding every sort of good and great actor in the cinematic equivalent of a design meeting."
This is little more than a promotional effort to draw kids to the theater to get a free card and then encourage them to buy more of the newly introduced characters.
Does the worst thing any sequel can ever do: it retroactively taints the original and makes it less interesting.
Sing might be passable in a lesser year of animation but the fundamental flaws in the film kneecap it from the beginning.
"Though slick and visibly appealing, this is empty, vapid, and could have been so much more."
"...there is so little new or innovative about it that if you're a normal moviegoer, you've seen it all before."
"For a film whose subject rightfully demands to be seen as more than just a kid, Chef Flynn does way too much coddling."
There's nothing here that the Scream movies didn't do first and better.
Both entirely disposable and frustrating because of how much potential there is in these ideas. But better developed characters and a few less twists could have made this for a more resonant experience.
What's the point in making a documentary about a classic album if you don't have the rights to any of the music?
"While there are moments that impress and amuse, Gringo never quite manages to sustain its momentum."
"As horror, ""Scouts Guide"" is too frivolous to thrill. As comedy, it leans too much on scenes that see the teens groping big-breasted topless zombies or the beasties sexually molesting young girls."
There cannot be many of these back-of-the-envelope-cutesy ideas for rom-coms left.
"This film has the right intentions and a certain quaintness, but feels too dated and unimaginative for its own good, and thus comes off as a flat and uninspired effort."
"As for the ending, put it this way: when you ask an audience to sit for two hours and 20 minutes, it's only polite to give them something for their trouble."
"With gratuitous, weak one-liners and a plot straight out of a ""How to Write A Screenplay In 8 Days"" seminar, [Vice] has little going for it from the outset."
A prime example of Attention Deficit Disorder Filmmaking.
"A lot like Glitter, although Glitter was actually set in the early '80s, and Honey just looks like it is."
Gangster movies should not be mildly interesting.
"Like the appetizers, entrees, and apertifs so lovingly filmed here, The Menu is a fetish object styled as an indulgent antidote to unearned pretension, one meant to be appreciated, not to be enjoyed."
"While Kingsley's character Avram Adareth's musings on a life spent dishing out violence on behalf of a seemingly ungrateful government are quietly compelling, the film offers precious little to get excited about."
"Sentimentality and secretions, with a generous helping of blatant product placement, do not make for the most graceful of holiday entertainments."
"A production this lavish, on the mega-sized Imax screen, should not induce yawns and droopy eyelids."
Expect the usual corny jokes and stereotypical characters.
"After Boyle establishes Damian, his family and his quirky new community, Millions really starts to lag. The imagination gives way to simple subplots."
"Feels old fashioned, like it has been sitting around on a shelf somewhere, hidden from view since the 1990s."
"While the ambitious, bonkers action satisfies, F9 doesn't get to coast on an incoherent story and lazy, repetitive beats that drag out for much longer than a quarter-mile."
"Romain Duris (Paris) is ridiculously engaging... If only the film had trusted in its own premise, instead of succumbing to the blandness of the conventional."
Director David Weaver and co-writer Elan Mastai twist the movie in several different directions before settling for a professional but generic pulp thriller.
Charlize CHASES Kevin with a GUN. Courtney CHASES Stuart with a CELL PHONE. The sound of GUNFIRE and cell phones RINGING.
"Despite all the firepower, the movie is only sporadically exciting."
It's not a lack of originality that makes Shopgirl too Saks for its own good; it's the attempt to make a distinctive item into a blue-light special that betrays it.
"Except for the intercontinental setting, their journey follows a familiar road map, as predictable sentimentality compromises the moments of genuine poignancy."
"Plays out much like a round of golf -- slow, old-fashioned, tediously long, and lacking in drama."
"...July is playing on very dangerous ground here, making potential child molestation into comic plot points."
"To trito sequel mias ap' tis pio dimofileis mythologies stin istoria toy animation, poy apodeiknyetai pera apo ahreiasto, olotela eisitiriothiriko kai safos katotero tis istorias toy kleisimo enos franchise poy ehei, ap' o,ti fainetai, pia eksantlithei."
Wilson works better in ten-minute segments than it does as a complete movie.
"This is a project whose elements, from concept to script to casting, refuse to follow the usual formulas, which is good, yet they never quite cohere."
"if a Vanilla Ice cameo is a highlight, imagine what the rest of the film is like"
"The film itself feels uncertain, compromised and tentative. Those are very different qualities than brash, or bracing, or provocative."
"Shapeless, uninformative and strangely lacking in survival stories."
"Compared to its sister films, the storytelling is stellar, remarkable not because there's a whole lot going on -- in fact, you'll likely leave the theater thinking, ""That's it?"" -- but because what little does happen makes sense."
"Despite the novel setting, the director Andy Fickman has made a visually flat film. The editing is frequently awkward, clunkily overemphasizing physical gags, and lingering too long on the actors as they try to light up dusty material."
"Serious space movies really don't work. ""The Martian"" was a rare exception. After ""Ad Astra,"" everyone should have just stopped."
"It plods along, from one dull scene of mundane 'ordinary' life to the next."
"Despite some accomplished moments of comedy, the film doesn't seek to go in depth with some of its ideas. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Even though Lucky You is sometimes dull and generally thin, there is something winning about the movie's genial lack of ambition."
"Credited as a film that glorifies the notion of honor, friendship, and loyalty, all whilst revisiting the vintage stylings of 60's and 70's ""car-culture"" cinema, it's safe to say that Need For Speed fails on all counts."
"Nearly every line of the script drops from the actors' mouths with the leaden clank of exposition, timed with bad sitcom beats."
You don't wind up thinking much of any of these characters. Sympathy is lost somewhere around the time the frantic camera style makes you dizzy.
[A] deeply misguided film...
To say this movie is smarmy is to understate the case. To say it stinks is more like it.
"Yes, Keke Palmer looks ""cool"", exacting vengeance in a style that would make Cleopatra Jones proud, but none of it feels earned."
"Broadway longevity notwithstanding, 'Les Misérables' is not a great musical. But the current screen version could have been so much better if real singers were used instead of box office draws like Jackman and Crowe."
2012's cutting-edge CGI special-effects technology combine with the campy failings of the worst of the 1950's B-movies making for an unlikely comedy of disaster-epic proportions.
"""I fear I may never see you again,"" Alice laments to the Hatter toward the end of the movie. After one sequel too many, we can only hope she's right."
"I would say words fail me, but they don’t. It’s just that most of them are unprintable."
"Goblet is really just a glorified, 157-minute teaser trailer, an empty epic of proportions that truly stagger."
"If ""Enemy"" is the weakest of the three Villeneuve films I've seen, the problem is its reliance on gratuitous weirdness to do its heavy lifting."
"Phantom of the Opera does not look good, it does not sound good, and it is an astonishing bore."
"A pretty standard, middle-of-the-road drama where the only true spark comes from Ben Affleck's impressive performance. He's the only reason any of the film works."
Narrative has never been Anderson's strength; the story here is a corny overhaul of James Cameron's already-corny Titanic.
"How to Build a Girl never actually settles into a narrative groove, not only periodically changing tones but consistently leaves one questioning if they are even watching the same movie every 15 minutes or so"
"The one distinguishing feature, baked into the film's conceit, is that we get to anticipate the dog dying at the end of every segment, and endure the repeated heartbreak of owners who cannot know its spirit is infinite."
"Mr. Lutz prattles on endlessly about the paranormal activity he says he witnessed, the unpleasant family dynamics he grew up with and more."
Is weighed down by a tediously slow pace and overwrought production values.
"The movie violates its own internal logic and dissolves into worn-out slasher-flick tropes. Too bad; Menear and Bell had a bizarrely good thing going, but they couldn't come up with an ending."
The good thing -- the only good thing -- about Extreme Ops is that it's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my Thanksgiving to-do list.
"A well-meaning, often very funny call for female empowerment in dire need of a script revision and a judicious edit."
"While this raunchy Freaky Friday meets Trading Places has some laughs, it's more often frat-boy crass, frantic and formulaic."
This is a movie with a very specific target audience %u2013 young people who've read the book %u2013 and it will play solely to that demographic.
Director Sydney Pollack is more proficient at generating suspense than following through on it.
"If you want car crashes, ridiculous fights, car crashes, meager acting, car crashes, not much story, car crashes, nice scenery, and car crashes, this is a wild ride."
Thoroughly unentertaining.
"There is a lot of frank conversation about the technical aspects of sex between women, but Holden and Banky are written more like sniggering eighth graders than inquisitive adults."
"Shearer's Victor says that 'Oscar is the backbone of this industry, an industry not known for backbone.' Ironic that his statement could also be the film's very own tagline."
"Where the animated original had an endearingly cheery anthropomorphism, with wide eyes and cute expressions, this lacks that. You're marveling at the beauty of the animals, but it just doesn't work with the material."
Every filmmaker is allowed a few career missteps. Lynn Shelton seems to have spent all hers on just one movie.
"Role Models invites you to celebrate the kingdom as advertised on its website: a ""fantasy world where anything is possible"" at least if you're a boy in need of approval."
"Maguire, an actor I've always admired, is fine as Fischer, becoming more erratic and wild-eyed as his fame grows. However, the script is one-note."
"unnecessary symbolism, quick pacing, and perceived wit were given priority, leaving us with forced banter instead of focused emotional resonance"
"The enjoyment of the film is certainly lessened by the film's darkness, and I don't mean its tonality. "
"As much as 12 Strong tries to focus on its specific moment, there is no escaping the looming shadow of this ongoing conflict."
"Fast-paced and disposable. For action fans, that will be plenty. For those wanting more, look elsewhere."
A black mark on the careers of everyone involved in this mess.
"It's helpful if you walk in with the expectation that it is a genre picture -- not a parody, not camp, but a loving homage to gangster movies of the 1980s like Scarface."
Help me! I can feel my brain rotting.
"Meet the Fockers, a sluggish sequel to the anarchic domestic comedy Meet the Parents, is one visit too many."
This film has a strange air of nada about it.
"A rehash of other, better movies- but for what it is, it's not bad."
Bus 174 is too long because the filmmakers are too timid about making a frontal attack on Brazilian society. Detail becomes a substitute for an open indictment.
Initially intriguing yet ultimately atrocious...
"A crime not just against cinema but all of humanity, it's been a long, long time since a movie made me this mad."
"Despite going in fully expecting and wanting to enjoy this movie, it instead left me vaguely depressed and highly disappointed."
"Throwaway fun that will amuse horror and action lovers, but probably no one else."
"Another few drafts of the script would possibly have salvaged the film, along with a more imaginative ending."
Louisa May Alcott's novel is somewhat dated and somewhat vulgar on the screen. [Full review in Spanish]
This social realist parable lacks bite.
"Though it's destined to be largely forgotten, ""Wish Upon"" is at least watchable."
"First Man, although concerned with a world-historic, world-changing event, has a limited goal and framework..."
"An R-rated gals-night-out comedy that, thanks to the talented cast, delivers a few genuinely amusing moments, but which falls a couple of glasses of chardonnay short of being a good time."
"[T]he dancing fantastic... the sexy is unusually positive... [but] the moment the dancing stops, it all stumbles into the howlingly ridiculous..."
Armstrong turns Sebastian Faulks' pungent novel about World War II into a soporific.
Terrifyingly dull.
"It all becomes repetitive and hollow, both from an action and a plot perspective..."
"It's hard to imagine that the thoroughly mediocre and paint-by-numbers romantic comedy ""Couples Retreat"" was written by the same guy who brought the world Swingers 15 years ago."
"f you're one of the many nerdy high school boys plagued with unpopularity and pimples, you'll adore the underdog story of Kick-Ass. But if you're one of the rest of us, you probably won't."
Charles Durning does the running-with-guns-blazing action hero bit as a homicide detective.
doesn't excel in looking at the human side of its subjects
"Sure, Hemsworth looks great, and the whale's attacks are genuinely exciting. And some of the everyday details of life at sea are fascinating, too, if disgusting. But sorry, maties, but this is the one that got away."
Don't bother travelling to your cinema to see it.
Nan could be a figure of punkish resistance&#44; as Johnny Knoxville&#8217;s Bad Grandpa has proven&#46; But in The Nan Movie&#44; her gags are so engineered toward woke-baiting culture war dialogue&#46;&#46;&#46; that the endeavor is robbed of any true spirit or emotional coherence&#46;
"Visually colorful but dramatically empty, ""Mr. Magorium's Emporium"" is too listless for words."
There's a lot to be said about a family with 12 kids but this film doesn't do any of them justice.
Mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic: two parts exhausting Men in Black mayhem to one part family values.
"Glass would need to be completely reconsidered, script-wise, and then redone from scratch."
"Without the pleasure of watching this star quartet at work, America's Sweethearts would barely be a footnote on the summer of 2001. With them, it's just barely worth staying till the end."
"One can see why those who love the film love it to this day and have such warm memories of it, although those approaching it for the first time may wonder what all the fuss is about."
"This Elvis, despite some attempts to get the formula all shook up, provides as much commentary on its subject as most biopics do for theirs; that is to say, not much at all."
"As an exercise in neo-noir, the film is surprisingly inert, and as a dark comedy, it fails to offer many laughs."
There are so many good ideas at the visual level that you can't help wishing the narrative elements had been more cleverly worked out.
Somewhat of a self-fulfilling title.
"As long as you don't expect too much, Fired Up!'s aim is true enough."
The Promotion is generally harmless but boring.
The acting is sketchy.
"In a lot of ways, ""The Snowman"" is like IKEA made a movie; and then they asked you to assemble it without any instructions."
"Call me the sarcastic sister, but the only thing screaming in any convincing way here are the cheap look, epileptic direction, and off-key, ""edgy"" humor."
"By and large ""Prom"" is exactly what the prom-haters in the cast say it is, a lot of build-up for something that isn't remotely as ""special"" as those obsessed with it wish it to be."
"Among the many unanswered questions, I ask: Where do they find this junk, and where do so many amateurs get the money to finance it?"
"If Soderbergh wanted to expose the business up close and personal with the sincere simplicity of a mere camera lens, then couldn't he have accomplished this feat without the sledgehammer direction of a labored and obvious spoof?"
"A dull, confusing movie for which nobody bothered to provide a script."
"Earnest but earthbound...a slow, soggy, soporific, visually dank crime melodrama/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast."
"Lacking tangible emotional depth, and, frankly, much laugh-out-loud humor at all, The Opening Act is surprisingly underdeveloped for an intimate story about ambition and sacrifice."
There's absolutely nothing wrong with this movie that a good story wouldn't fix.
[C]learly was not written by someone taking this best-you-can-be pill... It's not awful. It's passably entertaining. But it thinks it's taking risks yet never goes out on any ledges.
The directors care very little about story development. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Leder returns to the big screen with an effort that feels intended for the small screen. While it tells a great story...""On the Basis of Sex"" feels like a Lifetime movie."
The pleasure of caper movies lies partly in the suspense of watching the puzzle pieces of a convoluted plan fall into place and partly in the group chemistry. Army Of Thieves has neither.
"It shorts its audience on the rich and vibrant experience it continually hints at, and for a horse that is rightly regarded as one of the greatest pure athletes who ever lived this is one race Secretariat doesn’t win."
The cast is FAR funnier than the script or direction.
"[T]he movie is founded on a few fantasies: that Josie would basically wait for Liam, that the right woman can change a terrible guy, and that we're supposed to find any of this romantic."
"Management isn't even a good stalker-training film. It's pretty much a waste of everyone's time, especially yours."
Most of The Ballad of Jack and Rose takes itself too seriously.
"With so many of the mutant heroes so outrageously gifted, it's hard to believe that anyone is ever in any real danger."
"It's a lively picture, but never a memorable one."
"Tom Clancy's Without Remorse may never generate a sequel, but your dad is likely to enjoy this one quite a bit, if he can get on Prime Video."
...a comic-book adaptation that could (and should) have been so much better.
"Macy is on top form and Mamet fans will savour the vicious barbs of repressed male rage but many will find this is a claustrophobic, stagey exercise without the wit and scope of Glengarry Glen Ross."
This somewhat thin documentary revisits a story of athletic rivalry that marked the careers of two runners and in some ways overshadowed their other achievements.
One of the weaker Disney animated films.
This Magnificent Seven seems a bit underdeveloped character wise.
There's nothing really new or unexpected.
"Poor dialogue, predictable scenes and even more predictable and useless characters in predictable situations. [Full review inSpanish]"
"Unfortunately, director Tom Vaughan appears determined to deliver every minute detail of the Crowleys' story."
"Why does the film fall so flat? Partly it's the fatally tasteful indie aesthetic, evident in everything from Benjamin Speed's ambient score to Bryan Mason's digital cinematography, which aims for ''muted'' and ends up at ''drab''."
"Well, it's the sequel that no one asked for, but now we have. Maybe I'm too ""grown up"" for this franchise"
Unforgettable is very forgettable.
"It seems too enamored with the seductive notion of an honorable criminal, too ready to take Bulger's justifications as actual indications of his relative innocence."
"Vigalondo goes for a comedy of errors scenario dressed in the exhausted aliens landing in the neighborhood routine. However, when charm is the only gasoline in the engine, patience wears thin in 90 minutes."
A black comedy that rings hollow today.
[click to read review in Greek]
"Unlike Hanks in Big, there's little consistency to [Garner's] character."
"But, sadly, it's not a good movie."
"The director squanders a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to film on the grounds and inside the Palace of Versailles. It's the trappings we get, in richly reproduced costumes and all-over gilt furniture, at the expense of any substance."
"It starts off at a good pace to tell a crime story based on real events in Argentina, but unfortunately along the way it loses the fun factor as the master robbery cuts through the accommodating and predictable grounds. [Full review in Spanish]"
...too many special effects; not enough suspense or frights.
While Tomorrowland's sermonizing left me feeling grumpy... it may well have an entirely different effect on impressionable children.
"Both versions of Funny Games force the audience to eat it, really eat it, and while they're eating it, to think about the mechanics and the narrative tropes of a typical revenge drama."
An inpspired Alan Arkin and a great Cuban soundtrack can't make up for fuzzy politics and a limp script.
"Some decent laughs. but most of the movie's forced and awkward. Tara Reid and Mena Suvari, in particular, look as if they'd rather be anywhere else."
Gerry is a fascinating idea for a movie -- can you make a movie so boring that it transcends boredom? -- but not a fascinating movie.
Warrior is a good-looking film that feels more like an allegory about the power of positive thinking than a drama.
"You have to wonder how different today's live action comic book landscape would look if ""Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D"" took off as a hit series, don't you?"
The film never gives you a real sense of what drove Darin on.
The musician biopic craze dies right here; bury it to the left of Jennifer Lopez's once significant career.
Formulaic to the core.
"This movie isn't horrible, but it seems like a waste for Zombie to keep revisiting someone else's world."
This could be a satire of an entitled generation if the characters weren't so vapid.
"A superficial movie about beautiful people, when it needed to be a beautiful film about superficial people. Lacks the magic of Coppola's best movies."
...its status as an event picture and insistence upon live action mar what should have been a delightful romp.
Lost Souls doesn't even give us a good exorcism.
"The lone minority character is a complete fool and the onscreen kids either mock or fear the overweight, both pretty monstrous messages to send to a young audience."
"Maybe the $200 million went towards Craft Services, its certainly not up on the screen. I honestly don't know if I liked it or not. I will say it's the best video game movie ever, but that's damning the movie with faint praise."
Like being stuck in the middle of a NASCAR race...without a car.
"This trashy agenda could have a certain appeal if it were executed with wry humour or nightmarish obsessiveness -- as in, say, De Palma's Dressed To Kill -- but this time around the whole thing feels so vapid, so dated."
So pandering and pebble-brained you'd guess it had been test-screened on barnyard animals.
"Just as the comedy scenes aren't funny, the action scenes aren't thrilling. Natasha never seems as if she's in any danger. She never seems like she's having fun, either."
"They [director Ridley Scott and star Russell Crowe] may have had a good time making the film, but I can't say I did while watching it."
"If you're looking for emotional complexity, Penguin Bloom is not for you. Even Watts can't turn Penguin Bloom into anything more than a familiar tale made more disarming by the presence of a magpie."
"The cumulative result of all of these disasters is a weak, ugly, forgettable science fiction movie."
An Inconvenient Sequel simply doesn't catch you up the way the original did.
"It's a delight until the weirdly adult-like child grows up to be a childish adult: Farrell, wearing a caveman wig as a stud version of Chance the Gardener..."
Excruciatingly unamusing.
The film never rises to exceptional heights with its visuals and doesn&#8217;t quite have the moving writing Knoll was praised for when she wrote her book&#46;&#10;&#10;
"Though Ms. Seyfried is a lovely actress, her inexperience shows in her climactic scenes, which aren't written very well to begin with, while Mr. Tatum's stolid reserve decays into dull passivity."
Spectacularly stupid.
"Face it, tiger: Primal is boring."
"[Director] Penn has crucially miscalculated, mistakenly assuming we'd rather watch comedic actors play poker instead of watching them be funny."
This search for love and self worth is affectionately offbeat but strains as it plunges into violence.
"Lost in a ""sea of individuality,"" the hero evolves, devolves, and is born again. It's a painless, not highly memorable journey that is tailor-made for Young Christian discussion groups -- and that is not bad in itself."
"Ramos gives a powerful and raw performance, but never reveals what makes Joao who he is, what drives him both to violence and to vibrant self-expression."
Without any sense of a person at the heart of the story&#8212;not even the person&#44; just a person&#8212;Blonde is nothing more than empty spectacle&#44; another magnet for the fridge&#46;
Flash Point plays like the last hurrah of a criminal underclass facing the inevitable shrinking of its bottom line.
There are just endless gags aimed at 11-year-old boys.
Better luck trying to find out what truly happened to the real Earhart than trying to diagnose all that's wrong with this hapless film.
Like its band of zealots&#44; Shyamalan&#8217;s movie is insistently menacing with a patina of compassion and empathy&#46;
Bloated and overlong.
"Sadly, Snyder hasn't learned from past mistakes, stirring in more dreary Batman premonitions, sequel-baiting subplots and a comeback for Jared Leto's worst-ever Joker."
A florid biopic about St. Theresa of Lisieux.
The fact that the rescue process inadvertently kills off more people than it saves tends to lessen the tension by utterly devaluing human life.
This is the Marvel way&#58; The studio recruits actors and directors for their distinctive qualities&#44; but over time the thing that stuck out  gets filed down&#44; until they&apos;re just part of the machine&#46;  Ant-Man and the Wasp&#58; Quantumania is more of the same&#46;
The result is breathtakingly dumb with absolutely zero redeeming features.
Ryan Gosling is so good that he manages to rise above the limitations of the script.
Like Freddy Got Fingered with cafeteria food replacing the body excretions.
I can&apos;t remember ever wanting to walk out during a press screening of any post-2008 Marvel movie&#44; but I had the urge this time around and wouldn&apos;t have missed much had I followed that impulse&#46;
"Redbelt fails on nearly every level, from its incoherent story line to its threadbare action sequences."
Wes Anderson's latest is inventive. But its spiralling narrative digressions and whimsy are more exhausting than moving.
"Alas: the film is dull as tombs, partly because it's very hard to make the work of actually writing and editing look fun or even just interesting (I speak here from some knowledge)."
"For all the bad behavior on display, the emotional stakes remain hazily defined."
"While some of its antic set pieces are genuinely funny, this fuzzy-focus outing is hopelessly disconnected and ultimately unsatisfying."
"The film's entire premise is highly self indulgent. Penn's performance, while striking and commendable, is overly mannered.. There's a mascara truckload of interest at work, but only an eyelash of satisfaction"
The film sets up so many ground rules for how its own plot is supposed to work before systematically throwing them all away that it has the feel of an exquisite corpse writing style that eventually resembled a horror movie.
"""Afflicted"" is as emotionally involving as a really accomplished special-effects sizzle reel."
"Micmacs never bores -- Jeunet keeps the pace brisk and the mood ridiculous -- but the movie piles on the whimsy so tirelessly, you eventually start to choke on it."
"The film's got issues, but it's a sincere, mournful celebration of a country that turned the pain of loss into strength."
"A Reagan-era screed against affirmative action, Police Academy warns what misfits and lowlifes wait to pour through the floodgates."
"Hard-hitting social commentary is not [Baz Luhrmann's] forte and while he strives for analogy and pertinence, all is lost in a dust cloud of galloping horses and magical realist swish."
Unsuitable for all ages.
Bliss flounders any time it tries to be profound - even if scientist Bill Nye and philosopher Slavoj iek make brief cameos.
"You're obviously supposed to root for Dudley to triumph, but his character remains nothing more than a clumsy, accident-prone doofus."
Too much of the film lacks sufficient conflict and an organic sense of storytelling.
Scahill's so busy Being A Reporter - capital letters are definitely called for - it gets in the way of what he's reporting on.
"Anyone can make a bad movie, but it takes a good filmmaker to make one as bad as I'm Not There."
A shallow and easily-forgettable thriller.
"Nobody really wanted Home Sweet Home Alone, which is as charmless as it is pointless. There's no life to these characters or real heart in this plot."
"Forest Whitaker turns in one of his sleepiest performances; no one else seems to be trying very hard either, yet director Olivier Megaton delivers some good chases, fist fights, and shots of Neeson looking glum."
"22 Jump Street could be the greenest comedy sequel of the new century so far, a movie that takes recycling crime caper clichés to absurdist extremes."
Torture porn for housewives.
What the Disney movie Tombstone told far more entertainingly in half the time six months ago is doled out like sores from God's own saddle in Kasdan's portentous treatment.
"There's a shortage of magic in this adventure fantasy, and despite some good elements including its spectacular Italian settings and a solid cast, this adaptation about storybook characters prised from their world, is a bit of a blot"
All but sucks away the drama in favor of scenes of the artist creating his work.
Bursts with energy but not inspiration.
"This is half a good movie held hostage to the other, trashier half, and unfortunately for all of us, no rescue seems forthcoming."
This is one bugged-out burlesque you can easily close the iron door on.
"Who are we supposed to root for, or is it all about the explosions and hunky guys showing off their well groomed eyebrows?"
"It's grabbing you by the lapels and screaming, 'Laugh!'"
"With writing like this, can an Academy Award be far behind?"
'Please feel sorry for me' buttons don't make great comedy
"While individual scenes work well, the whole simply defies belief. And, because of this, the final polemic which suggests that London, constantly renewing itself, will never be defeated, simply appears hopelessly sentimental."
"The makers are left, finally, a few cookies short."
"Coarse, clunky, jerry rigged, and -- worst of all -- not funny."
...the effects throw us into physics-defying action so preposterous that one half of the movie undermines the other.
"'Beware the film of Mary Shaw's; it had no scares, only flaws.'"
"Because Bella does a half-hearted attempt to understand Jacob's lycanthropy compared to the half-assed job she did trying to comprehend Edward's vampirism, it has less than half the intrigue of the first movie."
Taking Lives is the eleventh Angelina Jolie film I've seen and the eleventh one to fail on some level or another.
A film that wants to be both simultaneously slick and tender and misses both by a country mile.
"[T]oo stagey, and yet it lacks the vital energy of the stage production it is adapted from..."
"Splits the difference between a feature and a half-hour TV episode, and manages to feel both draggy and slight in the process. "
Self-serving baloney reminiscent of Errol Morris's Robert McNamara documentary
The defenestration of one of England's greatest dramatists by one of Germany's poorest.
"Gangster Squad is never bad, and only rarely is it uninvolving, but the slight entertainment it provides comes coupled with a fair amount of tedium"
A lot of fun on the so-bad-it's-good level of unintentional hilarity.
"The Hitchcockian set-up quickly gives way to a series of set-pieces that evoke the spirit of Woo - balletic gun play, motorbike action and of course fluttering doves - without delivering the stirring emotions that are supposed to come with them."
"At least the Scary Movie features had a budget and filmmakers with some genre battle scars. Stan Helsing is more Friedberg/Seltzer territory: random, agonizingly desperate, and dripping with laziness."
"Forster has made a film that's sanitized and bland, replacing passion with maudlin melodrama."
Kudos to Ethan Hawke for giving Moreno her first starring role after her Academy Award nominated performance in Maria Full of Grace.
Plays like an uneventful three hundredth episode of a soap opera that you've never seen before.
...just as mediocre and gratingly unfunny as its predecessor...
"Atkinson revives the comic secret agent that he first introduced in a series of TV ads in the UK, but this thin script gives him nothing remotely like a rebirth."
"A vile, morally repugnant lump of coal. One of the worst, most disingenuous Christmas movies in memory."
"Whatever they pay these movie stars to keep a straight face, it's not enough."
"In Clone Wars, one battle seems exactly like the last (and the next): the 'droids shoot like amateurs and the Republican troops always prevail, whatever the odds."
"The answers to its most intriguing puzzles disappoint, and the final motive provided for this near-perfect scheme can only be described as flawed."
... too often feels like a calculated and ill-conceived exercise.
So pathetically average that you can barely muster the energy to have an opinion about it.
C-grade exploitation executed in A-plus form.
"Noyce surprisingly prefers slick surface treatment to cutting into the bones-deep legacy of South Africa's racial division. Nuanced performances and gripping laments are wasted on a sleek, empty action climax."
Interesting premise. Terrible execution. This is a James Franco trap. [Full review in Spanish].
Some provocative ideas swirl around this low-budget Australian thriller but never jell into a suspenseful finished product.
There's nothing flawless about this clunker.
Nobody is mean in this movie. They talk very loud.
"The familiarity wouldn't matter if the gags weren't so belabored and, thanks to the PG-13 rating, neutered."
"Earnest to a fault and depressing beyond reason, the film is unrelenting in its attempts to wrap the world in a shroud of fatalism."
No good.
"When they aren't focusing on patent law, the remaining hour and 45 minutes strain mightily to come off as wacky, but they're mostly a mess not even the Miracle Mop could clean up."
Feels as if it was written by people who don't play video games.
"There are a couple of good ideas here, but nothing transcendent or exciting. It's basically like seeing the rain fall outside. [Full review in Spanish]"
"A charmless, leaden tale that never gets off the ground, even when its characters soar through the air."
"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but unfortunately Snyder's Watchmen is not nearly as special as Moore and Gibbons' graphic novel. Just please take it easy on me. As they say, don't shoot the messenger. Right?"
"It's hard to say exactly who the audience is for this packed-to-the-brim, sci-fi/action-adventure/family romp."
"This edgy, despairing depiction of four men's mid-life crises disintegrates into a soggy mess."
The snag here is that these two characters need each other in terms of drama&#46;&#46;&#46;
"There's a vacuum at the heart of ""Passing"" that not even Eduard Grau's uncommonly gorgeous black-and-white cinematography can fill."
"The movie feels like it is perpetually in conflict, torn between its desire to be both a light-hearted fable and a dark black comedy."
"Marshall and his team painstakingly recreate, and in some cases re-enact, elements of the beloved classic, but Returns has a sense of forced nostalgia, often more cloying than charming."
"The story is sad and pathetic, unbelievable for more than a second to anyone with less than 45% alcohol in his or her blood stream."
"Enquanto seus realizadores contam o dinheiro que ganharam com o projeto, farei o mesmo que fiz com relao aos dois primeiros captulos: publicarei este texto e esquecerei imediatamente do filme que o tornou necessrio."
"Holofcener's writing is bright, and the individual sequences are engaging and sometimes touching, but as a whole never achieves any significant insight or depth."
It occupies its own special corner in multiplex hell.
This has a very interesting first person action flare&#44; that swings &amp; takes some very daring chances&#46; But the transitions&#44; editing&#44; &amp; heavy CG don&apos;t lend the film any chances of re-watchability because you fail to appreciate the general action and story
"Star Trek Into Darkness is a high octane but messily plotted romp, with solid performances papering over plot holes you could pilot a galaxy-class starship through."
"Solid cast and the occasional chuckle notwithstanding, this movie is wildly uneven, chugging this way and that before careening off track."
Suffers badly from an emotional aimlessness.
"There's something to be said here, but ""Queenpins"" barely scratches the surface of its story and has Bell overstraining herself to generate laughs."
"In every imaginable way, this is a lesser film than the original."
D.E.B.S. is so unflinchingly cute that it forgets to be either funny or flat-out satiric.
"Veering between gruesome villains and silly humor, the film never quite figures out what works and when enough's enough."
"The problem lies with Hart himself. He's a bit of a cypher, highbrow yet bland; the film never gives us a reason to care about him or the mess he gets himself into."
The movie feels more like a cavalcade of personalities than anything resembling a story.
"By encouraging famously subtle actors to give recklessly over-the-top performances, the director distances their characters sharply from the world they inhabit."
"Long on visual affections and unexamined smut but short on insight, the film's view of human behavior is as offensive as it is preposterously simpleminded."
There's a germ of an interesting idea in here about privilege that is only glancingly touched upon... But it gets buried under preposterous twists.
You wish that Linklater had less of the slacker in his filmmaker soul and maybe more of the spirit of early Warner Bros.
"McKellen's character tells them 'you two are anything but dull.' Alas, the same can't be said about the film."
"When not even Sean Connery in a role tailor-made for him can spark a movie into life, you know something's gone terribly wrong."
Godzilla vs. Kong is a mishmash of fun titan fights and asinine human elements. How that combination sits with you will determine if it's a satisfying blockbuster or not.
"It has all the nuance of a sharpie-scrawled slur on a locker. It's pacing is atrocious with scenes colliding together like drunken brunchers, without grace or intention."
Adequate perhaps for a matinee on a dull weekday - but only if the senior discount applies.
"Once you get past Urban's magnificent performance, it doesn't feel much like the Mega-City One we expect."
"There's a good idea here, in the story of helpless victims who get caught up in citizen vigilantism. But it's buried under a cheap, straight-to-DVD esthetic."
Drag queens are no longer funny just because they're drag queens; we've lost the nervousness about gender that once made us need to laugh at a man in drag.
"The picture seems...a rehash--a well-cooked one, perhaps, but a rehash nonetheless."
It's both impressive and sad that the 1987 original is still the high water mark of the series. The latest installment won't challenge for the throne and isn't a contender.
"I applaud Universal for not giving Diesel the money to de-age himself. I applaud the tiny, sporadic surprises this film offers. I applaud that I never have to watch it again."
Kapadia seems more enraptured by country-crossing movement and breathtaking locations than the details of two people in love.
Filler Queen.
"It's weird to be living in a time where a movie like ""Marry Me"" doesn't warrant a recommendation but you desperately want it to succeed. "
The end result can best be described as a rubbish knock-off of Black Mirror made by someone who's clearly never played a video game in their life.
"A Haunted House 2 will satisfy only the basest of humours, while simply repulsing (or offending) the rest of us."
"My favorite performance in the film comes from Bruce Dern, enthusiastically loopy as the booze-soaked town doctor. You can rarely accuse Bruce Dern of phoning it in."
"It accumulates simplistic conceptual repetitions, other grossly emotional ones, unworthy music and some super impressions that, again, make us doubt about who the real Van Sant is. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"It doesn't have the kind of flair, impact or resonance we've come to expect from the director."
It's nothing you haven't seen a hundred times before
...essentially serves as the setup for the far superior Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior.
They went to the trouble of making a life-sized replica of a female elephant's reproductive system ... [D]o you even have to ask whether or not the male prosthetic functions?
The Bone Collector never comes close to the moral chill of Seven or even the step-by-step fascination generated by any number of HBO true-crime shows.
"From its war-is-hell opening to an anti-climactic ending, the lengthy film, director Gary Ross, and star Matthew McConaughey likely would have been better served with a History Channel miniseries."
This horror comedy muffs both the humor and the drama.
"The principal complaint, artistically, about Cruising is that it is not very clear at the rudimentary level of exposition of character and event. The problem... is in a script that never seems sure enough what it wants to say or prove."
"Over-the-top, zany and refreshingly unconventional, but it's too exhausting and overstays its welcome."
"Despair does absolutely nothing worth doing, but it does succeed in one area where several hack directors before him failed: bagging a bad performance from Dirk Bogarde."
Mush [that] comes with an unappetizing side order of condescension and contempt.
Most of the stunts are digital and the pleasures are video-game-stupid.
[T]he film is also catastrophically hampered by the need to dramatise and visualise the audible thought processes of every male character...
Trapero copies all the tricks of American gangster films... But he doesn't bring anything fresh to the table and doesn't explore the characters' motivations for murder past the obvious clichs.
"We remain outside the fourth wall looking in but are never drawn in; bemused perhaps, even agreeably complaisant, but never entirely amused."
"An unfunny, unromantic attempt at a sex comedy with some of the most boring bedroom scenes ever filmed."
"Even as fan worship, it has a bemusing insincerity, or perhaps you could say that it’s shallow worship: mere lip-service to the cult of Cage."
The film begins to entangle itself. [Full review in Spanish]
"Advertises itself as edgy and titillating, but proves fatally tepid and boring."
"Although expertly acted and photographed, A Coffee in Berlin is a drifting deadpan comedy that could have used a shot of caffeinated energy."
Scores around six on the logarithmic PH scale - Paddywhackery Hazard - that leads from acceptable neo-realist films at one to the herb we won't mention again at 10.
"David Gordon Green is attracted to those who seem resigned to tired lives, but only as a symbol for why we must struggle against resignation."
It's a swoony gem of an idea; too bad this Dick is so limp.
Brooks proved that increasing the vulgarity level doesn't necessarily translate into more laughs. Gag after gag falls flat in this potty-mouthed dud.
A gothic mystery that not only owes a great creative debt to the stories of Edgar Allen Poe but also features him as a supporting character&#44; director Scott Cooper&apos;s latest is an inherently goofy movie undone by delusions of grandeur&#46;
Emblematic of a US comedy scene that's turning into something of a fraternity.
"Let's be honest -- harmless it may be, but bad it most certainly is."
"The bottom line is that Staying Alive is nowhere as good as its 1977 predecessor, Saturday Night Fever."
"The Aeronauts may have enough material to deliver a visual feast, but the period piece's beauty and spirit, while undeniable when soaring thousands of feet above the earth, hits some waves of stale air along the way."
"Without looking it up, I'm guessing the title is Latin for drudgery."
The movie has that 'shiny-object-syndrome'... it tends to get easily sidetracked by things that aren't important to the story.
"While this umpteenth variation on the 'supernatural-or-psychological?' horror film theme has an interesting pedigree, mature style and muted tone, it goes nowhere special as if running through molasses."
"The novelty of ""found footage"" wore off almost immediately upon arrival, and yet the ""style"" persists, despite the fact (or maybe because of the fact) that it's tired and lazy."
"I Am Legend is carried for a long while on the strength of Smith's performance, but even he can carry it only so far."
"'Beautiful Creatures' is stylish, campy fun at times."
"""Can we please stop with the remakes of Murder on the Orient Express?"" I ask upon exiting Kenneth Branagh's fatally tepid new reading of the Agatha Christie classic."
"Despite its shortcomings, Cape of Good Hope is a hopeful piece of humanism that is difficult to begrudge too much."
"Short on laughter, the fun seems fake. Pouts and shouting are hard to take. Three lovely stars try acting their best. Yet humor fails the comedy test."
"However brazenly it challenges audience expectations, Palindromes contributes little to such dialogue except more unfocused rancor."
The Brits are the heroes and&#44; in a movie set in Ireland that uses our mythology as a paper-thin backdrop for meaningless violence&#44; this is a cardinal sin&#46; 
Another bittersweet film about boys growing up and demystifying women that disappointingly short-changes its female characters.
Have shifting trends managed to make this particular kind of disposable Hollywood entertainment look novel again?
The glimmer of originality sparked in The Boy is stripped away here in favour of morphing the story into a standard creepy doll haunted house movie.
"Despite stunning visuals, a satisfying score, and three all-in lead performances, ""Out of the Furnace"" is still bleak, lifeless and excruciatingly slow."
"It's bright and colourful with a throng of ultra cute marine characters but the film is a pale imitation of its precursor Finding Nemo, never replicating its magic or touching our heartstrings."
It's just off enough to lumber along.
"Ach. Oy. Woe and poo, bleccch and uck! ZZZZZ-zzz."
"Audiences once packed theaters to gawk at the future; now, it's to soak in the past. The emphasis is on packing in as much nostalgia as possible and tersely editing it together to resemble a film."
The last third plays so much better than the first half that it suggests that Roberts should have abandoned all caution and really gone for a more consistently over-the-top film based in the emotion that he clearly wants to foster.
"Unless you have an unquenchable desire to see blood streaming down Patricia Arquette's face over and over, there's no reason to see Stigmata."
Ultimately a forgettable entry in the young-adult genre.
A movie that doesn't quite live up to its own ambition
"The abiding sensation, at the end, is one not of fulfillment but of exhaustion."
"At this rate, the next sequel might turn out to be a genuinely good movie."
Michael B&#46; Jordan is competent behind the camera and the boxing scenes remain a highlight of the trilogy with the addition of Jonathan Majors as a welcomed newcomer&#44; but the story struggles as the film finds itself on the ropes with little room to move&#46;
"Lies is a turgid Middle Eastern thriller, firing blanks as an action submission and presenting a wet match to light the fire of political discourse."
Never met a cliché it didn't like.
Five Feet Apart is basically the bloodless horror flick nobody asked for.
"Usually you can laugh with a bad movie it or laugh at it. But Snakes on a Plane is laughing at you. It not only fulfills the low expectations of its title, it Tasers them into submission."
One thing lost in Karastan seems to have been a certain element of humour.
While it's relatively short at 80 minutes -- which means it can be watched to just pass time without too much commitment -- Sentinelle still feels like another half-baked work that suffers from a poorly written script and generic fight scenes.
"Thin, superficial and sentimental."
"The film projects rather than develops, indicates instead of embodying. It is dramatically inert and because of that consistently fails to compel the audience."
The selective charm of this badass brawn-fest might be lost on the non-action crowd after the initial novelty value subsides.
This might actually be worse than the TV show.
"If anyone made a single rational decision it would be over in eight minutes, instead of the 80-some minutes that feel like 800."
"Ultimately, Joshy claims to be a story in defense of its main character's right to a story all his own, even though the film never steps away from him long enough to make us consider that this was even a palpable threat."
...teen idol Ueto...is not believable as a warrior for even a second.
Conventional drama about an ex-pat retired American professor mourning his beloved wife's passing benefits from always watchable star Michael Caine. But widespread web availability and familiar treatment of material...will spell mild box office.
"Offbeat, and powered by a game cast, but also full of spun-off asides and backstories that aren't smoothly integrated into the final product, or made to have forward-reaching consequences."
"Even at its very best, it's just all right."
"Just look at little Lindsay Lohan, all grows up, doing romantic comedy like a big girl. It's just a shame Just My Luck is just too inane for words."
"Functions less as a story than as a catalog of references meant to interest a young audience: mixed martial arts, parkour, X-games, Red Hook, Chinatown, D.I.Y. filmmaking."
So imperfect that it may qualify as one of the summer's worst movies.
"There's so much going on in Fantastic Beasts that after the first act, you almost can't be bothered to care what happens next."
"[The premise is] squandered in a slapdash, scattershot sendup that turns almost everyone into nincompoops, trivializes everything it touches, oozes with self-delight, and becomes part of the babble and yammer it portrays."
"The theme seems to be a kind of late-Edwardian Euro whimsy along Wodehousian lines... except that Wodehouse was really funny, and Anderson really isn't."
"The moves feel flat, the editing is choppy and the fight sequences lack the inventiveness of Chan's best work."
"A ropey film can be saved by a great ending; this is not that movie, but the closing scene is unexpectedly moving."
What's astonishing about such an assemblage of interesting material is that it's all pretty dull. There's something almost admirable about making a two-headed dog dull.
Little more than 120 minutes of nifty storm sounds.
"Any hopes of stylistic experimentation or genre fusion are quickly dashed and it becomes evident that this is simply two films: the first half singing, dancing Bollywood and the second a middle-of-the-road martial arts flick."
Apatow keeps making these pointless arrested-development comedies. He hires big-name cinematographers... so his films look a notch above. But in the end the purposelessness of his efforts becomes grating.
"A so-so family sports comedy that aims a weak satirical kick at the divided soul of the American middle-class dad, as personified by Will Ferrell."
"All the groundwork in the world, though, can't alter the fact that a film which began in the style of Ken Loach has turned into Death Wish 3."
The story would not be very compelling if you replaced the character John Lennon with a character named John Smith.
"The men get lost in the muddy palette of earth tones... and the staccato strobe-vision of battle scenes that simply confuses the action, and the story along with it."
"The story is slow, obvious, and repetitive. [Full Review in Spanish]"
This work manages to dehumanise an entire region while providing little entertainment value.
"Like a dodgy old motor, this smutty comedy about car salesmen roars with life to begin with but putters to a stop all too soon."
SRK gets to play the bad boy again in DON 2 and that can be fun at times&#46; But overall&#44; this overly long Indian OCEAN&#8217;S ELEVEN meets MISSION&#58; IMPOSSIBLE offshoot is just a bit too bland&#46;
"Dr. Frankenstein, I presume. Move over, Max Headroom."
"A rare, but pronounced disappointment from director Ang Lee."
Almost entirely reliant on star Bill Murray to crank up his cocktail-hour charms and save the day while the production slumps from one scene to the next.
The film remains a basic case of a cliched story undermining strong performances.
"Killer Elite had potential to be a really interesting, action-heavy political thriller. Sadly, it never really tries to be anything more than another vehicle for Jason Statham."
All the elements of Freaks worked against each other. The movie fell absolutely flat.
"The movie features some terribly underdeveloped characters, [but] the showy musical numbers and a great debut from Christina Aguilera make it a lot more enjoyable than you might believe."
"Solemn, inflated and dull."
Ross Bagdasarian's enduring characters are a bit tougher to endure in this charmless sequel.
It loses direction as Harris' rage is channelled through some clunky plot developments.
"It's evident early on that this is a scam, though the extent of the movie's con is surprising."
"As alleged horror films go, this one is about as scary as the Bowery Boys in Spooks Run Wild."
Disaster movies are trim and exciting or they&apos;re nothing&#44; and &quot;Deep Impact&quot; isn&apos;t trim or exciting&#46;
"Lack of sympathy for the beautiful but flaky heroine undermines the dramatic framework of ""House"" like a swarm of hungry termites."
Che is a heroic guerrilla project in its way. It's just that these guerrillas get lost in a mist of opaque purpose and ill-defined movie mission.
The only real acting in this movie comes from Janet McTeer and Charles Dance as Will's aggrieved parents. They bring some ballast to this blubberfest.
The screenplay never comes to grips with the fact that Connor IS A LOATHSOME HUMAN BEING.
"Weaves a spell over you, with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger. But its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell."
"You'll admire the veteran actor for his work here, but you'll wish the rest of the film surrounding him was as good and interesting as he and his character are. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
"Duchovny is in big trouble every frame of the way. His characters ring false, his scenes seem improperly motivated in a glaring way, and his distasteful obsession with imagery of unflushed cigarette butts bobbing in a toilet is beyond inexplicable."
"[Emiliano Rocha Minter] has realised that when one mixes two genres, each of which generally plays to a separate group of critics, one can create the illusion of innovation."
It's a shame. The worst part is that you can see what War Dogs could have been.
"""The Hustle"" is a great example of why audiences deserved more than a gender-swapped remake with but a few updated details."
"Some jokes work, some don't and, frankly, I can't remember either, but it leaves a sweet aftertaste. Slight, but sweet."
My biggest complaint about this latest adventure in Middle-earth is that it is three hours worth of set-up for the next movie.
We see a doctor pulling a blanket over the little corpse in the crib. We're struck by the shamelessness of this shot.
The complex and fascinating social circumstances that surrounded the creation of what has come to be known as the vibrator hardly gets the realism it's due in this butchered history.
Cameron Crowe used to make wonderful movies.
These satires work best when the actors show at least a morsel of sympathy for their targets. With Mascots condescension reigns supreme.
"This year's Superhero Movie isn't as epically bad as last year's Epic Movie, but it does provide more evidence that the spoof genre is tapped out."
Sienna Miller is a formidable centrepiece in the drama about a couple forced to review their relationship history after a car crash. But she is held down by a story that feels like it was clipped together in a rush.
"Embraces its disposable B-movie leanings, but remains mediocre even under these modest prospects."
&#46;&#46;&#46;an epically-misguided trainwreck that couldn&#8217;t possibly be less interesting or involving&#46;
"There's little in the movie to like, either for tween girls or the unlucky parents who accompany them."
"While not a messy film, Juliet is persistently hollow, diving into a dopey rom-com conclusion (with cutesy Shakespearean overtones) that merely confirms the insipid direction at hand."
"Director Zucker is unsuccessful in trying to put a fresh angle on the familiar story, and he is not much helped by his romantic leads, Richard Gere and Julia Ormond."
"You'll know who the target audience is when you discover the story's setting is called Planet Drool, and the hero is an imaginative schoolboy who joins the title characters to fight the evil Mr. Electric and save the world."
Araki's latest is surprisingly mellow in its examination of ganja-fueled apathy.
The soundtrack rounds up the accumulation of clichés that characterizes the entire film. [Full review in Spanish]
"Even as it probes the difficulties of coping with loss and showcases Cheadle's remarkable capacity for compelling understatement, the movie also grants Sandler too much time to perform his seriosity in close-up."
Apparently those roads are littered with clichs and contrivances.
"A disaster, a dour When Harry Meets Sally."
"There is very little dread or apprehension, and though I like the creepy ideas, they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill."
Movies like Tomb Raider are designed only to part fools from their money.
"The movie's one long act of misdirection - a story that purports to have a USP, and high stakes, but has neither. It turns out the audience were the marks all along."
The film ends up being an overly emotional film which focuses an astonishing amount of time on watching Christine cry.
The term is Oscar-bait.
"Its central relationship has a sitcom-ish superficiality, heavy on light banter and lacking in any real passion."
A production like this deserves better scriptwriters and a better leading player.
"A collection of murdery bits that Argento wants us to stare at until we feel uncomfortable, strung together in a perfunctory, boring plot as the harpsichords-harpsichords-everywhere-harpsichords score chimes away. "
[T]he movie too often feels as if it's pulling its punches on targets demanding to be hit.
This case study may be best returned to the file cabinet.
"This was made for those of you looking for a fun time at the theater, with a little action and belly laughs mixed in."
"""Twister"" is so depressingly infantile that after a bit you need to take shelter not from the winds but from all the twaddle flying through the air."
Critics galore are fawning over Anderson's move to animation. Why all the fuss? - the man's been staging puppet shows for years.
"The title stands alone as a noun, but it could be deployed as an adjective, before 'waste of money', 'waste of time', or 'waste of talent'."
"""Non-stop"" would appear to refer to the missed opportunities in this pale precursor to Tom Tykwer's ""Run Lola Run."""
"Spooks addicts will probably be satisfied, but those used to the ambition and mega-budgets of Bourne and Bond may feel shortchanged."
Makes Demi Moore's later crappy movies look like Casablanca.
The spotlight on the text poses a problem ... in that only a few of the actors are a match for the language.
"Director Eli Horowitz’s zany, unsubtle look at generational divides, damaging selfishness, and a world of lies is intriguing, creepy, and unintentionally funny. "
"...Adolescent heaven personified with endless, wallopin' fights between WWF-looking steroidians, highlighting a mindless production akin to a widescreen video game. In the oft pounded word of The Hulk himself, 'Grrrrr!'"
The latest Adam Sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year.
"Passable, but rather disappointing."
"It's a movie that seems to have a mild form of heatstroke: it's blurry, as if filmed long ago, and feverish, and the story wanders all over the place as if lost in a bayou. When it's over, you want to wipe your brow."
"There's no swifter way to ruin 'not bad' than a reminder of something truly great... and for I, Robot, that reminder is never further away than the title."
"Inflated to feature length and devoid of nuance or fresh insights, it just seems self-congratulatory - aren't we great for having done this for these old guys? - and exploitive."
"A lot of blood, sweat and tears was obviously poured into ""Southpaw."" But very little sense."
The latest big screen incarnation of the popular Marvel Comics series is an overly violent snoozefest that lacks any humor or any other redeemable quality.
"Those expecting the brand of hefty satire found in And's last film, Long Live Liberty, will have to wait."
Has the distinct whiff of a quick cash-grab sequel even though it's been in production for more than four years.
"Visceral, unrelenting, affecting and, as often, exasperating."
Unwinds at a languid pace that is positively soporific&#46; Void of tension or excitement&#44; Blueback lacks any sense of adventure&#46;&#46;&#46;It&#8217;s a full 70 mins before a few plot elements begin to coalesce&#44; yet they don&#8217;t add up to anything that creates any real drama&#46;
Vid-game action scenes coupled with dime-store philosophy do not make for compelling cinema.
Not even [Jolie's] hair is believable.
For all the complicated CG wizardry and ostensibly visionary gloss...[Gravity] is aesthetically and structurally regressive.
"Derivative, rote, devoid of heart and hope. Guy Ritchie has found no reason to retell Arthur's story, or to render a mythic hero as a self-serving thug."
"Towne's script somehow can never put us in his hero's mind, his actions are always incomprehensible and we never get close enough to the man to give a hoot what happens to him."
"Just from eyeing the Mr. Woodcock movie poster, you could suspect exactly what the movie will be. Just 90 minutes later, your suspicions would be confirmed."
Seyfried does yeoman's work here -- but she has been in her share of clunkers and deserves better material.
Noticeably lacking the punch that its predecessors contained.
It is a tournament of brutality unrelieved by imagination.
"A spectacularly silly video-game adaptation about a Fresh Prince of Gel Hair who runs around the desert with a magic dagger, a curious version of Alfred Molina and some hoity-toity chick who never breaks a sweat. It's sort of pointless."
Blackhat proves you CAN polish a turd
"While The Avengers television series was cheeky, stylish and sexy, its big-screen descendant is listless, plodding and as steamy as a brother-sister prom date."
"There's nothing special about this action flick, except how subpar it all seems and how tired it looks."
Why do Hollywood filmmakers keep messing around with and screwing up past successes?
"Kassovitz creates a grungy dystopia, but the action has the crazed, over-edited ruckus of a death-metal video and the top ""international"" cast is notable only for being miscast."
I went in with the best intentions. I wanted to succumb to Bieber Fever and the movie never got me there.
The writer gets as tangled in his own explanations as a puppy in a 30-foot leash.
"There's a charming restaurant scene, some nifty hand-to-hand combat and the cast is great looking. But pretty much all the things that made the original so original are filtered out of this un-original."
"“Alice,” the movie, dares to go through the looking glass, but it doesn’t entirely know what to do once it gets there."
"If Snow Day has a niche, it isn't quality; it's marketing."
ennui with a dash of nostalgia
"Badly scripted, strangely acted and poorly pitched, there is so much to pick over it's hard to know where to begin. Sometimes the best of bold intentions are just not enough."
"At best, a schlock sci-fi movie that has the quality of a straight-to-video sequel. And at worst, it should have us worried about the direction of the Cloverfield franchise as a whole."
"Despite a litany of co-branded products, the good folks at 20th Century Fox overlooked the two most important ones: a blindfold and a set of earplugs."
"A triumph of design over story, style over substance - a great-looking movie with a plot you can't care much about."
[Its] splendid visuals are dragged down by a tedious story.
"If you've never had the urge to kick Santa Claus, this might be just the irksome misadventure into comedy that will drive you over the edge."
"Slick, but too shallow, uneven and implausible."
Seems destined to swirl down the drain along with other Mouse House flameouts
A strange misfire with conflicted intent.
"The Secret Life of Pets 2 is far from a bad movie, but it offers no real imagination in the storytelling department."
"After that kick-ass opening, the picture devolves into an action-action-plot-action-plot-action monotone. Where have all the gags gone?"
"While there are exciting moments to be had, the underwritten human characters and murky fight scenes add up to an underwhelming experience."
Its throwback elements offer more in the way of irritating limitations than timelessness.
"The choppy, sloppy film too often asks its inherently feminist premise to prop up everything that transpires in place of legitimate character work. Of the many reasons it shouldn't miss, not even pulling the trigger is the most disappointing."
Often entertaining in ways it doesn't mean to be.
"The baseball sequences are fabulous, not least because Costner looks and moves like a real player a rarity for actors in sports movies... But the love story, a five-year off-and-on affair, is little more than a sop to Costner's romantic faithful."
A provocative idea executed with a halfhearted commitment.
The slow-motion footage of these athletes showing off their macho skills is generously underpinned by rumbling hip-hop. Great nightclub wallpaper.
Take your date to this laugh-less stinker and it may be your last.
"The scientific theorizing ultimately feels like a big distraction, keeping us off-guard from a mystery that isn't that involving on its own."
"A Gentle Creature is too overblown with its anti-Russia stance, consistently missing the intended target of the country's suffocating bureaucracy in order to portray ordinary Russians as being as corrupt as those in charge."
"There's an argument in the film about what is interesting and what is important, and how the two should be weighed. In that spirit, ""The Front Runner"" is interesting, but it's not weighty or assured enough to be important."
Rifkin's Festival continues Woody Allen's recent string of minor work.
"In ""Suburbicon,"" none of it comes together and, in the end, it feels like Clooney is doing his best Coen Brothers impression instead of making this movie his own."
"It's beautifully shot and acted, but as with Coco Before Chanel last year, the one thing audiences will most want to know goes unanswered again: What makes this remarkable woman tick?"
A redundant spy farce sequel that's less of a rebirth than a retread.
"The movie's emphasis on brawn over brain might not be so off-putting if the action sequences provided Iron Man-level whiz bang wow, but all of the big set-pieces are marred by confusing choreography and low-grade digital effects."
"This is the third feature within a year (on top of two TV shows) to come out of Perry's fast food, drive-thru productions. So it's not surprising that the Single Moms Club feels like it was slapped together by someone who is ready to take the next order."
"It shows in a one-joke situation that rapidly wears thin, in tension that doesn't hold up, in acting that is never up to snuff."
[Hardwicke] falls short in the hardest part of her job - pruning back Peralta's unwieldy script to get to the heart of these boys' unique bond as friends and competitors.
Where did you say the exit was?
Post-viewing showers should be mandatory.
"The Longest Yard is an average, enjoyable, undemanding movie, but another in a long line of unwarranted and unnecessary remakes."
A more fitting tribute to William Castle would have been to create a horror flick you could sit through without consistently squirming in abject loathing.
"Just like Sweden's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, the makers of this film seem to confuse high art and police procedural."
"Except for the ingratiating performances of Hurt and Weaver, this thriller-cum-mystery-cum-romance-cum-comedy is a victim of cinematic schizophrenia."
It's honestly a miracle anyone was ever willing to see a Batman movie again after this film.
Perhaps viewers of a certain age will get a charge out of this clash of magic and low self-esteem&#44; but it&#8217;s doubtful others will&#44; especially when this same type of story has been done to death&#44; and in much better movies&#46;
"A tame, inoffensive little comedy that's never heinous enough to stink up the theater completely, even though it rarely rises above mediocrity."
A cerebral comedy that's too anxious to demonstrate how clever and erudite it is to bother creating...a narrative that's more than an affected faux-philosophical puzzle.
"Any way you slice it, you have seen the premise of The Commuter before -- maybe a little different, maybe a lot the same -- but the point is you've seen it."
"The final result is passable enough to justify a rental for action lovers, but for everyone else Brick Mansions deserves a pass."
"Despite good performances and a warm ambience, this squishy story needed more time in the oven."
Nothing Makes Sense
It's not a cohesive show
"...a one-note character study about an unhappy, insecure, delusional paranoiac, whose assassin gimmick wears thin almost before it gets started."
Nothing much happens. A cat makes a move and purrs. Someone is reprimanded for not tucking in his shirt.
"There's a lot going on here, but not much of it is very interesting."
"Saddled with a wandering opening and an equally listless conclusion, a more fitting name for this two hour-plus biopic might well be Before Night Falters."
"But amid the luxury of Abu Dhabi, the New Yorkers soon butt up against tradition, and their outrageous antics are no longer funny and harmless but offensive and dangerous."
"Unfortunately, the film's jaunty, comedic tone too often backfires, not helped by Sudeikis, who doesn't seem sure whether he is playing for laughs or not."
Too obvious and predictable and like so many other movies ... it was hard to get very excited about it.
"Though it has artistry in spades, and Enyedi's talent cannot be doubted, On Body and Soul does not do justice to the people it wishes to represent."
They turn a potentially complex family journey into silly farce and still expect you to care.
Murphy is so oddly bland in Daddy Day Care that it seems like he sleepwalked through the making of the film.
"Hit the Rodin, Jacques."
"Washington gives us another astounding performance of a deeply idiosyncratic man, but the film around him often isn't as skillful, meandering in places and gradually becoming more like a lot of other films."
"It's not a bad movie, but it's been undone by incredibly stupid marketing."
"If it weren't such a crippling clich it might be moving, but it is insanely trite and not poignant at all; worse, it's unintentionally funny."
"There's something wrong with the cast of Jackass, and the simple fact of the matter is that watching people satisfy their masochistic tendencies isn't fun or funny."
"There's so much ambitious spectacle, but it's surrounded by so many lazy contrivances that one would want to gasp in astonishment if one weren't chuckling and groaning in aggravation so often."
I think I chucked twice&#44; once when Mark Strong lets fly a &quot;Huzzah&#33;&quot; 
"Viewers hungry for a catch-all dose of Welshian sardonicism would be better served checking out Trainspotting. Better soundtrack, for one."
The Virginity Hit confuses humiliation with comedy.
"There must be some reason to worry over the fate of these people, but it's not in the movie."
"Overacted, underwritten, and with flashback cues so lazy the characters may as well just say, ""I remember when...,"" the film feels like The Notebook II."
"It engages in random, albeit funny asides rooted in its foul-mouthed characters, bloody hockey violence, and intentional stupidity. For many, that will be enough to justify this sequel to the 2012 cult favorite, Goon."
Confetti doesn't step too far off the beaten path of such concerned-parent dramas.
Bait 3D needs to put aside the forced poignancy and attain full great bad movie status. Or at least let the sharks eat more characters.
"The Creature is on target, but the rest of the film is so frantic, so manic, it doesn't pause to be sure its effects are registered."
"So generally downbeat that it's difficult to stay awake, let alone laugh, cry, or cheer."
"Like so many biopics that have come before, The United States vs Billie Holiday can't quite crack how to tell Holiday's story effectively."
A mostly bush-league effort from Blumhouse keeps the long-held tradition of treating Stephen King properties like one of those junky paperbacks you buy in desperation before boarding a four-hour flight to somewhere you don't care about.
"Yep, it's another ""Alien"" clone. A few good gruesome moments, but that's about all."
"For all its genuine thrill-ride gestalt, No Escape completely short-shrifts its Southeast Asian players."
"You have to admire Ruiz's audacity in attempting such an expansive production in these strained times, and his sheer love of storytelling comes shining through -- even if the film's duration has the ability to push your patience to its limit."
"Between rivalry reunions, cringe attempts at social commentary, questionable usage of survivors guilt, and an emphasis on blood over scares, theres also reason to believe this project should have been chainsawed to shreds from its inception"
"Morphing as often as the character central to its story, Splice is an unruly mix of science, morality, family dysfunction, horror and finger-down-the-throat gross-out ridiculousness."
"Bland jokey rehash disappoints. Laurie Strode could have been heroine to every woman terrorized by crazed, violent ex, but no..."
A cringeworthy&#44; dull and painfully unfunny misfire that fails as a comedy&#44; satire&#44; romance and character study&#46;
"Koepp doesn't trust the basics of the hunt, bending over backwards to paste a soul on a simplistic machine of suspense."
"Over on the aliens side, it's hard to make out faces, but there's no doubt about their place of origin: These slimy, growling, bug-eyed and distinctly non-scary things are straight from central casting."
"Rich in authentic period atmosphere and performances, but sabotages its best efforts with a sentimental payoff."
"As a whole, the movie struggles to establish its footing, leaving audiences unhappy with the final product. The potential is clear, but The Runners fails to deliver."
A terrific-looking movie photographed with intelligence and written in crayon.
[A] fact-based but ungainly moralistic spy saga.
Emancipation is a worthy endeavour but the delivery is an exhausting effort&#46;
"Being startled is not the same as being scared, and speaking on behalf of other hardened critics, I have to say we weren't scared for a moment."
"You don't have to love Federico Fellini to hate ""Nine."" But it helps."
There's never really a moment in There's Someone Inside Your House that suggests its protagonists are real enough to be worth rooting for.
"As it is, Trippin' is serviceable as an undemanding date movie."
Eventually it mutates into a paranoid revenge plot that might be called Walking Short.
This movie is the equivalent of skimming Wikipedia for the key points to put in the book report.
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is a disappointment whose title may unwittingly end up serving as the epitaph for a briefly promising franchise.
"Given that most Americans know the network only by reputation, or via Donald Rumsfeld's public denunciations of it, a little more objective information would not have gone amiss."
"This has lots of TV sitcom stars working very hard to be funny with ludicrous characters. If an actor looks like he's laboring to be funny, he isn't."
"It is like watching a group of decent, polite people trying to cope with the arrival of a certifiable lunatic to their hitherto civilised party."
"This is a disappointing turn coming from Phillips, particularly since ""The Hangover"" was such a fresh, bracing brew of black comic fun."
"If I were Holden Caulfield, I might call it lousy."
Quirky but unsatisfying.
Never feels like anything but a movie with its characters who constantly say what they're feeling and doing and it never once feels genuine or organic.
"Despite flashes of bawdy humor, Can't Hardly Wait is just like its beer: it starts out frothy but soon goes flat."
"A mildly engaging, low-key drama that's somewhat lazy, bland and ultimately underwhelming."
A bad film that announces the coming of even more bad films. [Full review in Spanish]
"All of the leads here -- especially Hoffman, big surprise there -- are top notch and thoroughly believable in their roles. Unfortunately, it seems no one thought out just what their roles should be."
"Val Kilmer gives the performance of his career as Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone's biopic, so it's a shame the surrounding film lets him down."
To Olivia is cushioned by its own carefully managed good taste.
No one needs a telephoto lens to see what's coming in Shutter.
Charming but insignificant.
"Over-the-top, but also earnest in a berserk way. It's too flat and perfunctory, and it should've been much better than it was."
"Despite all of the head-slapping - figuratively and literally - from the script, Fist Fight is a light movie with only one lesson plan in mind: to entertain."
...a bit like ordering egg rolls at McDonald's.
"For all the care and attention given to Lila and the support group, the script is filled with one-dimensional characters. Davis can make it work, but other actors are stuck with stock archetypes."
Fallen is about listlessness in the face of personal and global turmoil and about gesturing toward a political stance.
"Had the film taken more of an edgy and irreverent approach - along the lines of one character's titular response, Breathe, Bitch to Waiting to Exhale -- it may have been more interesting and far more amusing and perhaps even insightful."
So much care has been contributed to the soundtrack that director Frears has forgotten about the importance of the film itself.
"A big, lumbering, unwieldy epic that creaks and groans from speech to battle."
Experimental-cinema fans weaned on formal deconstruction and celluloid chaos will likely find their minds less than blown.
"To my mind, movies about watching nomads walk rank alongside movies about writers writing: The action is dull and endlessly repetitive, and most of the interesting stuff occurs in the mind's interior."
A Dickensian story recast for the age of Oprah...well-meaning but episodic and ultimately pat.
Some keen performances from Julianne Moore and Finn Wolfhard&#44; but fails to find the emotional meat in the fraught relationship between mother and teen son&#46;
"In an increasingly competitive genre, a really bad guy at the center of your scam documentary isn't enough to make it stand out."
"By the end, Cheap Thrills too closely resembles the behavior it depicts."
"Like someone mashed Pacific Rim with Leaving Las Vegas, Vigalondo's screenplay is rarely clever."
"There are laughs, to be sure, and some gleeful supporting performances, but after a promising start the movie sinks in a bog of sentiment."
"After three disturbingly violent films, this may be a concept that deserves to be purged."
Succumbs to being like a feature-length film adaptation of the SNL skit The Needlers only with a more dour atmosphere.
A hackneyed backstage soap opera...with all the subtlety of the lyrics of the country-western songs that fill the soundtrack.
"Despite its best intentions, Father Hood is destined to become leftovers in the video store."
"Everyone is a maximal design statement plugged into volatile action and pretty scenery, but it might be the deluxe origami folding of a silk diaper, its myth-telling so primal as to seem childish."
Movie packaging at its worst.
"Basically, the film does 'the job,' but not much more than that."
"consistently goes for the cheap laughs, mining way too many jokes out of puns, pratfalls, and the occasional reference to poop (these are apes, after all)"
An overlong&#44; pretentious and emotionally vacant journey through one screwed-up family&apos;s &apos;80s dystopia&#46; The sort of film directors like to make&#44; actors like to be in and audiences have to endure&#46;
COCAINE BEAR caused me to feel fatigued&#44; and much like how I used to feel after a hangover&#59; angered that I did this to myself&#46;
"It's not the first horror movie to end up making no sense, but it may be the first that actually appears proud of the accomplishment."
"A tedious slog that appears to have been made for the express purpose of annoying the audience. It succeeds at that, so I guess I have to give it a good review."
"To put it mildly, neither of the leads has the physique for such a Darwinian showdown, and one of the frustrations of Killing Season is the way Evan Daugherty's screenplay demands near-invincibility."
I would prefer seeing a failed attempt at something different than a regurgitation of every modern horror trope. Yet The Witch proves unable to capitalize on being different.
"Unfortunately, the film begins to lose its once-solid footing in the third act, leading to a rushed and disappointing ending."
"Burns has clearly thought long and hard about how to open our eyes, but maybe not enough about how to keep them that way."
"Deeper questions about Albert's style and artistic identity are left underexplored, strange considering the film's abrupt title. Maybe there are just too many personalities in disorder for one feature film to handle."
All compelling material soon dissipates into a plodding assemblage of static frames within which very little happens...
"Might be the worst feature-length film ever made about the ""consulting detective"" from Baker Street."
"There's nothing to sink our teeth into, especially when we already know how it ends. There's no suspense."
"Darting between Earth and the rest of the cosmos, Green Lantern can be fun as spectacle (which is why kids may go for it), yet the whole movie is eye candy, and not much more."
"Battle, romance, mysticism; it sounds great. It isn't."
"...yet another movie here that comes nicely packaged, but without much substance inside..."
"A tour de force of subtlety and restraint, 45 Years is the perfect movie to see alone if you've just broken up with someone and want confirmation it was a good idea."
"Audiences new to this world will likely find themselves confused, with too many different elements stuffed into one movie."
"Another day at the office for director Roland Emmerich, who has previously attacked American cities in Independence Day and Godzilla."
Overbaked and underwhelming.
"Schwarzenegger still looks spectacular, but the script is short on deadpan zingers, and his heart doesn't seem in it."
"The two leads try hard to behave like a very much in love couple but are somehow unconvincing in their portrayal. It doesn't come out as natural, the effort is showing."
"...the movie, which admittedly does start out with some promise, ultimately becomes just as aimless and tedious as such recent Allen failures as Whatever Works and You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger."
"Vice delivers some impressive performances, but as a narrative, there's room for improvement."
"The Hunger Games movies have hit that emotional note, pitting Peeta against Gale, distracting Katniss with young-adultish emotional havoc. Whether it distracts you is the question."
Casting two lookalikes and coaching your young actors to mimic the trio from 'Twilight' isn't enough to make for a great parody.
"A disjointed retread of the The Ring co-written by the mastermind behind Batman & Robin, this half-sequel/half-remake is all kinds of stupid and boring. The cleverest thing it does is name its tiny-nippled, brotastic, generic white male lead ""Holt."""
Dumb and Dumberer's worst offence is that it constantly reminds you how much funnier the original was; it's like watching a stoner re-enacting Monty Python and getting the jokes totally wrong.
"Transgender jokes, fat jokes (always James, happy to look stupid), homeliness jokes, mama's boy jokes -- the picture was made by people who like to put down people, and it was made for people who like to tease others or watch others be insulted."
Constantine seems to share more of the right wing's agenda than just an apocalyptic point of view.
"It's not about a horse, it's jockey, or it's trainer. It's about a horse owner. Instead of honoring the greatest race horse ever, they try to find an underdog story with Diane Lane's help."
Only auditions ideas (including militant feminism) and its art touches are a pottage of old horror tricks.
"It's the bulk of the story that ultimately confuses LaGravenese, who's unable to isolate ideal dramatic highs and lows, catching the adaptation blues as he strives to please fans and welcome newcomers."
"At the ends, I fully threw my hands up. It makes no sense..."
"It pains me to say this, but I'd almost prefer the mindlessness of ""Taken"" over the social preaching of ""Siddharth."""
There's ultimately not a whole lot within One Good Cop for the viewer to enthusiastically embrace...
"It makes it more difficult to just let something like La La Land just passively wash over you when, however well-intentioned, the film hearkens back to a time when black humanity onscreen was deliberately hamstrung."
"Julianne Moore can be many, many wonderful things -- beautiful, talented, redheaded, heartbreaking -- but funny doesn't seem to be one of them."
"If you're looking for mindless action and ridiculously cheesy storylines that you can laugh at, then The Great Wall will fill that void."
"Gone is the surprise, the laughter of disbelief that made Scary Movie such a vacation from civility."
"An over-energetic, giddily lively rehash of a past hit."
Screwed may be based on the true-life experiences of former prison guard Ronnie Thompson but it seems to serve up every available clich from the handbook of tough nut British prison dramas.
"The hybrid of live action and animation is quite handsomely rendered and amusing, as it happens. But its creators overindulge, to the point of crassness, in cliches drawn from action movies and pop culture."
"Nazis were once innocent children -- that, at least, is the notion behind Dennis Gansel's overcooked wartime drama about the ill-fated friendship between two teenage boys at a training school for elite German military recruits."
"The story girding Do-Deca - though intriguing - doesn't feel as well-developed as previous Duplass scripts. As a result, it never quite resonates, style be darned."
"Despite the absence of karaoke cowboys in American Outlaws, there are enough anachronisms of other varieties to make it an unintentionally screwy experience."
"An all-female studio made X. However, don't expect any feminist insights: the villainess still has huge jugs . . ."
"Somewhere along the way, Abrams begins delivering everything we expect, as opposed to those nebulous wonders we didn't know we wanted."
It betrays its own motivation of being purely for kids with its failed endeavors to bridge its grating humor to thinking adults.
"The movie's notion of fun comes to involve an unclean rest stop, slipped pills and an eminently foreseeable conclusion."
"With its multicultural casting and ""uplifting"" message about how the people that support you in your life are your real family, Ice Age 4 is ""progressive"" and positive while somehow being completely forgettable."
"Instead of trying to provide insight into this genius's debilitating madness, Davis prefers to wallow in incoherent and clichd misery, punctuated by poetically oblique imagery."
"It's all very showy, beautifully shot, and ultimately irritating and headache inducing, largely because the script makes even the emotions and grievances that get vented unconvincing despite the strong performance."
"Excluding moments of chilling effectiveness, this could fairly be called his worst film. Even his saving grace of keen directorial acumen visibly loses cohesion on screen."
Neither viscerally compelling nor emotionally satisfying.
"The Four Feathers aspires to be a sweeping epic, but it plays more like a very special Dawson's Creek."
Questionable ideals and Katrina Kaif make Phantom less than memorable.
"The main issue I had with the film was the climax which I felt just came to a head point at a very weird time, and I just wasn't really sure about the whole formula of the film."
"If you're prepared to sit through two and a half hours of noisy cack to see a grand total of three decent special effects sequences, then I can heartily recommend it."
The film is a smug and contemptuous mess from beginning to end that is likely to bore little kids and aggravate any adult still holding fond memories of the character from their own childhoods.
"Flat, boring, pointless, and nonsensical."
You will be hard pressed to find a movie this year as overly directed as this one.
Woe is the Marchetta sisters!
"Boiled down to its essentials, F&F is four pretty swell auto-race video games encased in the bloated carcass of a script, by Chris Morgan, that must have been researched in the Archive of Movie Cliches."
Prey At Night delivers the same intentionally pointless terror as its predecessor - but it takes more delight in it (and thus doesn't sell it quite as well).
"Director John Ridley is obsessed with this juvenile idea of love; something that you would find in computer-generated web pages on the internet, and does nothing else to make his characters even remotely interesting."
"Midthunder is a compelling lead, but you don’t need Predator vision to see how warmed-over this franchise has become."
"Has a bigger budget and bigger stars, but it's not nearly as funny."
I like my sleaze 100% pure; this movie is covered in Sleaze-Whiz.
"If you remember the Fantasy Island television show, you should watch the film at least once if for nothing more than nostalgia's sake."
An unqualified disaster in the purest sense.
"For all the fast cuts, the furious vibes, the faux sexiness, Torque is canned and mighty flat."
"Frozen II often doesn't feel like a movie as much as a chess match, with the characters being shoved all around the board with studied precision."
"The film is always a little bit at a distance, almost involving, always good enough to make us root for it, but rarely better than average."
"works well enough, until we come to the last 20 or so minutes of the thing"
"Could have been better, had Leclercq resisted to urge to include the soap operatics ... It's solid - but it should have been gripping."
"Artemis Fowl is a bumpy, rudderless ride despite the fact that its runtime is only 95 minutes."
"Breaking Dawn - Part 1 as a whole feels stretched-out, as if the filmmakers realized belatedly that there wasn't enough material in the book to sustain two movies. (There isn't)."
You just have to wonder if a female writer or director could have had more vision in shaping this fertile material into something worthwhile.
"[E]liminates everything that was intriguing from the first movie ... and offers a quest that feels cobbled together from other, better material."
Maybe I'm wrong about the dreary screenplay with its undeveloped characterizations; the mixed acting chops; the poorly choreographed battle scenes that make you make you appreciate Game of Thrones all the more; plus the uninspired direction. . . .
"A comedy about the migrant crisis is more daring than a coming-of-age story, and Limbo, wanting it both ways, dilutes its best instincts with sops to formula."
"Makes you question what's real and not, but doesn't follow through. Two thirds of a absolutely brilliant film that in the end made me want to throw a brick through the screen. Goes completely off the rails."
To say [Hartnett] lacks charisma or screen presence is like saying Hurricane Katrina caused a few problems.
"Angry, fatally biased but watchable documentary ranting at China for its transgressions and damage done to the U.S. economy cries out for second opinions from other corners besides those damning."
"Imaginative to a fault, whimsical until you say uncle, ""Mood Indigo"" pushes director Michel Gondry's style of surreal playfulness to its breaking point."
The cinematic equivalent to a professor giving a creative art student a history assignment when you know good and well that he's better off doing art.
It's not too fast and not too slow. It's not too racy and it's not too offensive. It's not too much of anything.
Chris Hemsworth walks off with the 3-hour cameo extravaganza. The talking rodent comes in second. Doesn't anybody deserve to die?
Two Weeks Notice will find its audience of middle-class women infatuated with the Pretty Woman fantasy of Richie Rich finding the needle of gold in the dishevelled haystack.
"Elizabeth Olsen quakes and trembles, but fails to blow this house down"
A group of people who should know better find themselves eager for the cold embrace of death. But enough about the poor souls who bought tickets to Flatliners.
It's the socio-cultural suggestions of this storytelling choice that's ultimately most troublesome.
"Wolfgang Becker's social satire has a knobby tone that somewhat mutes its crowd-pleasing ambitions and keeps it from becoming My Big, Fat Life Is Beautiful."
Fairly worthless from start to finish...
"This handsomely mounted and dully executed film boasts no shortage of Oscar favorites in the cast. It's as pretty as a flower, but it needs some air to bloom."
"It is time for Mills to finally settle into a quiet retirement while Neeson moves on to better, heretofore untaken (in every sense) action showcases."
"I could not wait for this movie to end, but then I am not a fan of this sort of movie anyway. It is a particularly bad viewing choice on a cold, snowy winter's night when I am feeling isolated by a deadly pandemic."
There's little to recommend here beyond Snipes always being an enjoyable watch and the accidental casting coup of future Game Of Thrones stars in supporting rolls.
"The drama is drab, the romance is heat-free, and too often I saw Woodley and others running and chasing and fighting, only to stop and say dialogue that made me think these actors would poke fun if they were sitting in the audience."
Its denunciation of rich-nation profiteering at the expense of poor-nation exploitation has you ready to pull your 'enough already' ripcord.
"Falha ao jamais encontrar um tom adequado para sua narrativa: em certos momentos,  excessivamente infantil; em outros, sombrio demais."
"Despite the film's distinctive look and the best efforts of the willing cast, this amusing, morbid and mildly misanthropic mlange always seems to be straining for effect."
"Cliched, bombastic, coincidental, corny and technologically implausible, ""2012"" is so silly it might be entertaining if it didn't go on so long."
"A very ordinary film, particularly for one adapted from such a thoughtful and tonally tricky book."
The Black Phone has some solid set pieces and decent performances from the child leads&#44; but it never quite musters enough substance to horrify in the way that it should&#46;
"These fights, splayed across ravished urban landscapes, aren't especially distinguished, but they're really all this Michael Dougherty-directed movie has to offer."
"Dead Men Tell No Tales doesn't reinvent the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, and plays it safe instead."
"The production seems genuinely fearful of turning this effort into anything more than a dewy tale of deliverance, with a side portion of hunks."
"The stars remain a boring threesome, Stewart limping through supposedly impassioned speeches as though Bella already were one of the cold-blooded undead."
"If you removed the endless soulful gazes, this whole series could've been delivered as a two-night SyFy Channel exclusive and wrapped up before the next airing of Sharktopus."
"If the movie is a mess, it's a purposeful mess, cannily, if not artfully, pushing all the right buttons to ensure Perry will be back for another round."
The Son of No One makes me feel like a teacher whose student has very obviously plagiarized their final paper of the semester.
"The chief problem is this film is too much in love with itself, too much in awe at what they can get away with."
"Curiously old-fashioned, with Germans, Israelis, Palestinians and French speaking accented English. Particularly caricaturistic are Marson's Shimon Perez, all caterpillar eyebrows and sneers, and Pike, a pill-popping revolutionary with a faraway stare."
"The Return is a slow burn that's often way too slow, feeling stretched to meet a running time that's still under 90 minutes."
...an often interminable experience.
"Though provocative enough to start some film-fest conversations, it's unconvincing on too many fronts to go far."
"The film is far too long, and between the tracks, the episodic adventures of a group of disc jockeys broadcasting rock 'n' roll from a rusty old clunker anchored just beyond the three-mile limit from the British Isles is heavy going."
undiluted garbage
Embodies the tiresome side of independent filmmaking.
"If you're looking forward to the next inquisitorial, curious Soderbergh joint, once you get past the ""Cool! He can shoot on an iPhone!"" thing, there's not a lot to grab on to."
"This is, for worse and only worse, the slipperiest slog of a crime thriller you'll attempt to grasp in 2017 - and that's only one out of infinity problems."
"It has comedic moments to it, but it doesn't really commit to that angle...there are also a lot of scenes in this movie where the light is bleeding over and washing out."
The film's twist ending exists only to retroactively justify writer-director Steven Knight's feeble stylistic choices.
"There are some ropey moments that stick out like a sore thumb, and the stabs at emotion are utterly useless."
The swerve in tone undermines the film's aspirations for moral complexity.
"With an exclamation point suggesting the collegial equivalent of Beatlemania, Zizek! is a movie made by a groupie too enamored of her subject to make a satisfying film about him."
... starts off intriguingly but is eventually scuttled on the shoals of plot contrivance.
"Elephant is neither exploitive nor informative, although it's certainly a crock."
"Unfortunately, most of the film is given over to musicians, baked and bickering endlessly in recording studios."
The movie has 'straight-to-video' written all over it.
"Even before it hurtles off the rails, the plot has enough holes to fill the Albert Hall."
&#46;&#46;&#46;a forgettable and completely disposable piece of work that could and should have been so much better&#46;
Talented actors can't save this frustrating script and lack of actual horror. Needed a bit more to make it impactful
"Long story short: Although I didn't care for Eagle vs. Shark, I'd be eager to see whatever [director] Cohen makes next."
"It's nothing more than a hot fudge sundae -- warm, syrupy and quickly dissipating into a mess."
"Everything is very stylish and mildly funny, but also very light and with a short-lived fascination. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Someday, Amanda Peet will find a great role in a great film."
This campy&#44; bloody&#44; macho fight picture set in Northern Mexico is sure to find a niche audience&#46; As Good as Dead is exactly the B-movie it aims to be&#44; and its cast fits the bill perfectly&#44; including a supporting performance from veteran Tom Berenger&#46; 
Like watching your whole life crawl towards you on its hands and knees.
"Scary, gory, nightmare-inducing slasher."
"Pretentious, self-serving vehicle glorifying Marling. If you can't get hired, write yourself a role where you are worshipped. Make sure you are the only good looking woman in the film with plenty of golden close-ups."
"The first half hour of Captain Marvel feels disjointed and poorly developed in part because you're dumped into an alien culture you know nothing about, which you see from the perspective of a woman who has no memories and doesn't know who she is."
Bush weepie takes all sides and none.
Mostly funny but ultimately forgettable.
"Vlad's a super-monster. The plot gets jittery. Vlad's relationship with his sweet, fair, lovely wife remains sweetly, fairly, lovingly vapid. And into the 15th-century setting is tossed the modern trope of the father who'll do anything for his family."
"If you think Britney and Michael were careless with their babies, you haven't seen anything yet."
"The film is a composite of so many genres, techniques, and age-old conceits that it can't help but miss each and every one by a mile."
The biggest disappointment is the waste of such an excellent cast. This is terminally treacly fare in which the writing is often very trite indeed.
I have a heart. I just don't want schlock.
"The two main women in this film make the Pre-Crime Unit possible, but don't benefit themselves. Guess the future isn't that much different. The guys are still having all the fun, while the girls either make that possible or sit by and watch."
"Heavy on the spice and cheap on the meat, Bangkok Dangerous adds plenty of Thai seasoning to the Hollywood lone-assassin recipe, but the result is only mildly pungent."
"Screenwriter Gina Wendkos, working from Meg Cabot's novel, resorts to monotonous movie clichs: almost uniformly cruel classmates and a callous, cacophonous mob of media jackals."
"Designed as a tribute to the Filipino resistance, it's fast, vigorous and quite exciting, but marred by incessant flag-waving, the usual racist depiction of the enemy, and some atrocious sentimentality."
"Even leading up to the strange twist, Flower doesn't know what to make of itself."
"'Caveat' is a confident debut but won't be everyone's speed, given how unknowns and sluggish pacing become the film's ultimate signatures."
"Writer-director James DeMonaco's The Purge fritters away its promise in lurid, frenzied violence."
It's strange in that the best material seems to have been saved for the supporting cast members.
Fans hoping to watch Schwarzenegger growl his catchphrases with a slight edge of shtick are underestimating the patience involved in sitting through a two-hour slog.
The characters are so badly drawn that we don't empathize with them
"Once the gimmick has worn out its welcome, the movie makes misstep after misstep until a final shootout of baffling stupidity."
As a showcase for the inimitable Dafoe it has its minor freaky-deaky pleasures&#46; Ultimately&#44; though&#44; it goes nowhere&#8212;literally and figuratively&#46;
A stale spook concoction from the William Castle-Robb White production team.
"[A] barely competent domestic thriller, bound to make you groan more than think."
"Ramin Bahrani is a promising filmmaker who needs to work much harder at crafting dialogue and complete stories, and not believe the false praise being bestowed on him by the A.O. Scotts of the world."
I want to see Kutcher play a serial killer without a conscious and with his own hair. Enough rom-coms that take place in another universe!
A milquetoast homunculi assembled by the most hackneyed form of studio groupthink imaginable.
It's too bad it's not a better film.
"Ugly, in every sense of the word."
Evokes more Michael Jackson than magical whimsey. Director Marc Forster knows better than to rely on emotional manipulation like he does here.
"""Motherless Brooklyn"" is the kind of knotty, ambitious, character-rich, politically conscious entertainment the studios so rarely get behind anymore, you can't help wishing it were better."
"It's a confusing mess, but one that holds a strange fascination."
Feels downright static.
"While you might appreciate its goal, the writing and execution aren't strong enough to reach it."
"World-saving, all-powerful, hero-to-everyone stuff must be lonely work, and Singer's Superman bears the responsibility with the slightly clenched dutifulness of someone who's immortal enough to accept his destiny but human enough to suffer the weight."
"Rain Man is a buddy picture with one buddy missing, a road movie without much to see along the way."
"The film is interesting to look at for the ways in which the different stories are edited together, but the technical element isn't enough to keep you fully engaged, and eventually it all becomes a bit dreary."
&#91;Thompson and Hemsworth&#93; clearly enjoy each other and their ability to flawlessly execute jab after jab of dialogue fully realizes the buddy cop dynamic baked into &#91;Men in Black&#58; International&#93;&#46;
... The film runs over its conclusion clinging to a drowning hand -- flashbacks of Sierra and Jake -- to try to put [emotional] weight into an already watered-down story. [Full review in Spanish]
'Allegiant' continues its confusing tale.
"Its stabs at uncanny were mainly retreads, and uncanny cannot, by definition, feel familiar"
Gone is the sense of wonder that began 29 years ago&#44; what&#8217;s left is doldrums &amp; dread of seeing a once-fascinating story become so insipid&#46; At nearly 2&#46;5 hours long&#44; it way overstays its welcome&#46; Actually&#44; it never has much reason to exist to begin with&#46;
It's the sort of film that everyone will end up seeing but no-one really cares when they see it. I could happily have waited for DVD.
Remember how terrific the original Ice Age movie was? That was then. This is now. Alas.
In downplaying Donna&#8217;s own extensive work as an activist and the history she is a part of&#44; Bedwani offers up a lacking portrait of her&#46;
A potentially intriguing examination of family bonds and abusive relationships is relegated to the background in this generic revenge thriller.
"A recycled, unfunny, dumbed-down version of a really good movie - maybe a dose of that nitrous oxide would have helped ."
"The Wedding Singer is two movies for the price of one, and they're both awful."
"Time Code isn't so much a movie as an experiment in digital filmmaking, and one likely to induce nausea or migraines in the viewer."
Really pretty lame.
"Cody has a distinct authorial voice and specific, pop-culture interests - and absolutely no idea what to do with either quality."
"Nothing more than a loud, horrible cinematic experience that will leave horror fans demanding Kahn's head on a pike once the film gets released."
"Stay for the nail-biting conclusion, but only if you can stomach the horror of Queen Latifah and Terrence Howard reaching career lows as manifestations of all that is cheerful and insufferable, respectively, about the holidays."
"Inspired by supernatural thrillers of the '80s, Sadako's trail of amazing ideas never amounts to an enjoyable viewing experience."
"UglyDolls' worst feature is that it's rather bland. For a movie about embracing one's differences, it does seem to be pretty much identical to the many other 'summer holiday kids movies' out there."
"It was so bad, I couldn't wait for it to end."
"Lizzie Borden's 16mm independent production, which took some two years to complete, appears to have all the advantages and the disadvantages of a home movie."
"It thinks its message is feminist, but with its cast of uncommunicative, annoyingly ineffectual, southern-fried biddies, what it really ends up saying is 'Women: Can't live with 'em, can't shoot 'em.'"
"Just when things should be boiling over, the script goes lukewarm."
"Clifford the Big Red Dog is a brown stinker. Maybe not a big brown stinker, but close enough"
The endless gore and violence make the experience torturous -- and not just for the victims in the movie.
"There are some great visuals towards the end as Katie's hallucinations become more prominent, but Dementer is a confusing movie with little solutions to a half baked plot."
It assaults the ears and the intellect.
"The impact of the movie comes in spurts, connected to a few keen insights from this historian or that expert."
"It's camp, trashy and altogether too silly for its own good, only proving that 23-year-old Culkin is far from leaving childish things behind."
"There's a lot of great stuff here, but it just doesn't come together."
"While ""A Dangerous Method"" is handsomely-produced and -designed, what should have been an intriguing story fell pretty flat for me. Cronenberg directs with no particular flair."
"His latest comedy is a mess of tone, themes, shots, and poorly edited jokes that fall flat. In other words, what happens in the bubble should have stayed there."
Scott Derrickson fails to connect the important dots&#8212;or at least answer some vital questions&#8212;that would make this serial killer&#47;ghost story truly haunting&#46;
Gillespie's empathy is mixed with condescension; much of the movie's bluff comedy mocks the tone and the actions of Tonya and her milieu.
"It's a grand shame. Pryor and Wilder vigorously driving in first place, deserved a much better vehicle.  [Full review in Spanish]
"
&quot;For Love of the Game&quot; is painless&#44; but it&apos;s also pompous and pious about baseball in a way that doesn&apos;t mean much to a non-fan like me&#46;
Maybe some classics should just stay classics.
"Diesel is ridiculous here: a puffy, lunk-headed James Bond pushing 50, garbling witless wisecracks through what sounds like a mouthful of Pop Rocks in the rare screen time he can grab from his obvious stunt doubles."
"The movie feels like the direct-to-dvd version of The Mummy, complete with cheesy, already-done CG effects, and best of all, not a single actual mummy in the entire movie."
You can follow every dull detail and predictable plot device without ever glancing up from your cell phone.
"The characters and their banter among each other are enough to pull Rough Night off the ground from a wasted faceplant, but ultimately the story doesn't go dark enough"
&#91;T&#93;he relaxed pacing and lengthy one-takes &#46;&#46;&#46; clash with the obvious desperation of the character&#46;&#46;&#46;
While Carson and Galitzine have good romantic chemistry together&#44; that isn&apos;t enough to make up for a lackluster narrative&#46;
"The Expendables 2 (2012) was somehow a marked improvement, with better action and more downtime between characters ... but it was less of a hit. And now THE EXPENDABLES 3 moves back in the wrong direction again."
"It's a shame that a film so beautiful says so little, even by Nicolas Winding Refn's standards."
The movie features some of the ugliest people and most disgusting behavior this side of I Spit on Your Grave.
There's certainly a lot of material there but none of the comedy works in any way at all and Keaton is a dead zone at the centre of the film.
The film with which we are left is arguably one of the most disappointing horror sequels of all time.
"Every time Murphy and Kutcher lift Married above the youth-comedy cesspit, Sam Harper's script inserts a gratuitous pratfall or gaseous gag, sending the whole thing spiralling downwards."
"Its barely sketched, improvised skits deliver very few laughs."
"How many 14-year-old girls do you know who would set up a blind date with a grown-up over the Internet? (Yeah, I found this creepy too.)"
"O culto a este filme prova que absolutamente qualquer porcaria pode, de uma maneira ou de outra, despertar o interesse de algum."
"While the film goes off in a million different directions, it eventually winds up going nowhere."
Its callous fixation on violence is merely a lame pose meant to distract us from its soggy redemptive core.
"It's a safe bet that if the volume of the laughter in the theater is amplified in direct proportion to how serious any given scene was obviously meant to be, then you've probably got a failure of notable and classic proportions on your hands."
"14 years after it was actually written, The Wedding Ringer finally makes it to screen. Was it worth it? Well, no, but... Had it been released all those years ago the story might be different"
"Although the performances are uniformly on point and the dialogue is tartly British, the film ultimately fails to earn its riotous stripes."
I'm not sure a better cast has ever gone more ickily astray than in this most misbegotten of dramedies.
That's the nicest thing I can say about Wish Upon: It reminds me of one of the most unintentionally hilarious scenes ever filmed.
"I've seen Anaconda, and, senator, Anacondas is no Anaconda."
"Overall, the pacing and characters are where House suffers. The film works as a direct-to-DVD horror movie, but it definitely has its rocky moments."
"If you really want to see it how bad it is, just make sure to pack a bottle of aspirin."
"Maxwell, a TV movie director with no ear for dialogue that isn't over the top and no eye for the sort of visual poetry these stories demand, is plainly not up to the job."
"The kind of movie of which I wish I could say, ""You couldn't pay me to watch that crap."" Obviously, however, you can - but not nearly enough."
"[The] screenplay is ... all over the place, which might be more forgivable if the movie's ultimate destination weren't so dull and slight."
"It's happened to all of us. You get revved to see a big Hollywood comedy, starring an actor so funny he could make you laugh in your sleep, and you're disappointed. Majorly."
I can only recommend you 'be cool' and avoid this vanity project dreck.
"It's a short, sharp shock that never generates enough emotion toward anyone onscreen to make it the thriller it tries mightily to be."
"Apparent kills are left unverified, handy firearms are left untouched, and the group splits up a record four times, ensuring most of these dolts will never see the dawn."
"By the time the credits roll, Men in Black III makes you wish you, too, could travel back in time, skip the movie and see the original for the first time."
"With lazy conventions and convolution, puddle-deep platitudes and cheap nods to nostalgia, this saga concludes on a wildly unsatisfactory note."
"Revenge becomes the dish served cold. In this case, non-entertaining cold."
It doesn&#8217;t help that each actor appears to believe they are in a different movie the one from the other&#44; nor that Amirpour blasts far too many musical cues scene to scene&#44; creating a jarring cacophony of hipster beats&#46;
It's a very tasteful rock and roll movie. You could put it on a coffee table anywhere.
"There is much here to admire, but the overall impression is of a film that does not have the courage of its convictions."
This one is destined to take its place alongside films like Evan Almighty and Wholly Moses!.
It's crass and it's gross. Perhaps director Patrick Brice and screenwriter Sam Bain have a souped-up director's cut where they stashed all the missing jokes.
Precious in its realism this film is so plain is threatens to slip off the screen. Kudos for the honesty but the entertainment is lacking.
The latest movie scraped from the barrel where studio execs store their childhood comic collections.
An odd mix of incompetence and ambition.
"For a movie based on a video game, the story is as far-fetched and the characters as one-dimensional as one might expect."
A Cat in Paris is easy enough on the eyes yet never quite justifies feature-length status.
"This crime caper boasts a celebrity cast that makes for an impressive lobby card, but it turns out that the novelty casting is about all it has going for it."
"While it took three screenwriters to come up with Darkness Falls' countless variations on 'Stay out of the dark!,' many more may have been necessary to provide an interesting plot or developed character."
"Garish and not funny enough, Wilson's shapeless satire plods on, squandering its nice premise and its appealing actors. Miraculously, Fraser has a force field around him and manages to radiate energy in this comic black hole."
"The movie doesn't feel authentic, it's relationships are drawn in erratic, TV movie-like strokes."
"If you're disturbed by white-collar crime, but not quite as disturbed as you are by gay sex, then congratulations: You might possess just the right combo of social conscience and unexamined homophobia needed to fully enjoy Get Hard."
"As in the first Ice Age, the predictable main story and the not-funny-enough script is a waste of some well-executed performances."
"Holding it all together is Diesel, who comes off as a steroid-stoked Buddha; even in the midst of chaos he calmly delivers proverbs in a rumbling basso: ""Everyone's looking for the feel, but what's real is family."" Whatever."
"Juggling mirth, romance and murder requires a deft touch -- think of Hitchcock's Trouble With Harry. Axe is a blunt instrument."
"All it's doing is, more feebly, what Robert Downey Jr. was doing ten years ago."
Offers mostly empty promises.
It's amazing how Phone Booth hits its dramatic peak at the end of the first act and then descends into standard thrillerisms.
"It packs plenty of rabble-rousing ammunition, but its sloppy execution is unlikely to win any merit badges for marksmanship."
A thoroughly mediocre retelling that feels like an unnecessary footnote.
"For all its apparent sombreness and thoughtfulness, The Sea Of Trees is an exasperatingly shallow film on an important and agonisingly painful subject - depression and suicide. This it slathers in palliative sentimentality."
"Director Sisto paints a pretty picture of a hole, and never digs himself out of it."
"A strange concoction of weird stories and styles ... The elements of the plot clash continually, never meshing."
A sick teen who can't leave her house falls in love with the boy-next-door in this bland but efficient adaptation of a young-adult novel.
"I suggest buying a ticket to Prince Caspian, going to grab a bite to eat for the first hour of the film and then heading back to the theatre for the amazing ending battle."
The Family is a comic souffl that never rises.
"Part bloodbath, part sex comedy, totally botched."
Batla House is a needlessly convoluted and garbled interpretation of the 2008 encounter case which entirely sides with the police.
"It's horrible, gut-wrenching carnage to witness, and yet, it's been calibrated to elicit whoops and cheers from fans..."
"Scriptwriter Rob Moreland keeps the one-liners flowing, though, at best, they register no better than a tepid smirk on the humour thermometer."
Although Fat Albert is smart enough to poke fun at itself director Joel Zwick can't quite conjure up any modern relevance.
"There's lots to admire here, in the performances and the visuals, and the way that widescreen makes the vast, cactus-rich landscapes a perfect backdrop for the bizarre mix of genres... But  Bacurau ultimately wasn't to my taste."
"Here, the dizzying pairing of slice-and-splatter violence with the quiet horror of abusive relationships doesn't add up - it's used, unforgivably, as a gimmick."
Painfully humorless.
Only the Apaches really get it - that figures.
"Strictly for 6 year olds, this uninspired, one-joke comedy is full of too many misfired gags and weak comic setups to cross over to anyone whose head reaches above the seat back."
Never crash lands despite appearing constantly on the verge of doing so.
"A big disappointment considering the great director (Ridley Scott), writer (Cormac McCarthy) and cast (Fassbender, Pitt, Diaz, Bardem). Never quite sure where it wants to go."
"Somehow that message never gains the power it should have, and we're left with a film that's easy to respect, but hard to admire. Emotionally, ""Just Mercy"" just sort of lies there. Maybe a chifforobe would've helped after all."
"probably the most detestable production of the decade; or, heck, quite possibly ever!"
"...an immature, if fitfully entertaining work."
"A mixed bag of mediocrity, amounting to nothing more than a composite of superior elements."
"Straying even further from its Beatrix Potter source material, this lackluster sequel amplifies the snark without boosting the charm of the 2018 original."
"Chaves has none of Wan's malevolent mojo, his talent for wringing shivery joy-by-way-of-fear from every spring-loaded appearance by the franchise's growing roster of apparitions."
"While it's got its charms, it's far from likely to bring in any new converts."
"...The Comedian, like Jackie Burke at the center, isn't nearly fresh, interesting, surprising or dynamic enough to work, despite its occasional high points."
...primarily a movie about the disruptive and empowering effects of female nudity -- which is kinda cool. Too bad about the ending.
One to skip unless you really must watch every horror ever made.
"[The] thematic material is so far beyond [director Joe] Roth's reach, you feel that even offering him a stepladder wouldn't help."
"I've little doubt that Swicord and Marshall have produced an accurate account of the geisha lifestyle, but I'm not sure that it feels like a terribly authentic one."
The clever use of historical figures like Howard Hughes and W.C. Fields is really the film's only highlight.
"Since the first film, which came out only last year, exhausted the supply of Scream-I Know What You Did Last Summer-Halloween and Friday the 13th gags, Scary 2 is just leftovers."
...never defines itself to the confused audience.
"It began as a moody, dark thriller and made an abrupt about-face to become a message movie, but at that point there was nothing in its dramatic arsenal."
The proceedings come across as quite a bit less than the greatest story every told.
"Director Justin Kurzel seems to have set out to answer the question, ""What if the supremely ambitious Thane of Glamis (played here by Michael Fassbender) was a druggie?"""
"A Jaeger bomb, but no worse than its humdrum predecessor."
Running Scared is not only toxic but irresponsible in the way it exposes young characters to a steady barrage of sleaze and violence.
Schnabel is not exactly the ideal interpreter of Lou Reed's Berlin-years anguish. And the Berlin songs themselves don't transport one into that experience so much as convey a once-novel attitude.
An overall icky movie!
"For those who've ever pondered what a Skinemax flick sponsored by Human Rights Watch would look like, wonder no more."
"The premise for this chamber drama is inherently suspenseful, but not enough to sustain a movie so languorous that its chapters are demarcated by the various dinner courses, from aperitif to dessert. (After an hour I felt like loosening my belt.)"
"The beginning starts out strong as a psychological, terror rollercoaster ride infused with humor. Shortly thereafter, you realize the similarities of other films like Clue and Game Night is the moment when it all goes off track."
The hangover from The Hangover...
"Conventional, preachy and, worst of all, predictable."
Lost me about halfway through and never got me back.
"The best films in this franchise were fresh and original, with layers of thematic meaning and powerful resonance. By contrast, [Simon] Kinberg settles for a basic blockbuster."
The many opportunities to send up sex and psychiatry are thrown away when the film gets serious about Victor's bond with his mum. We are Freud alive.
"Unfortunately, it's not a great movie -- and given the filmmakers involved, that's a criminal disappointment."
"It's clear that Songbird is meant as a cautionary tale, but it's so clumsy in its messaging that it winds up feeling directionless and glib at best, and exploitive at worst."
[An] improbable and generally unfunny comedy.
"You'll find that in the end, you're still a dog person."
A morose and unconvincing drama about desperate love in a small North Carolina town.
"It's all Shock and Awe, but for what?"
"If Will's goal was for PINN to also experience the full range of human emotions, he failed, for Depp's performance here is cold and robotic."
"Lee's remake will strike a cord with unfamiliar audiences, but, for the most part, it's a hit-and-miss effort that comes close to good results."
"...with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum, I realized this is a throwaway movie that won't stand the test of time. It's a trifle."
If only Anderson went even further and muddied up the glassy waters.
The movie's ultimate reliance on wish-fulfillment is downright irresponsible.
"Plotting along at an infantile level, the story here is nothing new and hardly means anything."
The costumes' stiffness sucks the giddiness out of frequently preposterous plot turns.
"Basically, Grave Encounters 2 is so far up its own ass it almost disappears."
The Scout was directed by Michael Ritchie and written by Mr. Brooks and Monica Johnson from a script written by Andrew Bergman years ago. It's probably not all that valuable to wonder how so many talented people went so wrong.
"This could have just as easily been entitled ""UCLA"" for all the relevance it has to life at Annapolis. Lin apparently tried to combine ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" with ""From Here to Eternity"" and wound up with ""Alice in Wonderland."""
 Secret Headquarters is a wannabe start to a Spy Kids-style superhero franchise&#44; but that&#8217;s hard to do when there&#8217;s hardly anything &#8220;super&#8221; about it&#46;
This will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things.
"It's OK. It's probably passable, if you've got two hours to kill. But it's repetitive, excessively polite and also, given the subject matter, surprisingly dull."
"[It's] overstuffed with plot complications, overheated with bad acting and maudlin sentiment."
"Flat, abstruse, predictable and unable to raise your pulse rate higher than a blip on an EKG."
"Not smart enough, not thrilling enough, and a cop out born from marketing hype rather than one grown from well thought out scientific reasoning."
"In this instance opposites don't attract, they repel - audiences that is"
Cut one third of the interviews out&#46;&#46;&#46;and you&#8217;d have a more watchable&#44; more focused film&#46;
The most tedious crapfest I've sat through in a while. Annoying characters who never shut up. Even some amusing moments with Hopper can't save it.
"Plenty of families harbor resentments, but the goings-on here become ridiculous."
A commendable attempt by Haley to step into near-unfillable shoes is completely let down by a generic copy &amp; paste script and an overuse of unforgivable CGI&#46; Rooney Mara acts like she&apos;d rather be anywhere else and most audience members will feel the same&#46;
"For all its dependence on the truth, Rebel in the Rye comes across feeling like a big phony."
"The result is dull, predictable, and feels more standardized than one would imagine, given the subject matter and its attempts to be the DCEU's wildcard. "
"The story feels driven more by coincidence than authenticity, leading to an eye-rolling climax."
"Although there are a few good gags, The Hustle potters towards a predictable ending rather than ever being daring and stylish, let alone laugh-out-loud funny."
"Ant-Man cares more about setting up the future than addressing the present, and for that, Paul Rudd's best efforts as the wise-cracking insect companion are overshadowed by what's to come."
"In turning to the giallo with their new film The Editor, an especially mean-spirited horror subgenre, the filmmakers leave an especially bad taste."
"Despite a talented cast, ""Lazarus"" is a sub-par horror film taken from spare parts of more successful films."
It's impossible to tell whether the film's ending is happy because it's happy or because it's ending.
"The problem is, that half the time I laughed myself silly, while the other half, I was egregiously offended."
"The filmmakers use such a straight-laced and schmaltzy approach that ""The Identical"" might as well be a Hallmark TV movie."
A thoroughly mediocre action movie.
This cinematic portrait unfortunately never feels realistic or fully fleshed-out.
Morgan is an uneventful bore.
"Witless, lackluster and uneven despite a charismatic performance by Nicholas Hoult."
A mixed bag of old-school and contemporary horror tricks that occasionally raises a hair prickle of intrigue.
"Drenching the movie in so much mood is rough on the pacing, and there's a pointed lack of urgency to the search."
"Has some fun late-game action sequences (even if the story itself is mostly predictable and fails at almost every attempt of misdirection), but the grating characters do this one in long before the intensity ramps up"
"Though it holds your attention all the way through to an enigmatic, spiritually tinged climax, the movie leaves you wanting more than the Vega Vidals' secondhand artistry is able to provide."
"Demme can't sustain the fizz, but seeing a real filmmaker try and fall short is still more fun than watching a hack hit the mark."
"It's generic and ordinary and, although it contains sufficient material to engage children, its ability to hold the attention of older viewers is less sure."
"Now it can be said, Santa Claus is a fascist dictator who likes to kidnap and endanger children so that they can learn the true value of Christmas."
Plays like a low-budget Natural Born Killers -- and that is not intended as a compliment.
The smirking dialogue plays especially poorly in juxtaposition with the excessive violence.
"Director Laurence Dunmore films everything through a corrosive brown fog, obscuring and muffling the film's life force."
Battling to be heard above the metal-on-metal clangour is a heartwarming (read: terribly soppy) story of a broken family.
Thelma and Louise they ain't: dead-weight chemistry between the actresses makes this the road trip from hell.
It takes a vitally serious subject and makes such a relentlessly dumb hash of it.
It's all weighed down further by a drippy title character who wants to be anything but the title character.
"In rhythm, humor and performance, Morning Glory is, at best, sporadic."
"If you're aching for lines like, 'Well, that tunnel didn't dig itself,' and 'My enemy's enemy...is....my friend?,' run don't walk to AVP."
"If making the action beats more booming and more blunt is all you have in mind for capturing and amplifying the substance of the original product, then maybe you already got your head caught in a different kind of trap."
"Has some great elements but despite an anxiety-inducing droning soundtrack and a building sense of dread, it is not eerie enough to justify its overlong 95 minutes running time."
"The Rental is certainly entertaining enough to be worth a rental itself, but all of its aspirations to be something beyond that are ineffective and baffling"
A cautionary tale about getting mired in the past is itself hamstrung by what has come before: overplayed noir tropes and underbaked sci-fi ideas. The fab cast at least elevates this to the mediocre.
"The (latest in the) ultra-popular franchise ... finds itself functioning as cautionary tale of its narrative... just because something can be done, it doesn't mean it should."
"It goes without saying, if you have read this far, that I Am Number Four is very silly. But that's not to say its not enjoyable."
"In the end, the screenplay is the letdown, hewing too closely to generic convention."
"A squeaky-clean family of missionaries lives out their fantasy of ""saving"" a violent tribe of Ecuadorian jungle natives in this virulently wrong-headed movie."
"It's a wonder the actors aren't showing bruise marks from all the heavy-handed direction, the unrelenting solemnity of the thing."
"...a handsome, dutiful adaptation, yet like so many reverent movies based on acclaimed books, it's lifeless."
"Naomi's son Aidan has to be the most inner-directed child of all time. As he explained, 'You'd be introverted too if your imaginary friends had imaginary friends.'"
"There's plenty of space up there for a colony of mediocre filmmakers. That's right, folks. To the moon. Bang! Zoom!"
"It's not so much the well-worn template that's the problem here, it's the superficiality with which the story unspools."
"'The Tomorrow War' is another CGI action gloop-fest that's slugged its way onto Amazon Prime and has nothing to say for itself. Sure, it's going for big thrills and it's got Chris Pratt, but there's something so bland and annoyingly trite about it all."
"Mr. Murphy has two comic moments, which aren't enough for a feature-length film. Among other things, he has developed some of the same maddening mannerisms that marked Frank Sinatra's performances in his Rat Pack movies."
"...McCarthy's film seems to be looking for a different angle than his previous efforts, so the lingering effect (and the film is guilty of doing too much of that) leans toward being something quite long-in-the-tooth."
The film that surrounds [Fanning] is sadly no match for the qualities she brings to Potter's profoundly personal narrative.
"Barney's ideas about creation and identity don't really seem all that profound, at least by way of what can be gleaned from this three-hour endurance test built around an hour's worth of actual material."
"Full Battle Rattle often seems content to merely work its way toward the concluding notion that, if our armed forces can't cut it in fake Iraq, they'll never be able to handle the real deal."
"How can a director as savvy as Lee make so many errors of judgment regarding taste, tone, intention and dramatic structure?"
Harrelson has one of the better characters in the film and Peet does a good job.
"Ultimately, despite its intriguing premise and loaded potential, Awake is a generic, unconvincing snoozefest."
"The film is a wash, first and foremost for Hogan and cinematographer Donald McAlpine's choice to shoot entire sequences in garish singular colors."
Rio 2 feels less like a new adventure and a lot like an excuse to do more of the same.
"Smith's pictures deliver familiar pleasures; they work with efficiency but not inspiration, honoring the time-honored movie platitudes that will neither shock nor stretch an audience."
"Perhaps you remember ""The Pick-Up Artist,"" the movie that single-handedly killed Molly Ringwald's career? That was another Toback production. ""Black and White,"" for all its arty pretensions and supposed shock value, doesn't break his losing streak."
...the narrative adopts a decidedly repetitious and meandering feel in its midsection...
You're always aware that you're watching filmed theater.
"This wants to spoof macho action movies.... But lacking a coherent script to link the jokes, these Angels are left without a prayer."
"Overbearing, immensely popular pro-vigilante drama."
"A certain grave respect was owed firemen even before Sept. 11, 2001, but Ladder 49 doesn't earn the piety it wants."
"A waste of talent and money, Pluto Nash seems convinced that simply sticking Eddie Murphy in outer space with expensive special effects will produce laughs."
"Time to Leave winds up a tiresome affirmation of man's biological duty to procreate; the position is simplistic verging on obnoxious, especially after 5x2's attack on the hetero family model."
"The Rise of Skywalker is another of those zillion-dollar franchise films where I felt embarrassed for the actors but pleased for them, too, because the money is no doubt amazing and will presumably free them to do things they care about."
"This is a manic, overmedicated, and remembered elegy. It's also private, personal, and obscure, a ballad meant more for its subjects' eyes and ears than ours."
"It's hard to say if the muddle ""Joker"" makes of itself arises from confusion or cowardice, but the result is less a depiction of nihilism than a story about nothing."
The style isn't matched by the substance in a film that strains unsuccessfully to be taken seriously.
Schumaker proves that someone CAN make a Batman movie even worse than Burton. Val Kilmer's portrayal of the Dark Knight is stilted and lifeless.
"[A] disappointing muddle of concert footage, unfocused interviews, dated psychedelia, and indifferently staged dramatic scenes centered on jazz great Ornette Coleman."
It doesn't really feel interested in Seal as a character - we don't find out much about him other than the things that supposedly happened to him without any real insight into his decisions or why he made them.
The film could use a little more Wilson and a lot less Pena&#46;
16 Blocks fails to impress as either an action film or a buddy movie. Almost every effect it reaches for falls short.
"Despite some style, too much torrid steam is off-screen and too little rancor coalesces and festers to truly shock."
Everything Money Monster has to say about corporate greed is true but as a film it also leaves no contrivance unturned or untouched.
Highly entertaining but practically incomprehensible.
"Anyone who has cringed while watching the home movies of newlyweds bumbling through their own corny, personalized nuptials will appreciate the comic potential of the British mock documentary Confetti."
"It's a hollow imitation of the series, unable to meet its most basic visual and narrative expectations. It's also a bad film in general, which tries to tell a socially relevant story that it can't seem to handle."
A largely limp teen comedy drama&#46;&#46;&#46;Though the cast is attractive and nicely wardrobed in fashions colour-coded to match the set design&#44; the central performances are surprisingly lacklustre&#44; with many scenes feeling like filmed rehearsals&#46;
"This soft, squidgy sequel squanders its comic not-quite-crappiness by padding out its length and getting seriously dull in its exploration of a talking bear's 'personhood.' (Paddington versus Descartes, anyone? I thought not, therefore I zzzzzzzz.)"
"Lazily and cynically conceived, this is the closest thing to a child labor violation ever released by a major studio."
"It plays with the idea that all rebellion is in some sense performed and makes a caricature out of the immature, attention-hungry mother, but it never liberates its characters from their molds."
"Yes, the canon invoked for this film is that of the Three Stooges, but it's still not as magnificently berserk as they can be. Set your expectations carefully for this one."
If this were the feature-length pilot episode for some cheap reboot on a streaming service - which is what it feels like - a generous viewer might half-heartedly agree to tune in next week and see if things get more interesting.
"Director John Singleton ratchets up the violence to mixed results: Sometimes it heightens the action, other times it's cartoonish."
It would be fair to conclude that Elvis would have benefited from a little more restraint and sobriety. The picture would then have been infinitely less blurry and far more memorable.
"This is a purported comedy, loosely and irresponsibly based on a children's novel, that only Leona Helmsley could love."
"Jensen positions ""Men & Chicken"" as a fablelike ode to humanism and tolerance, but his obsession with brutish sexuality and mean, slapstick humor makes that claim feel unearned and glib."
This discordant rom-com caper has all the charm of a lobotomized poodle; fluffy and without all the necessary faculties to function.
The movie has the feel of several episodes of a series that have been jammed into a feature-length helping.
"Deadening, dull, sepia-drenched faux-noir period hokum of a suddenly popular variety."
"It quickly becomes obvious that instead of finding a fresh angle of approach, the filmmakers have simply given us yet another fish-out-of-water fantasy a la ""Splash."""
"Incoherent, ugly and lacking in any kind of flash or dazzle."
"It's tolerable, I suppose, if you don't have to listen to it. Unfortunately it's a musical so you have to listen to it."
"The rotoscoping animation looks beautiful and striking. But as much as I enjoy listening to most of Jack Black's wonderfully subdued voiceover narration in this film, it lacks neither a strong emotional nor storytelling hook to keep me occupied."
"Despite the obligatory eclectic soundtrack, there aren't many surprises nor reasons to care about why these two should be together."
"It might have been fun, but [director Bob] Dolman focuses on all the wrong things."
"Journey relentlessly dishes out the action and offers the bespectacled audience plenty of goopy, grabby 3-D jolts, but it all resembles a run of the mill video game. Brevig can't shake the material loose from its unbridled artificiality."""
By the time the film gets into the home stretch it goes totally off the rails...
The storyline is so nonsensical that everything around it becomes a waste of time and effort.
Gadon as the sheet-warming lady-in-waiting is given little to do but look naive and dumbstruck.
"As the British might say, it's bloody awful."
There are porn films with more naturalistic dialogue&#46;
"The performances are determinedly low-key, and Ms. Coixet directs even the most charged scenes in a cool, almost affectless style. But the implicit narcissism of the film's title is embraced without really being examined."
...an exceedingly sluggish and underwhelming drama...
"An empty, pretty thing... little more than a string of breathtaking vistas best suited for months of playback in the home theater section of your local Best Buy."
"There are no pecs and no leather Speedos, but there is a baffled general who, when facing defeat, blurts out the iconic line: ""This is madness!"""
Underworld: Blood Wars is a poorly-constructed slog of a sequel that fails to engage the audience in any impactful manner.
Zhao Shuzhen is excellent as Nai Nai but Awkwafina is decidedly ordinary.
"Although this is never less than watchable, you can't help feeling that it would have been a better film if they'd waited a year or so and actually included details of the players' futures."
I expected more from Rob Reiner.
"Naturally... we see all sides of Patton, but are exposed only to the more shallow surfaces of the other characters."
It's a credit to Adams' performance that the movie works for as long as it does.
"The Mysteries of Pittsburgh is a coming-of-ager that nearly slaughters you by minute 30 with the relentlessness of its protagonist's voiceovers, as scripted--with reverence and without cinematic wiles--by director Rawson Marshall Thurber."
"This is spectacular entertainment, practically a theme park ride, that could have used more spirituality and soul."
"Above all a meditation on loneliness, the narrative is frequently interrupted by static landscape shots accompanied by Aimie reading letters to her absent dad -- stabs at poetry that feel less poetic, and more calculated, with every recurrence."
"Despite a high-concept idea and a good cast, this crime thriller feels somewhat half-baked and rushed. It might once have been promising, but it seems like something went wrong along the way."
There's an element so relevant to the credibility of the story that the script avoids completely and it's shocking this fundamental defect isn't provoking more contempt.
The film is so focused on the experimental visuals that it renounces any kind of coherent plot. [Full review in Spanish]
"Sydney Pollack can't locate any kind of chemistry between Ford and Thomas, whose first and last scenes together are especially labored."
"Despite the fine performances, Brick Lane comes across as a nice soap opera when it promised much more."
"Coming less than a month into the new year, prospective viewers would do wise to lower their expectations accordingly."
"Boo! feels like a one-note television sketch that runs on and on and never really goes anywhere. This isn't perceptive nor inspired comedy; it's lazy, self-referential, and tired."
"The really sad thing is that this is a movie with some intriguing characters that has some real comic and dramatic potential, but all this gets lost in increasingly silly plot mechanics."
"One day Cosmopolis may well have either been completely forgotten - or seen to have been ahead of its time, hugely influential and something of an overlooked classic experiment."
"Though never boring, Impostor is downright depressing because it's so easy to catch glimpses of the knockout film that lies buried underneath Fleder's mangled direction."
"The film is dour and lumbering, with only a handful of rousing scenes to justify the blatantly financial choice to split the novel into two films."
"It's not just bad, it's a sad excuse for a movie"
Too often falls back on poorly implemented hit or miss crude humor
80 minutes of sweaty boredom [and] laughable action gimmicks.
[The main] character is so passive it is hard to feel much for him as he sits around and wastes most of what little time he has.
"Like an unreliable car, Ford v Ferrari works only in spurts."
"...an adventure story with no adventure, a heroic tale with no hero, and a very long afternoon at the movies without nearly enough in the way of a payoff."
Cop Out could have been an American equivalent of Hot Fuzz but it instead feels like an anachronistic forgotten film that you once owned on VHS.
"There are graceful Woo touches even outside the action scenes, like the swaying of sheep as a helicopter buzzes their pen in the Outback. But it's not enough to get over the blandness."
"Mac and Me directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, and it's exactly as good as that sounds."
So bogged down in plot that it has little in the way of suspense.
City of Men is an intriguing but incompletely developed heir to the far superior City of God.
Sonnenfeld gives us little more than a massive slimy serving of aliens on a sloppy summer platter.
"It's a free world, Ken Loach asserts in his latest film with well-practiced disgust and unfortunately little hope."
"A polished and preposterous thriller, The Interpreter offers two excellent actors a chance to show off, but it's not half as important as it thinks it is."
Carter gives every sports-drama cliche a chance to play. No bad idea is benched.
"Unfortunately, Monsters is relentlessly derivative and a watered-down sci-fi saga that the tweens and teens will tune out with all the nonchalant gesture of popping a stubborn pimple on their faces."
Mad Max Heads for the Angry Red Planet on a Pitch Black Night of the Living Dead.
A failed allegory driven by TAXI DRIVER'S music and TD's evocative gritty cinematography. Bad acts are okay if you are poor.
"A comedy with silly music, long patriotic speeches, ham-fisted acting and the villain is Hitler's signature."
"This movie has a modern kind of badness to it, the kind that's only possible in an era of mind-boggling technological advancements and de-emphasized storytelling."
"Life of the Party is proof that even the funniest actors need good material, which makes it all the more disappointing that McCarthy wrote the script with director Ben Falcone, who is also her husband."
"Unfortunately Morgan Freeman, the compassionate, helpless U.S. president, and Robert Duvall, an astronaut who finds he hasn't passed his prime, have less time on-screen than Tea Leoni, who's unconvincing as a journalist."
It's like a treasure hunt to uncover the nuggets of brilliance hidden beneath the tangled mess of six interweaving storylines.
Nothing that happens comes as much of a surprise.
"One scene features a pair of bickering Transformers voiced by John Goodman and Steve Buscemi. With John Turturro also appearing in the film, it's safe to say THIS is the reunion movie that The Big Lebowski devotees were eagerly awaiting."
"The Broken Lizard quintet follows its quintessential cult-comedy classic ""Super Troopers"" with something like ""Ten Little Indians"" interpreted by five big imbeciles - a slasher parody three ""Screams"" and three ""Scary Movies"" too late."
The cast is great... The problem here is a poor script and even poorer dialogue. [Full review in Spanish]
The story is involving but the character are types rather than authentic individuals.
I guess we can give it a golf clap or two for trying.
"For its ticket price, failed antagonist, and ultimately forgettable emotional arcs, I'd save this one for a plane."
Todd Haynes' Wonderstruck is a childhood fable brimming with lush visuals yet too wispy to bear them.
The material is as facile and phony as any Meg Ryan romcom.
"Haws follow hees as hayseeds rip around in fast cars, churning dust and making faces very close to the camera."
"While Nobody Else But You aspires to a kind of French Fargo, it forgets the primary qualities that made that film work."
Feels more like a rejected X-Files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening.
"The most striking thing about Platoon is how ordinary it is. Even, at times, banal."
"""The Mummy"" is a dated, empirically dismal, laughable excuse to kick off a franchise, and it should have remained entombed."
The pleasures here come from watching an extraordinary physical specimen go through a lo-tech workout routine thousands of feet above the ground as he tries to rescue his family from a burning superskyscraper.
Thrillers don't get much more generic than this.
"In its painful straining to be upbeat, this movie jettisons anything real."
"It is about helplessness and evil, but isn't merciless enough."
The cinematic equivalent of a shrug ... barrels through its mild laughs and rote action as if there's a prize for delivering a movie in 90 minutes or less.
"While the picture is a superior depiction of the fractured mind at play, it doesn't successfully capture the nature of Harvey Pekar the way his comics have done for him all these years."
Horrible sequel to the classic 2001.
Spending 100 minutes watching likeable stars trapped in something this witless and artless is profoundly depressing&#46;
"The Laundromat is a scattered, disappointing effort by Soderbergh that fails to make the most its source material and talented ensemble."
"Carrey gives the worst performance of his, or indeed any other actor's, career."
Whether one installs the silent 'up a creek' preamble to the title depends on how you feel about serious silliness.
"What&#8217;s with the film&#8217;s odd preoccupation with such adult themes as class, money, and sex?"
"While the animation, particularly in the action set pieces, is indeed well done, it's nothing revolutionary nor imaginative that stands out from the rest in this CG-feature-a-week marketplace."
"While '06 is still young, chances are, 12 months from now, Grandma's Boy will rank as one of the year's worst comedies. Munich offers more laughs."
"All of the prettiest pictures of mother nature couldn't save To The Wonder from being a lifeless, overly-poetic bore that fails to keep a consistently flowing story intact."
"Nice try, but they probably should have just left the original Nightmare on Elm Street as is."
Writer/director Anders Morganthaler has made an odd film that seems as unsure of its point as it does its execution.
"In spite of heartfelt performances from John Hurt and Hugh Dancy, director Michael Caton-Jones (""Scandal"") keeps an arm's distance from his volatile subject and fails to expand on an epic tragedy that is being replicated in places like Darfur."
It's a first-class production of an empty concept and an utterly dead script.
"In the cautionary dystopian science-fiction parable The Perfect Man, we are offered a terrifying vision of a possible future: a world ruled by Hilary Duff."
"...it is a shame that Max Winkler's debut, with its muddy gender politics, isn't a better film."
Unfortunately&#44; it has little emotional force and the characters function as simple figures of clay that are burned over a slow fire only to add some depth to a text as inane as it is pretentious&#46; &#91;Full review in Spanish&#93;
Calling Short Circuit 2 a movie is like calling Cool Whip dinner.
"Spurlock's film is fitfully engaging in its own facile way, but also restless and unfocused -- and thus it never really digs into its subject matter in a deep or interesting enough way."
Brushing your teeth is more fun
Beans holds no surprises. It is a missed opportunity at telling the story of the Kanesatake standoff.
"After such a triumph with A Thousand Clouds of Peace (Mil Nubes de Paz Cercan el Cielo) the second installment in Julin Hernndez's apparent ""Cielo"" series is a sluggish disappointment."
More like snips and snails and puppy dog tails.
"Despite its scalpel-like precision, pic falls short of its titular promise, never quite getting under the skin as it should."
The moviegoers are passive hostages on a long ride they've taken so many times before. So gameboys are advised to man their PlayStations this weekend; action-movie fans in search of red meat can wait for the inevitably more graphic DVD version.
"I was so bored, and so depressed by the mechanics of it."
The hangover on the third day of a three-day binge makes you wonder why you decided to go there in the first place. Apparently it's the same for movies.
"Strong acting and some fine moments, but its ending is too pat and its script is too preachy"
A ridiculous comedy whose greatest sin is one of omission: a lack of humor. And that's a hard one to forgive.
"Not only are the shifts in time unclear, but the film lacks a stable emotional tone."
"Even more than most horror films, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, feels desperately unoriginal"
"It's not funny, it's not romantic, it's not exciting, it's not for children, it's not remotely interesting."
"There are some films that are hardly worth the trouble of watching: once you've got the central concept, you can pretty much run the movie in your head."
It's slow. Its characters are anorexic. The dialogue is mostly forgettable. Jake Lloyd delivers something short of an exciting performance.
Much of what is captured will be familiar for viewers of Frontline or other recent documentaries.
"Despite the millions clearly poured into it, the film feels cheap and amateurish. See it on IMAX if you wish, but the flaws will only look bigger."
"Sometimes, even a little gratuitous nudity can't save a movie. This is one of those occasions."
Burt Reynolds and Cybill Shepherd sing and dance...badly! But the lively supporting cast and the art deco production design deserve merit.
"In a bloodless scene between two old men, there's more pathos and tension... than in any of the hyper-kinetic fight scenes or car chases that pad out the rest of the running time."
Watching Hanna is like watching someone else play a really expensive video game...
"A serious case of the cutes...Pellington knows his movie is more or less bad, but Shirley there's an audience for it."
"After his persuasively disturbing screenplay for Larry Clark's Kids, Harmony Korine 's Gummo comes as a disappointment."
"Suki Waterhouse...is utterly dreadful, but perhaps she hated the material and figured even ""phoning it in"" wasn't worth the effort."
"Never comes close to being interesting or entertaining.
[Full review in Spanish]"
"Do women desirous of offspring actually throw ""I'm Getting Pregnant"" parties at which their chosen sperm donor arrives bearing baby juice in a plastic cup?"
"Butler's presence makes perfect sense. He's an empty, mindless vessel. Just like his movie."
"Like many Christmases, the whole thing leaves you stressed, exasperated and longing to leave for home."
"Apart from a few serious leaps in logic, the story moves along swiftly and painlessly, and is not needlessly cute or stupid. But that's not much of a recommendation."
"Like the drug that everyone is chasing after, Project Power fizzles out after five minutes -- the trouble is that when that happens here, it still has 106 more to go."
"Though it tries to juice up its mojo with currently popular Asian themes and martial-arts sequences, this Mummy seems a teeny bit musty."
"The ambitions of writer-director Stacie Passon's plot feel too tame, revving up to a scene of shame rather than radical revision. The Kids Are All Right pushed similar material to more affecting ends."
"Normally, I subscribe to the theory that Hoffman and Hackman - and Cusack, too - elevate any movie they grace and are worth following anywhere. In this case, I declare a mistrial."
It's like a music video of Helen Reddy's 'I Am Woman' filmed in the Chevy Chase Pottery Barn.
"Shallow, silly yet infectiously good-natured, this is as guiltily pleasurable as dystopia gets."
Ultimately the kind of film that will give you quick laughs that will fade just as quickly.
Michael Bay's Schindler's List.
"Hudgens' best work here is physical. She eats voraciously, like an animal, and exudes a mix of anger, sadness and deep discomfort. Her spoken lines are less effective, and that's partly due to a script often filled with cliches."
"Another telling example (""The Brown Bunny,"" ""Anatomy of Hell,"" Bellocchio's ""Devil in the Flesh"") that hardcore sex seems better suited to hardcore sex films."
Ali does the unthinkable: making its complex and dynamic subject smaller than life.
"Yes, synchronised swimming has finally got the comedy that nobody thought it needed."
Fergus is blessed with a cast who can duck-and-weave with his shabby material.
"Unfortunately, Broken lives up to its mawkish title, and the slice-of-life tragedies of the film's first half devolve into manipulative melodrama in the latter part."
"An overrated film. DiCaprio gives a great performance as a mentally retarded boy. It's so good, in fact, that's it's difficult to watch."
Loses steam faster than a cup of hot cocoa on a frozen lake.
Stupid but funny and offbeat.
Chugs along until it finally arrives at a revelation that feels as predictable as it is unenthusiastically rendered.
"Though ambitious, this documentary-feature hybrid, which includes both actors and the real-life characters they play, fails to fully engage or inspire much empathy."
"When the YouTube tricks are stretched across a big screen for an hour and 40 minutes, padded with a whole lot of static, they struggle to carry their own weight."
"If all you want is special effects, you may have come to the right galaxy. But if you're looking for old-fashioned goofiness, you'll be shouting, ""Beam me up, Scotty!'' Or whatever the Lost in Space equivalent of that is."
"Cluttered, overly plotted and too much is too easily resolved. As sincere an effort as it is, it would take a much better script to overcome all of that."
This could've been an absolutely excellent horror romp if there were better practical effects and not so much reliance on the bad CGI.
"This feature is like a double header, two sets of clichs for the price of one."
"You may not get your money's worth, but you can't say you don't get what you asked for."
"Fumbles its football overcoming tragedy approach with tired perspectives, uninspired performances and lousy editing."
Melissa McCarthy meet Michelle Darnell . You really should get to know each other better.
"All but exemplifies bad erotica, with Otis' quivery fragility and Rourke's skeezy ooziness."
There's no reason a movie where these two play star-crossed lovers should be this dull.
"The characters are paper-thin, the plot is super predictable, and despite its star-studded cast... only Robert Pattinson seems like he's having any fun."
There is absolutely room for female action stars in the contemporary film canon but Miss Bala fails to make the case.
"Based on a comic-book series, it feels formulaic, unconvincing and disappointing."
This isn't a culmination. It's a fortuitously convenient rendezvous promising more interesting plots to come.
"The bawdy wit and crisp dialogue that were the hallmark of Apatow's Knocked Up are still present, but the conflicts feel so cushy that one gets the impression that the filmmaker is losing touch with life as it is lived outside of Brentwood."
"You can feel the company's hands all over Orange County, which is a shame because if left alone, the film might have turned out to be another Election."
[T]he screenplay ... lets its obsession with mystery get the better of it.
"In terms of feeling like this production genuinely delivered, that's one mountain The Sound of Music Live! just couldn't climb."
"(Minions are)funny, in a Madagascar penguins or Pizza Planet little green men sort of way, one-joke bit players whose appeal was underestimated before and overestimated now... Butt out, Minions."
"Lending itself to nothing, it goes around killing people for no reason...pointless."
"Up the pole, out to lunch and off the grid. It is mad, mannerist and unmanageable."
Strong on the martial arts skills but weak on the acting and screenplay
Boseman brings more depth and complexity to his role than the screenplay warrants.
"Even though the movie is perfectly shot, it gradually feels like more of the same thing. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The filmmakers thought that all it would take to make a movie is some special effects, but this film only goes to show what most people already know: a film shouldn't be designed around something meant to be an afterthought."
"Rank even on its own terms, it's the kind of inferior remake that also invites questions about the original's cult status."
Sluggish and overlong compared to its stellar predecessor.
About as much fun as a Pap smear.
"""Return to Sender"" is unsatisfying on many levels, but its most egregious sin is how it opts for Lifetime Movie dullness instead of nail-biting sophistication."
"While the film isn't painful to watch, and not just because it's easy on the eyes, it's a pointless affair."
"More of a curiosity than a cohesive sampling of cinematic visions, ""Tokyo!"" fails to impress."
All the money in the world&#44; and &#8220;Glass Onion&#8221; never feels meaningfully engaged in any aesthetically definitive approach to a mystery instead it is overwhelmed by a strangely incurious approach to the people&#44; the locales and itself&#46;
"he film's pallid emotional tone, which is in sync with the constancy of the dull gray sky overhead, can make it a hard story to embrace."
"You know the bad guys and you know the why. Without some much-needed plot punch and places where you really worry about the characters, the concept fizzles."
"The Curse of Audrey Earnshaw is long on mystery and ambiance, short on resolution and closure. It's a question without a satisfying answer, a curse with no cure."
A blatant rip-off of Eddie Murphy's The Golden Child from 1986.
Audiences have understandably not taken kindly to the filmmakers' artistic licence.
The curse of the new Bennifer has birthed a deformed fury that not even sexy red ninja lingerie could save
"Haddish and Byrne, whose stars shined so brightly in the laugh-filled ""Girl's Trip"" and ""Spy,"" do their best to elevate the material but can't put lipstick on this pig."
"Devoted fans of the series may find themselves comforted by the presence of old friends, but Vince and his troupe are very unlikely to make new ones."
let's just call this Grumpiest Old Men and get it over with
"While it's supposed to add up to a witty marriage between romance and anarchy, it's so light on moral implications that it's just tacky."
"An overstated, unashamedly silly summer adventure."
"The film's message is that all of society is corrupt, so it doesn't matter who gets killed. It's a propaganda movie that shows no empathy for its characters or for its audience."
"Segal's characterization is something of a puzzle. It is not consistent, is full of mannerisms and is seldom believable."
Clever&#44; up to a point&#44; the film is buoyed by Adams&#8217; charm&#44; her portrayal of Giselle&#8217;s well-intentioned naiveite generating big laughs&#44; as do her struggles when her evil nature tries to emerge&#46; Marsden is also a delight as the overenthusiastic prince&#46;
There's nothing here to match the silly run-amok creativity that marked the first.
"Ineptly written, ideologically muddled and unintentionally hilarious!"
"I don't wish to seem ungrateful, as Brydon and Coogan have given me great pleasure and many laughs in the past--but was this half-hearted film (edited down, like the other features, from a six-part British TV series) really necessary?"
"Dumb, hypocritical, and a complete waste of time."
"Cruise has almost nothing going for him this time around in the way of props, and even less than usual in the way of character."
Made-for-TV-pap with a couple of big stars in the leads.
It's a direct-to-DVD-quality effort with a byzantine pulp-airport-novel plot line.
"Some things will never change within the tedious and surprisingly long-running SF/horror saga 'Underworld' film franchise. Kinda makes you consider putting a stake through your own chest, huh?"
"The more we learn about the main characters, the less we believe they'd do the things they do."
It's not that the Fright Night remake is that bad. It's just not that good.
The first film from OutKast iconoclasts Andr Benjamin (Andr 3000) and Antwan A. Patton (Big Boi) has all the wit and creativity of their music videos. And here's the bad news: That makes it at least an hour too long.
"Saw the Light is not a movie that ever catches fire. One hopes the story will be told again, with more emphasis on what went on inside Hank Williams than on what went on around him."
"The only solace from the uninspired characters and crammed-in factoids are the gags about poop and puke - juvenile, yes, but also appropriate for the film's ""back to nature"" ethos."
Pretty okay when no one is talking.
"Suffice to say that Rory's Way doesn't break much fresh ground and appears to be content with running a by-the-numbers routine that snuggles up to a very risk-free screenplay and a comfy score drumming to the bland beat of ""mediocre""."
There's not a moment in the film's belabored 115-minute running time that feels emotionally authentic.
There's not much innovation in the story nor in the characters. [Full revew in Spanish]
"S lot of talent gets expended in Stay. (I'm not including whoever dressed McGregor.) Too bad the movie they made, while effective in short spurts, is almost a complete waste of time."
"Like a novelty cover band, Wiseman's ""Total Recall"" [goes] through a checklist of ""things you have to do if you do a 'Total Recall.'"""
"""The Woman in the Window"" would like to be a contempo ""Rear Window,"" but it's so riddled with things you can't buy that it plays like a bad Brian De Palma movie minus the camera movement."
You could get whiplash from his movie's mood swings.
"The film is very slow and prone to embarrassing attempts at humour: Beatrix smokes a joint and becomes fascinated by airplanes, for example. Ha, ha."
"This is populist wish fulfillment, pure and simple."
There's not much wonder that practically everybody who had anything to do with the making of this film was offering excuses and alibis when it opened in Europe in 1962.
The movie bites off way too much. It lumbers inelegantly between confrontations with grief and fascism.
"A numbed, exhausting rigidity -- which could be read as an echo of whatever's bugging Don for reasons that are clearly none of our business -- infects the whole movie."
"An earnest, obvious melodrama with no soul, filled with the longing silences that come after a sigh."
"The script is never nearly as clever as the premise ought to allow, and the madcap fun is far too frequently derailed by tonal inconsistencies."
...this story is better told as a documentary rather than narrative feature.
"The awkwardly titled ""Unfreedom"" clearly waves the flag for acceptance and nonviolence - but it would be more effective if it invested as much in some cinematic nuance."
"If the light from your mobile device weren't likely to disrupt the experience of others, I'd suggest that this is one journey on which you might consider bringing a book -- perhaps something by Agatha Christie."
"Yet again a crew sniffs after a mysterious ping and sticks their nose in a deadly larva pod. Are our astronauts learning? God no. And if the audience expected a different plot, we're not learning, either."
"""Jojo Rabbit"" exists in service of a single idea, a notion so desperately idealistic that it lands somewhere between naïveté and disingenuousness."
"This lowbrow sequel is such a putrid blast of bad taste that, at times, it's hard to even pay attention to what's happening on the big screen."
Heavy on style and atmosphere and light on virtually everything else.
"A restrained Ribisi convinces as an Italian, though if ever a movie needed one of the actor's whiny jags to pump it up, this has to be among the rare ones."
Patriotic and action-packed - just don't expect accuracy or clarity.
"The film isn't enough fun to recommend on its own terms, with its sloppy construction and so little in the way of stylistic flourishes."
"The outdated, cliche-riddled direction is so inept and indifferent that it's hard to believe Twisted was lensed by the same Philip Kaufman who made The Right Stuff."
"As happens occasionally on the putting green, there are brief flashes of tension and drama, but more often it's a long slog to the 18th hole as thoughts drift to that icy martini waiting in the clubhouse."
"As it stands, ""Big Eyes"" was the last good Burton movie, 2007's ""Sweeney Todd"" was the last great one."
A muddled sort of horror pic set as a WWII B-movie period piece thriller about Hitler&apos;s corpse&#46;
Jolie and Depp have no chemistry whatsoever. They go about their business here with the twinkling elan of two actors waiting for their checks to clear.
"The film should have been called Lock, Stock and Two Wilting Barrels."
"The trouble is that the film does not do enough to endear us to Tommy or to his moronic friends. Meanwhile, the simplistic story meanders through several clichéd structural devices."
It may take cattle prods ... to keep most people from walking out of this explosively awful monster mash.
"[Cats] doesn't really work. And, more often than not, it's a grotesque burlesque. But it does have a few warm, furry moments."
"Mumblecore without the thrills. 'Endings, Beginnings' is staring so intensely at its own navel that its head is embedded in its own abdomen."
"A bad marriage of martial arts and action spoofery, bungled by director John Carpenter working from the world's worst screenplay."
This bloody mash up of Christian Bale and Edgar Allan Poe never gets off the ground&#46; 
"It's not Godzilla vs. Mothra, but the slight coming-of-age story Driving Lessons does set up something of a clash of the titans, with Julie Walters and Laura Linney providing a master class in overacting."
"I don't know any of those [prior] versions, and I wonder how (which means I doubt that) they avoided the snare that Wharton unwittingly set for her adapters, the snare that, for all his gifts, caught Scorsese."
"Quick, somebody grab a dictionary and show director Peter Cornwell the difference between homage and grand larceny."
"It is atrociously bad, basically."
"It's all awful enough that you expect the movie to end with a title card that proclaims, ""Don't worry, guys - we have gay friends and black friends. We're cool."""
"It's City Slickers. I mean, come on."
"What's the point in warning of the perils of the information age by creating a scareless, formulaic film that fits so snugly into the thoughtless consumerism of the culture you're trying to criticize?"
For completists of the franchise&#44; it offers a satisfactory conclusion to this particular trilogy&#44; but movie fans in general will likely find it lacking&#46;
... seems both stripped down in complexity for a new audience as well as cut into a bite-sized chunk to more easily swallow... neither of which is going to draw new fans to the franchise or keep current fans interested.
"Reno 911!: Miami is too safe and unremarkable to be a crime against comedy a la Norbit, but anyone in search of a laugh feels robbed all the same."
... it feels more like something out of American cinema from the late 1960s or early 70s [and] may say more about the state of Australian film than anything else.
Not only slow but uninvolving.
The humor &#40;some of it steeped in nostalgia and sentimentality&#41;&#44; even during the more notorious sequences&#44; is never strong enough to transcend the limitations of its minimal scope and setting and lack of a traditional narrative&#46;
&#91;T&#93;he degree of difficulty and desperation here comes across as more than a bit disingenuous&#46;
"Based on a popular videogame (that I freely admit to have never played), Hitman is so bad it makes the collected films of Paul W.S. Anderson look like cinematic works of genius."
"You have the slightest of romps, and one that ends so abruptly that you suspect the prolific Veber had already moved on to his next project."
Utterly bereft of either comedy or thrills.
"The Order is scuzzy and lazy, such a muddle that no one really need be offended. Actually, no one need even bother with it all. That's why I'm being paid in this space, to spare you the temptation."
The plot is about as deep as the water into which they dive.
"Despite an overall sensation of dread and moodiness, ""The Vast of Night"" never turns that into legitimate tension or pressure. It certainly feels vaguely eerie and unnerving, but lacks narrative urgency and the philosophical depth."
The same video game that bored us two years ago. [Full review in Spanish]
"The first third is frankly plodding, though the story begins to engage us by the midpoint. While there is nothing wrong with Roache's or Das's work, Bose's performance gives it whatever power it has."
"Hanks carries the film with his personality and his easy address to the camera, but this oddity of a film never quite comes to life."
Splitting the film almost evenly between Hampton and O'Neal takes the focus off of the tragic figure at the story's heart.
Barris and Hill missed creating a truly bold example for this current climate and stayed safe within glamor and predictability&#46;
"A schlocky, derivative, and incredibly ridiculous sequel."
Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone return as Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey in this long - very long - two and a half hour long - did we mention its long? - sequel. They didn't quite use their spidey-sense in the cutting room.
"The desperation to overdo everything ruins what might otherwise have been a charming little rom-com, with likable stars, great co-stars, and some sharp bits of dialogue."
I have heard the cash cow moo...the sort of movie many will feel obliged to like more than they actually want to clamor right back onto the ride.
Coco hits all the right notes but still feels like the same old song
"This film is so formulaic, so thoroughly what you'd expect that by the time you're done watching it you feel like you've just seen it for the second time."
"Too much of the time ""Hitchcock"" plays cute and comfortable. It simply lacks weight."
"You can't help but feel a little, when watching Bedazzled, like Fraser and Hurley have sold their talents short in this episodically silly film."
"An empty enterprise that provides a few moments of goofy fun, Mirrors reflects back nothing."
"Wheatly is an ambitious and talented director that has proven his skill... but his vision is overshadowed by a miriad of subplots, making this film a minor one in his filmography. [Full review in Spanish]"
Featuring fractured moments of stellar performance from George MacKay...the film still can't synthesize what it's trying to convey-and what exactly it's trying to critique.
"Post Grad isn't funny, surprising, or insightful enough to provoke more than a ho-hum reaction."
"That the anti-climactic finish was withheld from advance reviewers to save the surprise is short for It's really, really stupid."
"""Exposed"" is a mess and completely forgettable, but perhaps it's more interesting as a lost movie, with its true form caught between the demands of its financier and the vision of its original creator."
Probably the least rambunctious film that could've been made on the subject.
The twists are violent and silly and have little relation to the gritty realities of Snider's world.
"The special effects are fast, frequent, and generally overwhelming; they look stunning, for the most part, but their sheen wears off when 99% of the imagery is CG."
"One of worst movies of the summer: Lame, unoriginal, and not particularly funny."
"A Rashomon-like tale that tells its story from different perspectives, this fact-based adaptation of Eric Jager's book is muddy, bloody and grim but too drawn out in filtering 14th-century feudal norms through a modern prism."
"The laughs are few and far-between, and the ending doesn't come soon enough"
We've entered a golden age of movies that use state-of-the-art technology to rail against the use of state-of-the-art technology.
"It's harmless stuff, to be sure, but almost invisible, it disappears from memory so fast. A stealth comedy, perhaps?"
What a horrible little movie.
"More concerned with stuffing history than constructing it, Shaw's film focuses on creating a visual overstimulation with the discursive complexity of Avatar."
Even Space Chimps was better.
Redford should have spent more time thinking about his characters than about the meaning of it all.
"Predictable 'oldie' jokes about mobility scooters, farts and 'moobs' abound in a film that can't decide if it's a low-denominator, wobbly-kneed comedy or a hotdog-for-brains version of The Wrestler."
"With The Brothers Solomon, Will Arnett continues to squander the goodwill he engendered as Gob on Arrested Development."
"It is excruciatingly, painfully, horribly, terribly awful."
It's insulting to the Hitchcocks and to the audience.
"Hell, I'm as up as the next guy for a dumb summer epic with special effects that fire up audiences. But did San Andreas have to be such a monument to stupidity?"
Durgamati does have a lesson or two to impart but the narrative and its storytelling technique is so bland that it slips through the cracks.
"Jungle Fever may be a failure, but it is the kind of failure that engenders hope: It finds Lee refining the skills he already possesses and striking out in encouraging new directions."
"A film that is simply passable, and that personally caused me a triple disappointment. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"The drawback, as Noé veterans will anticipate, is that his style trumps - no, obliterates - the scenario. Climax becomes steadily less thrilling as it approaches its, you know ... peak."
"At the end ... you'll be buried by that big ball of cliches, wondering how the movie squandered its potential, its viewers' faith in the story, and all of its credibility."
"There is a good deal to be said about Peter Jackson's long-awaited and exceedingly long adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit, most of it bad."
"Beatrix Potter's children's books may have been out of copyright since 2014, but that's no excuse for this manure-scented take on her best-known tale."
"Sprawling its intriguing capital in all directions, Interview falls short even in reaching that commonest of denominators: the cinematic puff piece."
"Susanna Nichiarelli's film is as lumberingly sombre as these things tend to get, and even an alert, inquisitive lead performance from Romola Garai can't quite put a spring in its step."
"A Titanic wreck that makes you wonder if anyone was at the helm. The plot's lost in a Bermuda triangle of exhausted-formula, genre-muddle and hackneyed storytelling. Bromance, dark drama, slapstick, and rambling, wanna-be-funny speeches get mixed up."
"This is a film without spark. The frustrations are real, but they are neither terribly entertaining nor enlightening."
Will satisfy those with a fluffy romantic sweet tooth while the rest will likely suffer from indigestion.
"Whoever wins, we snooze."
Superficially engaging but emotionally empty.
"F9 is the first chapter that feels tired, uninspired, lazy and most egregiously of all for a Fast & Furious film, stuck in second gear."
"This is one of those pictures, alas, that is critic-proof merely by dint of the fact that applying any amount of thought to it, superficial, or serious, or what have you, is an entirely humiliating,"
Bruce Campbell provides a hint of carefree wiggle room when the rest of the production is controlled to within an inch of its life.
Penn's pompous indulgence is gruesome and gravely disappointing.
The film feels like a shallow cash grab from the storied studio and it's unfortunate.
"Wrapped up in Tim Allen's new film, Joe Somebody, is a gem of a message. Unfortunately, the packaging isn't as good as the moral."
"What opens as a 21st-century variation on Hudson Hawk (and I mean that as a compliment) soon trades in its gleeful weirdness for a Pineapple Express-style blend of rote action and abrasive, unfunny comedy."
The narrative of [Dirt Music] repeatedly relies on its characters' uncontrollable horniness yet fails to make them seem anything but profoundly unhinged.
"Yikes. Cribbed dialogue from The Empire Strikes Back is this film's only attempt at quality, and even that falls flat."
"Bleed hits every well-trod beat and expectation of the genre, and is such a rote exercise it might as well be called Boxing: The Movie, or Sports Comeback: The True Hollywood Story."
"An idyllic seaside holiday, a bright-eyed ingenue, a cheery retro soundtrack - all incorporated into a big-hearted musical. Sounds familiar?"
"I have always thought of the strip as a quiet cartoon, one based on irony and sly, wry humor. Not so the Garfield movie, which is generally raucous and loud."
The problem is that it goes on and on and on to the point where it becomes repetitive. [Full review in Spanish]
But Stardust conveys no palpable life or dream quality. You're depressingly aware of an overeager special effects lab.
This movie is so toothless that you'll probably pay for your ticket in a paper cup on the side of the road... it's so concerned with keeping everything in line for future movies that it ultimately takes no risks...
"The main characters may be refreshingly cliché-free, but almost everyone they meet in Beverly Hills is a stilted cartoon."
"Estes never seems to find the balance between dark farce and existential drama, and the cast - especially the goofy Maguire - is left trying to sort it all out."
If you loved A Knight's Tale or The Time Machine... rent those instead!
This movie should not be bad.
"Director Frdric Auburtin's movie is a mushy, stakes-free drama that attempts to impress all the conventions of biographical cinema upon a self-impressed overview of business world maneuvering and horse-trading."
Enter Mark David Chapman's mind and prepare to be bored out of yours.
You might expect more with this cast and the titillating subject matter but it is (like some nudes) less interesting when completely revealed.
"This high-concept comedy, about the first person to develop the ability to lie, is wildly uneven but features a few laughs, cameos galore, and an indictment of organized religion that would make Bill Maher proud."
"One of the last lines by Al Pacino in the film is, ""Burn this."" I agree."
"If you want some meaning with your mayhem, or even a good line of dialogue or two, look elsewhere."
The filmmakers don't know what to make of their overblown subject.
"Schumacher's Flatliners is prime material for a remake, being a slick idea that wasn't handled very well in the first place; but alas, this version is a disposable, nonsensical, and instantly forgettable mess that makes the original seem almost masterful."
There's more going on in the sci-fi mystery thriller 'The Signal' than shocking surprises - just not a lot more.
[Brings] absolutely no fresh angles to a time-tested formula that's seemed particularly overworked of late.
"Like an obnoxious relative at a family gathering, Rio 2 grabs you by the arm and insists you're having fun, even when you both know you're not."
"Seeing Johansson lay the smack down all over a futuristic city has a certain appeal, but we've seen her do that before."
"Audiences of the era may have been fascinated to see the inner workings of the upper crust, but these are painfully dull, generic ordeals."
Every truly successful raunchy romantic comedy has at its heart a couple worth rooting for. This one doesn't.
"Considering the ingredients on hand, I should've been demanding seconds rather than settling for mediocrity."
"Watching it didn't feel like getting sucked into a thriller; it felt like being imposed upon, deliberately inconvenienced."
"10,000 B.C. is a movie of woolly mammoths and fuzzy thinking."
"While you know the stakes are high, Call Jane never seems particularly interested in proving it."
So bad it's destined for a box of kitty litter.
"Herbert Marshall very stiff, and Jean Arthur set back after a few recent successes..."
"A silly, disjointed and incomplete narrative makes it nearly impossible to appreciate what could have been an intriguing new supernatural franchise."
Obviously reshot and recut to the point of complete incoherence
Shepard's and Hansen's script is simply not compelling. And it doesn't help that Waterston and Kirby elicit so little chemistry.
"Fresh on the T-Meter, but just barely. It's evident that Forster is out of his element at the helm."
"An incoherent mess covered in sticky, goopy blood without one interesting action scene or fresh stunt."
Some gritty and evocative visual touches are overwhelmed by convoluted plotting in this muddled urban crime thriller.
While Skolimowski and DP Micha&#322; Dymek do utilize some gauzy pov shots&#44; &#8220;EO&#8221; is never wholly interested in the perspective of its central character&#46;
"Eddie Murphy returns to comedic form in Tower Heist but his character, and the movie in general, lose their sense of humor."
"...it's supposed to be mutual attraction, but it feels more like coercion at the start."
You really have to be in the mood to get into The Ten's forced goofiness.
"A movie that desperately wants [Latifah's] hip, her edge and mostly her blackness but doesn't know what to do with the human being who comes with the package."
"The women of the film certainly deserve better, as they're often relegated to the role of victim, harmed or murdered simply to propel the plot along."
"Bloated, misshapen, and rather coldly clinical and inept in the way it tries to be a story about overcoming past trauma."
"A glittery string of backstage conventions. Backstabbing! Pushy parents! Precocious stars! Blind ambition! But if you're a tween (and don't watch Glee), the cliches will be new to you."
"While you can admire the filmmaker for his unconventional means of expressing himself, without any sense of linearity, or character development, it becomes impossible to invest in this picture."
"If another dumb-blonde joke is something you've hoped never to suffer again, make every effort to avoid the protracted punch line that constitutes the bulk of The House Bunny."
"Even with Joseph Fiennes as a visceral, intellectual Martin Luther, the latest bigscreen take on the Christian reformer proceeds like a stultifying history pageant rather than a movie with a pulse of its own."
"Jolie runs as well as any action hero, and totes weapons better than most... But unless Jolie teams with Police Woman's Angie Dickinson and they call the sequel Salt and Pepper, I'm not interested."
Idris Elba is one of the most charismatic and compelling actors working today&#44; and even he couldn&apos;t elevate Beast past its eye-rolling&#44; superficial script&#46;
"Maybe they should call it ""The Do-Overs,"" ""The Remakers"" or simply, ""We're Out of Ideas."""
Never mind blue pills and red pills&#46; The bitterest pill to swallow is the fact that The Matrix Resurrections is okay but it is not The One&#46;
"Something must be done, but it's never clear if Labaki and her fellow screenwriters ... have an idea as to what that something might be."
The problem is that nothing matters. It's just two very attractive people shooting at each other and blowing things up.
Drained bourgeois chill is so 2001.
"Michael Showalter is a funny man, but ... how to put this gently ... not a funny movie star."
"Sadly, Brooks manages to hack it up like he did to poor Robin Hood, thanks to some very stale jokes and overly repetitious gags."
Ichikawa evokes the heady and suffocating effect of the past playing irrevocable catch-up with itself.
Astaire's dancing is just the best.
"It does have some entertainment value, but what is most notable in this movie are all the missed opportunities to make it a better film."
Meandering and unfocused.
"Filled with scenes of gloomy characters confronting their demons or wrestling with insipid moral quandaries, this joyless slog isn't a superhero film so much as it is an excruciating therapy session with huge explosions and guys in capes."
[The actors] stand around mouthing dry as Martian dust dialogue.
"Nicolas-Troyan can handle special effects but his fantasy world looks less enchanting than a sanitary landfill. Everything is gray, flat and blurry."
"Body of Lies is being hailed in some quarters as a 'new' kind of war thriller. While this glitzy production may attract audiences suffering from battle fatigue, it's nothing of the sort."
"While Benigni (who stars and co-wrote) seems to be having a wonderful time, he might be alone in that."
"It's as if the filmmakers lost their nerve when it came time to write the kind of intimate, revealing conversation that can make a sex toy unnecessary."
Dreyfuss tries hard ... and almost saves the whole darn thing.
"It may take a rocket scientist to successfully count cards, but not to wite a smarter script than what 21 delivers."
"The feature doesn't have the twinkle in its eye to accurately blend SuperLincoln with TrueLincoln into a loving, ax-swinging whole."
"For an ostensibly serious movie standing before us with something to preach about God and the people who follow Him, it's surprising how thin its platitudes actually play."
Unsettling but tedious
An earnest also-ran.
There is certainly an attempt or at least a flirtation with some deeper idea but neither the script or direction commit and so what the audience is left with is a rather simplistic and superficial adaptation of Austen's Emma.
"They make a fun duo, but none of the constituent genres work in this overbearing action-rom-com."
"A squalid piece of nonsense that trivializes murder and violence. The color is good and Travolta is a master of the dance floor, but this is nothing more than glitzy trash."
"Mad Money is a comedy caper where the caper's not interesting and the comedy's not funny. Take away those elements and all that's left is a tepid female buddy movie and, like its male counterparts, we've had enough of those to choke a critic."
"Yet another Jet Li-driven, Chinese historical drama is full of sweeping montages, dramatic battle scenes and rhetorical blood oaths, but...its dramatic gravitas is lost among a convoluted plot and a weak love triangle."
"What seems to happen when you watch a movie in near total silence is that you become almost sensory-starved -- a meditative state by definition, I suppose."
"A genre piece is seldom good if it's trying to so aggressively to evoke past texts: It tries hard to be ""Wise Blood,"" but The Devil All The Time is more of an annoying dud."
"Too bad its good intentions only go so far. The compositions are visually flat, and the movie simply isn't very funny"
There's a line in the film referencing the fact that sequels can never measure up to the original and they are right.
It's not clear exactly what kind of movie(s) Widows wants to be: feminist heist thriller? Sprawling political saga? Bare-knuckled gangster noir?
"Unfortunately, the film's occasionally thrilling visual sleight-of-hand comes at the ultimate service of a boilerplate early-mid-life-crisis drama."
"This film is a bit like what what would happen if Timothy Treadwell, the subject of Grizzly Man, directed a film about himself without an assist from Werner Herzog."
"A film that is at best misguided, at worst stubbornly flashy, garbled and ready to file in the drawer labeled 'instantly forgettable.'"
"A colossal, time-wasting flop that is offensive to every fiber of my very being."
"The self-consciousness of identity, in the form of that puppet, inevitably gets in the way of the storytelling."
The characters are so head-scratchingly idiotic you wonder how in the world they managed to put their swimsuits on.
Each of the title characters in this breezy French farce is a bit of an ass&#44; so it&#8217;s difficult to find much sympathy for their navigation of various relationship travails&#46;
"Something interesting could have manifested within The Quiet Ones, but the whole show turns out to be a generic but polished mediocrity."
"In the end, all that 'The Company' really does is make you want to go out and study 'The Red Shoes'."
A hit-and-miss affair.
A sense of duty and a desire to create pretty pictures ... aren't exactly compelling reasons to mount a cinematic adaptation of a celebrated novel.
This is an unmade bed of a movie -- and ambiguous to a fault.
"I'm not dissing the achievements of Paul Potts but this is a formulaic exercise in ""feel good"" cinema that fails to recreate this inspirational tale."
"An indolent and painfully unfunny attempt at comedy with uninspired, forced humor and annoying characters that have zero chemistry."
"The balance of character, plot, irreverent humor and innate decency that made some of the earlier Muppet movies so welcome is lost."
It&#8217;s the kind of film that would epitomize what people think movies that win awards are all about&#46; Were this some 90s effort coming from Miramax&#44; that may have been closer to the truth&#46; As it stands today&#44; all I see is a rundown theater&#46;
More indebted to Ritchie's particular brand of stylistically exhausting action-adventure than to Conan Doyle's elegant prose and intensely intellectual anti-hero.
"While Moretz performs with deadpan relish, the creaking script gives her little funny to say, and satirical jabs at mainstream America proffer little more than jokes about tourists taking selfies."
"My tolerance for zombie acting and zombie drama in the style of Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later is never all that high, and the tropes are a bit familiar here."
"In Okja, a transporting protest fantasy becomes another shrill dust-up in the waging of the culture wars."
"The problem with The Baxter is right there at the center of the movie, and maybe it is unavoidable: Showalter makes too good of a baxter. He deserves to be dumped."
"The movie has a poorly improvised, amateur-night feel."
"Well, I guess this is what happens when a valuable franchise is entrusted to the guys who foisted Your Highness upon an unsuspecting world."
"I'm pretty tired of seeing, especially in indie films, ""nice guys"" with reasonable explanations for doing abusive, criminal things to women."
"A unique filmmaking style that resembles near-documentary realism. If you were not aware that this was a movie, you would think you were watching surveillance footage recorded by a sophisticated private investigation firm."
"The second film as director of Lulu Wang doesn't move me nor does it seem funny, but I can't deny that it contains a certain intimacy with the intercultural treaty that describes the vicissitudes of a Chinese family. [Full review in Spanish]"
"""Spirit Untamed"" takes full advantage of Merced's range and has some finely drawn characters, but the story is rather threadbare."
"It is one weird and difficult film, one that is sure to drive audiences crazy and inspire a whole new round of not-wholly-undeserved frustration towards the director..."
"The Front Runner would seem to be a movie for our times, or at least one that could provide a partial explanation for how we got here. Instead, it's a mostly inert drama that will likely wind up as forgotten as Hart's presidential ambitions."
"Lacks coherence and subtext, failing to trigger either revulsion or fear."
Jeff Feuerzeig isn't skeptical enough of Laura Albert's explanations and rationalizations to reveal any more than she wants us to know.
It's often been said that Simon Pegg would agree to star in absolutely anything: now at least it's official.
"Well, it undoubtedly boasts some amazing visual effects work."
So what's it all about? Got me.
Like Scream remade with butter knives...takes a lazily superficial tack on the old werewolf yarn.
Creepy visuals but no scares in the latest adaptation of King's novel. What should have been a chilling finale is reduced to an almost comical visual that feels trendy as if the directors are aiming for a new series on AMC.
The film is inert and narratively unintelligible.
"""The Goods"" has to imply an antonym as it is far from good. Despite starring the Emmy award winning Jeremy Piven, the writing destroyed any chance of success."
"Themes don't develop so much as they endlessly repeat, nor do they gain much through extended duration. It fails to engage either the intellect or the senses."
Diane Keaton's frequent bouts of hysteria are numbing in this otherwise amiable shaggy dog story.
Epic fantasy artfully directed by James Bobin but lacking the effortlessly odd feel of Tim Burton's work on the first film.
"An intriguing premise and setup quickly dissolves into generic, thriller nonsense. Full review in Spanish"
"At times I wanted the whole film to be ""hollow"". See a matinee."
"Moore (in only his second try at Bond) gets to be extremely unconvincing as a martial artist, though somewhat believable as a frequent escaper."
Ultimately flat. [Full Review in Spanish]
"A would-be dark, self-congratulatory dramedy that lacks both transgressive laughter and honest engagement with its themes of death and teen depression."
"The film's adherence to irony becomes tedious, especially with the supporting characters planting more adult references in almost every conversation."
"While subtleties and pacing are MIA, the filmmakers know how to shoot action and they make the most of it in Act of Valor."
"Matt Tyrnauer's scintillating, gossipy, heavy-handed documentary delves into Cohn's contradictions without much illumination."
The game scenes have little coherence or momentum.
"This film is a clear attempt to create a commercial success that will amuse but seems more focused on becoming a ""gold mine"" and for that reason loses authenticity. [Full review in Spanish]"
Robert Downey Jr. Talks to the animals but doesn't much of anything interesting to say.
"Ok, we get it. Anne needs to stop and smell zee roses. Alas, there is the zee-ro chemistry between her stars."
Proceed directly to the 'S' section of your local video shop and rent Shaun Of The Dead again instead.
This reboot is anything but fantastic. Don't waste your money on this. [Full review in Spanish]
Rarely is a movie audience asked to put up with so much noise for such a thankless payoff as it must with Zathura.
"This narrative splice job simply doesn't hold together. Call it a taut mess or a hot mess, take your pick."
"""Young Adult"" is not a terrible film, just one that was not thought out very well."
"Uncharted is fine, and entertaining enough, but while some moments are inspired, others are completely inert. Its oddly neutered and bloodless, the stakes negligible."
"It's tough to watch such a glum progression through the familiar, with bits of quirk dissected and bandied about."
"Unaccountably a box-office sensation, this plodding and distasteful horror melodrama from Britain has only a few really eerie moments."
"It's engaging enough while one is watching it, but not distinctive enough to make it special, or, in this case, enthusiastically recommendable."
"The film's honeyed cinematography and gruff stylings mean it often looks the part, but it moves too hurriedly, failing to conjure the atmosphere or majesty of the best of the genre."
The actors are game but the hijinks are too stilted and tame by today's standards.
Bland and predictable.
The not-a-prequel tactic is a failed smoke screen since its strength is the connection to the beginning of a universe. Eliminate it and you are left with just another muddled creature feature with ideas more grandiose than the writers exploring them.
"an awfully rickety, hollow exercise in style over substance"
"The movie has more flawed logic, lame coincidences and plot holes than the average cell phone has ring tones."
That short-changing of political intrigue for shallow relationship melodrama is the film's ultimate downfall.
"It's not a dreadful watch; you'll likely stay on the couch to see what happens to the next person who swallows a pill. It is, however, a disappointment."
"Morris, who co-authored the screenplay with Jesse Armstrong, has transformed these fascinating yarns into the first out-and-out dud of his career."
Not even a choice ass-whupping can make up for the plodding familiarity that precedes it.
"For all the film's gritty verisimilitude, The Messenger is not the great Iraq War movie that Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker is."
"Mopey, po-faced rubbish."
"Ballistic is all over the map, a series of overwrought-yet -underachieving action set pieces punctuated by a muddled story line."
"An odd mix of warm family film, bleak drama and public service broadcast. (Even my pet-loving 7 year old, presumably its target audience, declared it ""too sad"".)"
A Charles Bronson vehicle that hardly ranks among his best&#46;
"There is such striking, discomforting imagery here, but it's employed, unfortunately, for a story that never quite decides what it wants to be."
Watching The Amityville Horror is about as enjoyable as attending a Halloween party hosted by people you can barely tolerate.
"The rather unoriginal satiric flaw becomes obvious, in most cases, within 30 seconds, the film has little to do but repeat the same giant bull's eye gags over and over again."
Well meaning but paint-by-numbers disaster movie shortchanges the really interesting story behind the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster and its consequences.
"Norbit may be the most disturbing, morally repugnant, nightmare-inducing film of the century so far."
"Most folks, when asked about the legend of King Arthur, don't immediately conjure up an image of Keira Knightley in a leather bikini."
Here Shakespeare definitely loses out. Okay if Welles had something else to substitute. But he doesn't.
"... establishes some intriguing character dynamics, yet as a broader examination of the immigrant experience, it lacks the depth and nuance to make an impact."
"To its credit, the film gets at the things that gave the Airmen their lasting fame -- the odds and racism they overcame, leading to the integration of the armed forces, the civil rights movement and the integration of America."
"C'mon, it's the millennium, it's the electronic age, where soldiers everywhere fight with one finger on the trigger of their gun and the other on the send button of their cell phone."
"What is it with Robin Williams playing creepy roles? How did the one-time funniest guy on earth turn into Mr. Spooky? Come back, Mork, your work here was not done."
"Take a hot young actor, surround him with jazz music and cigarette smoke, maybe a little mahogany, and stir. It's a Muppet Babies approach to onscreen literary iconography that was already a trope before Rebel In The Rye came along."
"Kids are too smart to fall for it, and any grown-up who thinks that ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" is funny or heartwarming has a head made out of cabbage."
"A handful of acting moments aside, ""Being Flynn"" is a drama without much in the way of rewards."
"Because the film never really brings to life its inner secrets, it seems leisurely, and toward the end, it seems long."
It's admirably to-the-point but lacking a certain verve.
"Mackie is generally fun to watch but finds little support from Idris, whose acting is so devoid of emotion that one half expects a big twist reveal that he too is a machine."
...so much of what happens feels so predictable and cliché that its ideas can ultimately feel a bit shallow.
the film's rote nature and its complete lack of the kind of self-aware trashy thrills and humor we might expect from a good Renny Harlin flick (or even Ellis's immortal Snakes on a Plane) drain it of energy and fun.
Southbound is yet another contemporary horror film that belongs to seemingly every era but its own.
"Even if it doesn't quite fulfill its potential, Miss Bala is interesting enough to make it worth at least a DVD or VOD rental."
"It finally occurred to me that pyrotechnics are Bay's pornography: massive, fiery money-shots. I hope he had a sufficient supply of tissues in the editing room."
"Nick Cannon is a funny guy. Not only that, he's got talent and charisma. He deserves to be in a film that doesn't try its best to make him look bad."
"There's just water, water everywhere - and no one stops to think."
"Achingly long and pointless, Runs is a movie about family that's dishonest in its presentation of every relationship."
"This In-Laws isn't a disaster, it's just not very good."
"Robin and Marian are played by a scowling Russell Crowe and a grim Cate Blanchett, who has the face of a wooden squaw stained by decades of cigar smoke. I can't remember a more un-fun-looking couple."
"The actresses, notably Fonda, are fine, but the characters are a collection of clichés and behaviors that feel as patently false as the generic town built around them."
There's not terribly much more going on in this movie than the physical movement itself.
"Director George Tillman Jr keeps revving it up, but this just gets tangled and boring."
"There was a surplus of plot twists, double crosses... It left me cold."
I don't want to hear Memory again for a very long time. Miaow!
"For all of the star power on display, this is an indoor Cats: spayed, defanged and thoroughly domesticated."
Displays some decent visual gimmickry but shoots for mystical and epic but ultimately feels laboured and pointless.
"I still prefer the Phoenix Saga from the 90s cartoon. I thought 'Dark Phoenix' might be better or at least as good, but sadly, that isn't the case. [Full review in Spanish]"
"If the scenery is glorious, any emotional resonance is undermined by how annoying it all is, while the premise is so far out of the reach of almost anyone in their early twenties, it's basically offensive."
Sandra Bullock give it that old college try but the movie still flops
"""The Kings of Summer"" boasts some of the deadpan melancholy one associates with Wes Anderson's best work, but it doesn't have quite the same bite or insight."
"Even with a decent director at the helm, The Twilight Saga always will be hampered by Meyer's juvenile prose"
"Mostly, characters simply reference penises, breasts or pot and wait for laughs. There's rarely a punch line, just an acknowledgement that penises, breasts and pot exist."
"While it's occasionally funny, Three Amigos! isn't an entirely fun occasion."
"Mean-spirited, gloomy and ineptly made by the Brothers Strause, who here find themselves promoted from special-effects experts to filmmakers (in name at least)."
"An inconsistent, flat film that is too often reliant on jump scares instead of atmosphere."
I'd feel fine endorsing it if you could see it for free.
"While the canine performances are impeccable in A Dog's Purpose, this family movie is more of a dog's breakfast in terms of construction and tone."
"Joe Dante has gifted the world great cinematic treats, such as creature feature Gremlins, sci-fi comedy adventure Innerspace, and the love letter to the cinema, Matinee. Alas, Burying the Ex will not be thought of with such reverence in the future."
"There is a chance I have simply outgrown Alvin, Simon and Theodore. But I can still recognize a quality film and this isn't it."
"Viewing it today, its quaintness and timidness make it seem out of step with the even more insidious contemporary times."
"This sour Moses - whose visions come after a biff on the head - emerges as a certifiable lunatic who gets lucky with a few meteorological, geographical and zoological anomalies."
"It is two people in a bar, three or four beers in, just telling jokes to each other that are not even funny."
"A dreary, droning film."
"The only tension here is if Newcombe will follow in the footsteps of his band's namesake, Rolling Stones' multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, and OD."
In which director Michael Bay perpetrates another junkyard fiasco that turns the volume up to 11 and the IQ to -1.
Watching films whose characters spend much of their time staring at computer screens or waking up from dreams is a bit of a drag.
A science-fiction love story set in a world that is visually sheened to evocative perfection - but in which the central premise is creakingly old hat.
"One of the talking heads that Cool It drops on the unsuspecting viewer notes with the slightly condescending chuckle of the large-brained that Gore's film, An Inconvenient Truth, was a ""great piece of propaganda."" No doubt it was. So is this."
"What begins as a gritty, documentary-style dive into the young women's world -- they're introduced as looters during the 2011 Tottenham riots -- quickly devolves into a Lifetime movie."
"It's time to stop, I'm afraid."
"This may be bordering on lightning bolt worthy, but... If the devil made them remake this movie, at least he could have given them a better script."
Garner's next revenge mission should be taking out whoever convinced her this was a good idea.
"Doris Day will be 89 in two weeks, which makes her exactly half a century too old to play the lead in Admission. That's a pity, as perhaps only she could have done it justice -- if it had been made in 1958."
Despite the film&apos;s flaws&#44; Empire of Light is a reminder that the cinema was here before us and it will be here after us&#44; no matter what streaming services have to say about the conversation&#46;
"Robert Downey Sr directs this overly self-consciously ""wacky"" day-in-the-life comedy. Unfortunately, even with plenty of talent attached, the film goes nowhere."
"A desert-set men-on-a-mission movie complete with jabbering jihadis, macho hysteria and the occasional extraterrestrial waving its tentacles in the background as if to say: 'Isn't this supposed to be about me?'"
Charming performances and the naivete of the characters go a long way toward smoothing over the characters' perpetuation of class distinctions and patronizing attitudes.
"There is no reason for this sequel to the already-pointless 1996 live action remake of the classic Disney cartoon to exist, and the filmmakers fail to come up with any convincing pretense of justification."
Don&apos;t Worry Darling is an example of a great actress doing superior work in a movie that doesn&apos;t deserve her&#46;
As James Lipton might have said&#44; &#8220;Sharks are scary&#46; SHOW us that you know this&#33;&#8221;
Keillor has managed to tamper with his homegrown formula in ways that will put the casual viewer to sleep and perhaps confuse his fervent fanbase to a point of complete disinterest.
"Barely intermittent, reminding us that the B-movie is still very much with us."
"It's nothing special, and by that I mean the voice work, story, production value, and overall aesthetic could have been borrowed from forty other kids-only films."
The film allows Puss in Boots time to shine&#46; But far too many characters and a lack of heart prevent The Last Wish from reaching its full potential&#46; &#10;&#10;
Vacillates uncertainly between unfunny farce and ineffectual melodrama.
&#8230;Wakanda Forever may well have fans&#44; but it&#8217;s hard to imagine anyone who could prefer this bloated&#44; confusing film to the far more effective original&#8230;&#46;
"Love talking animal movies, but even the charismatic Robert Downey, Jr. can't save this film from cinema oblivion. Doolittle loses the charm of the franchise which made audiences fall in love in the first place"
"This, as you've doubtless guessed, is all quite silly. And occasionally charming, too, in its wilfully old-fashioned way."
A remake of a Dutch movie that itself wasn't much of a success.
"IT Chapter Two has flickers of fright, but is ultimately undone by an arduous runtime. The scares that work are overpowered by big-budget CGI theatrics."
"The film is like an installment of True Crime Stories hosted by Perez Hilton. Yes, it's all that."
"Glass feels like fan service that tries too hard to replicate earlier success, and manages to diminish both Unbreakable and Split in retrospect."
"While I'll concede that the film has its moments stylistically, it is still a rather pointless journey into an already tiresome genre."
Pretty Maids All in a Row is the first American film for French director Roger Vadim. If we are lucky it may be his last.
A painfully derivative movie that exhibits all the worst characteristics of sequels.
The movie's minimalism -- which gives the eerie impression that Destination Wedding was better intended as a short story or a play rather than a feature film -- might have succeeded if it weren't for the script itself.
&quot;There is a very interesting concept behind this one&#46;&#46;&#46; but it didn&apos;t work for me&#46;&quot;
"I'd see Tina Fey and Paul Rudd in anything, but this is pushing it. Admission is so slight that a breeze could flatten it."
"There isn't even, really, any point. There is, however, throw-up, poo, pee and lots of running around and screaming."
Novice filmmaker Markus Blunder just lets the violence snowball all the way down a slippery slope.
"Alice doesn’t seem to be in on its own joke. Well enough made technically but increasingly ridiculous, it takes itself all too seriously."
"The Garden does a fine job of promoting the power of grassroots advocacy; in almost all other respects, however, this is nonfiction filmmaking that's nearly as dull as dirt."
This one is as predictable as sunrise and as stale as bedpost gum.
Phil Spector doesn't give us much to talk about or applaud.
A Civil War rebellion becomes an enervating movie by Gary Ross.

"While this film tries to combine the two, its weak and uninspired script undermines the effort."
... a handsomely mounted period piece that emphasizes lavish visual gimmicks at the expense of emotional depth.
"Has stylish production values and a somewhat creepy performance by the talented Frank Langella, but it's often too lazily constructed, unimaginative and lacking much-needed suspense."
Surprisingly lacking in primal impact.
"If the composer's shade could hear the words this script has put in his mouth it really would be a case of ""roll over, Beethoven"", right there in his grave."
"By the time the end credits hit, there's joy emerging not from the outcome of the Genevieve/Greg romantic tango, but the feeling of relief to know the film, and Vardalos's insipid direction, has finally come to a close."
"Takeshi Miike's original 2003 One Missed Call was second-rate techno-phobic J-horror tripe, meaning that Eric Valette's even lousier American remake is something like the next generation of suck."
"A psychological thriller, elegantly filmed, with a dream location worthy of a romantic comedy and good performances but collapses when the script takes to the ground of the ridiculous. [Full review in Spanish]"
The biggest waste is Cage: a brief spot of shit-losing would've gone a long way to elevating this forgettable thriller.
"There are some funny lines and a smattering of semi-clever plot twists. But mostly, the movie is stale and sloppy."
"This 1975 feature is slick and often funny, but the smugness of the satire and the stunted emotions are finally wearying."
An exercise in series continuation that struggles to conjure up any chapter-specific intrigue.
"Mediocrity, thy name is Justice League."
A very dreamlike experience (especially if you fall asleep while you're watching it).
... hints at a grander finished product if more time and money had been available.
Someone give these folks a real budget so they can make a movie that looks as good as it sounds.
I guess we've arrived at the point where even movie titles are dogwhistles?
"It's a comedy filled with non-star actors, a sloppy story and misfired humor."
Just doesn't have the mettle to turn this tale of British resourcefulness into a fully-fledged feature.
"While Talalay and her writers have dreamed up a number of fairly imaginative ways to show the hazards of household machines and gadgets, their horror effort offers few truly scary moments and not a few ridiculous ones."
"Despite all the money spent on it, it still looks cheap."
Mean spirited and very distinctly inept to the definition of self-love.
"Spread's strength lies in its dark, comic undertones but alas, its third act collapses into sentimentality."
"This chamber-horror oddity from the English actress-turned-auteur is too weird, too wonky; intermittently gross, and often gruelling."
"It's a nice change of pace to find a sequel that doesn't merely try to remake the original, but Babe: Pig in the City lacks any of the original's endearing gentle spirit."
There's something sad about seeing a character as sweet and simple as good ol' Charlie Brown so totally ruined.
"Playground Dad is one of those best friends that rom-com leads tend to have, except that he doesn't have a name or even much of a friendship with this film's bland and beleaguered lead."
"This movie is actually worse than the post-production 3D, which is enough to give 3D a bad name."
"The first It brought a robust blockbuster maximalism to the horror genre, and the sequel, like many blockbuster franchises, starts to list from all the baggage."
The trauma in Scream VI is mostly convincing due to the performances&#46; However&#44; problems don&#8217;t arise once this has to become a slasher movie&#44; but how it becomes one and how it&#8217;s intertwined with the rest of the franchise
Every scare is telegraphed. Every surprise is recycled from a better thriller. Even the devil would send this one back.
"Although the material is lightweight, it is a cute, amusing film."
"A deformed composite of every buddy comedy ever made, sliced and diced to the point of total anonymity. The characters aren't buddies and the premise isn't comedic."
"Smokin' Aces is Tarantino lite -- a vague and unsuccessful attempt to bring together a bunch of offbeat, unrelated characters in a situation where a bloody resolution is inescapable."
The next-level low brow humor in The Brothers Grimsby makes Adam Sandler's worst film look like a Stanley Kubrick production.
"The [film's] conclusion might be that tragedies deserve sympathy, not judgement...and I wish I could come to this conclusion myself but I saw a film directed by Tom Hooper."
"This slapdash cinematic lark feels like a holdover from another era, lost in a time capsule of style and perspective."
What the [public school] system and its culturally underfunded student body probably don't need is inspired-by-true-events claptrap like Take the Lead.
"What's perhaps most off-putting about the movie isn't its increasingly stale humor, but the way it ultimately validates its characters' worst impulses."
"The movie isn't about much of anything, which you will find out if you can manage to stay awake."
Very little new here.
Some of the chintziest and most uninspired exploitation cinema this side of &quot;Sharknado&#46;&quot;
John Hillcoat's heist flick brings an embarrassment of acting riches to bear on a laughably disjointed script that can't decide whether to go for self-seriousness or self-parody.
"The 3D effects of explosions and plane crashes are plentiful and impressive; the one-dimensional storytelling and stiff subtitles, rather less so."
"It's with strange awe that you realise, halfway through the legal thriller Misconduct, that it may actually be the worst film either Anthony Hopkins or Al Pacino have ever starred in."
A basic enough slasher. [Full review in Spanish]
Right-wing political comedy just isn't funny.
"What we end up with here is the most pointless remake since Gus Van Sant made his shot-for-shot remake of ""Psycho"" back in 1998."
"Splatter-heavy, self-congratulatory horror-comedy in a ""whoa-dude"" mode that aspires to Ghostbusters or Shaun of the Dead, where evil oozes off the internet via a Pokémon-style game that captures snaps of demons."
"The pace was breakneck in Sheridan's previous thrillers, but in this whodunit the mood is more ruminative and the dialogue is portentous."
"It's not good enough for an audience that doesn't know anything about Douglas Adams, and it's most certainly not good enough for an audience that does."
"As long as all easily offended souls stay away from Clerks II, everyone ought to be happy."
"What is said to be a 'celebration of humanity' lacks just that, using flair and manipulation instead."
A beautiful travelogue and a squandered opportunity.
"At Any Price has an interesting story at its core, but it's bogged down by undeveloped characters and sideplots, as well as a poorly-written third act."
"The movie is full of nonsensical plot twists, embarrassingly broad performances and unappealing characters."
The genre has never felt so small and streaming-friendly as it does in this tawdry misadventure.
Peninsula is a rather large cinematic disappointment in a year when the bar for entertainment is painfully low.
Offers absolutely nothing I hadn't already seen.
"Rumor Has It . . . never ends up finding the right direction, in the process wasting an excellent cast -- particularly Costner and Ruffalo -- and a great premise."
A tonal mess with weak comic timing.
Styled as a film noir -- possibly because the shoestring budget precluded adequate lighting -- the movie guides us through the events leading up to Mr. DeLay's indictment for illegal use of campaign contributions in the 2002 Texas Legislature elections.
"There is some humor in the plot, effective action and scenes that entertain us because of how stupidly the characters behave."
What's the point of creating such defiantly unlikable characters if you're just going to declaw them and give them hearts of gold before the closing credits roll? A better title might have been Girls Gone Mild.
"Elijah Wood, Rose Leslie, Michael Caine and Diesel are all wasted -- and so is our time."
"The bigger issue is that Schumer's performance feels uneven and not all that different between her ""before injury"" and ""after injury"" characters."
"Whether or not the world needs another Tarzan of any kind, it's fairly clear that it didn't need this one."
Everybody's trying really hard to be funny. It's exhausting and kind of irritating.
"Grim, monotonous, and rather facile, though Richard Burton's aging agent has some honest poignancy."
"Arquette, who is better in small doses, has just a little too much screen time here."
No one presumes to apply artistic criteria to the sight of a high-rise being demolished. Why should Transformers be any different?
A potentially extraordinary film drowned in a cloying soup of mediocrity.
A disappointing and nonsensical remake...
"Attempting to tap into the public's collective fears and suspicions comes D.J. Caruso's preposterous Eagle Eye, an action film with plenty of thrills but I have no idea what alternate reality it's set in."
It just keeps meandering and meandering.
"Billy Crystal and Bette Midler class it up as much as they can. It's just such a shame ""Parental Guidance"" is otherwise so darn dumb."
"[A] screamingly awful, achingly unfunny comedy..."
[T]he drama and the bigger picture feel as emotionally constrained as the characters' physical confinement.
The Nun runs into a lot of the same problems that 2014's Annabelle did. The build up to these characters seemed more terrifying than what they were given in their actual movies.

O'Connor shamelessly lays on the schmaltz and cliches.
"Those seeking depth, character traits serving a purpose, and a reason for the characters' motivations will be left sorely disappointed."
"The hopeful ending comes off as too little, too late. Wahlberg gives the role his all, but sticking with him is a futile gesture. The Gambler never pays off. It's a sucker's bet."
This pitiful would-be-sleazy melodrama is so terrible it can't even manage to be cheesy.
The production lacks depth in favor of its conventional approach to a historical biography and the dutiful veneration of its subject&#46;
Rigged for your pleasure...everything is played up for schmaltz value or dopey laughs.
Mistress of Evil makes a conscious decision to address a subject that not many family films would touch with a ten-foot pole...then bungles the implications and the message.
"I must admit it's refreshing to see a plus-size woman not only nab the promotion and the hunky guy, but throw it all away within the first 15 minutes. Unfortunately, my plaudits for ""Falling for Figaro"" mostly end there."

"[Welles] hurls restraint to the winds and when he is through with it, his poor little story is reduced to a dramatic pulp."
"Jugjugg Jeeyo’s apologetic feminism aims to cater to both feminists and conservatives. As a consequence, it is neither here nor there and may as well be nowhere."
"We've been down this hellish road so many times that, when the movie culminates in a solemn but goofy black mass, we chuckle rather than shudder."
Overly cute and overconvinced of its own cool.
"Watching Minions is like watching a spastic colon spew little yellow turds at you. It's less a movie than a brand strategy meeting, all the way through."
It's a collage of half-measures.
It deserves a court-martial for taking such a promising premise and grinding it into mediocrity.
I&#8217;m actually upset about how little the movie even tried to escape inveterate clumsiness&#46;
"Writer-director James Ponsoldt's film treats big subjects -- loneliness, coming-of-age and father-son relationships -- with such half-baked conviction, it's a wonder the screen doesn't redden with embarrassment."
Mike Judge can't quite recapture the Office Space magic.
"John Milius' 1984 original may not have been a paragon of clear-headed foreign policy, but...Dan Bradley's remake predictably sidesteps-and, in one case, mocks-its source material's most interesting moments..."
A stupid celebrity revenge film that should never have been made.
Don't expect Layer Cake to add any new layers to the overstuffed genre of British gangster movies.
We Broke Up isn't a horrible film as much as it's a disappointing one.

"Strange Wilderness offers little in the way of laughs or depth, but if low-brow comedy is your niche, then you could do a lot worse."
Relies on energetic chemistry between Knightley and Fiennes but its much ado about nothing.
If it had a livelier pace and more believable acting by secondary characters ... Where's Marlowe? would be a big treat for audiences seeking a hip comedy.
"With every improvement, some magic is lost. In ""Secret in Their Eyes,"" we get a story that has been improved almost to the point of nonexistence."
[T]here's another side of this conflict that isn't provided a chance to offer its side of the story.
"Compelling enough that one wishes to be able to see the entire eight hours, with all the missing context filled back in. As it is, this short version seems even longer than eight hours."
"When I prayed to the film divinities that I wanted less Tom Hanks at the movies, I didn't just mean that I wanted him to be thinner."
There's simply not much that can be said about a film that aims low and still manages to miss its mark.
[Plays] like something even John Hughes would have left in the drawer.
"If you took everything I dislike about indie filmmaking, packed it all into one tube, and gave it a good squeeze, something like Year of the Dog would shoot out."
"It has the unmistakable hollowed-out, jerkily-paced feel that comes when scenes have been ripped out more for reasons of running time than narrative clarity."
"While Conn's story is inherently compelling, it's pretty much ruined in the telling thanks to her unnerving choice to fill it with a twinkling piano-heavy score, florid narration, and trembling slow-motion."
"Watchmen the movie provides ample evidence that more is more, but less might have been closer to Moore in spirit (that is, anarchic, witty and compelling)."
It's hard to mourn the demise of a franchise that was never more than half-alive to begin with.
"The concept isn't the problem here, it's the execution. Never campy enough to qualify as a guilty pleasure or consistently scary enough to work as pure horror."
"""Towards the end, the film ends up falling apart in its eagerness to surprise the spectator only for the sake of surprising him""."
Fox gets most of the screen time but has the misfortune to be acting opposite Tommy Lee Jones as the preening and crafty MacArthur. Jones's line readings are like Sinatra's phrasing: always surprising yet always apt.
"Turns out Transformers: Age of Extinction actually lives up to its title and chronicles not just the death of our bond with the Autobots, but the death of cinema, and that once-fearsome T. rex called American culture."
[Garrett Hedlund's] performance is 70 percent just him swaying back and forth. I never found him to be at all convincing.
"At a time when bigger is automatically assumed to mean better at the cinema, these con artists hope that going small is the path to a big payoff"
The typically moronic plot simply gets in the way of what might have been a super-ambitious sneaker commercial.
Blood pours from every orifice in what looks like a terrible waste of Smucker's raspberry sauce.
"For the first 10 minutes, RV is an awesome movie. After that, you'll wish you were watching it at home on DVD, so you could take it out of the player and whip it like a frisbee across the room"
"...his new FBI name is Corky Pissant, pronounced just the way it sounds, and the rest of the humor in the movie doesn't get any better."
"As well-versed as [Moorhead and Benson] may be in the sci-fi lexicon, they now need to begin weaving an original vision that takes their knowledge to higher levels, transcending their derivative qualities rather than capitulating to them."
"Lemmon turns in showy, theatrical work that's appropriate to the not-terribly subtle film around him, but the whole enterprise is one that's best avoided..."
"Alas, it's a throwback that's thrown its back out - limping along, trailed by battalions of stereotypes and ammo rounds of cliche."
"Not so f-ant-astic, then, just a little ant-iclimatic."
"The biggest problem with ""Our Brand is Crisis"" is that it's stuck in the limbo between being a serious political drama and a mainstream studio effort."
Making the audience wish they were seeing an old Hulk Hogan movie is simply sad.
Kingdom of Heaven has little going for it outside of its lavish and gory battle sequences.
Accentuates the positive
The kind of comedy that takes the fun out of stupidity.
"""Third Person"" maddens far more than it intrigues. Indeed, more curious than anything about the movie itself is how such an artistic stumble happened."
The commentary becomes muddled as Gaztelu-Urruita frequently gets lost in violent excess.
"As the ending credits went up, I realized that I had never laughed. A few smiles, but that was it."
"Never satisfyingly kooky, spooky or ooky, the new animated ""Addams Family"" film transports Charles Addams' lovably macabre clan into the 21st century, resulting in an undistinguished children's comedy."
Arguably the worst remake since Oldboy.
"Routine, somewhat distended development blunts impact of this British-made programmer."
The picture's hopelessly uninvolving feel is especially disappointing given Bullock and Kidman's typically charismatic work...
Now the big question is pretty simple: was David Seltzer's screenplay any better than Dan McDermott's? The answer is for the most part no.
This idea was a shallow well when it first started; three trips to it has basically emptied all the water out.
"Much like a child going through puberty, the maturation of the Harry Potter franchise has yielded awkward growing pains for the third film in the series."
"Though mildly involving, the feature film suffers from having too few distinctions among its different parts."
"Remains trapped in its own origin., [Full review in Spanish]"
Here's the bottom line: Would people be singing the praises of this film if it was equally well-made but was the story of Mohamed Atta? A terrorist is a terrorist.
"Even allowing that the shortcomings of tactfulness are partly what it's about, the film's own tactfulness feels vaguely unsatisfying."
"Never rises above ""vaguely unsettling."""
"Failing to deliver as a suspenser, The Gift relies heavily on its name cast, particularly Cate Blanchette, which elevates the old-fashioned yarn to a more serious patina."
"At no point is it clear if the movie is a takedown of vest-wearing, MAGA-minded rednecks, or if its actually satirising the brunch-loving, environmentally conscious millennial protagonists."
"Stone's purring, snarling, bedroom kink is embarrassing."
Are there legions of middle-aged weightlifting nuts out there who yearn for the good old days of Chuck Norris mowing down foreign Johnnies with an uzi 9mm?
"As is standard practice, the sequel packs in more, but that extra weight is like an overloaded diver's belt pulling the enterprise down into the depths."
"neither Walker nor the script can keep your interest for the duration, with action set pieces and intrusive music overpowering what should have been a claustrophobic and tense experience"
"An onslaught of bad action set pieces, noticeable editing that doesn't allow any of its laughable dialogue to land, and a brand of pop feminism that tries to be about ""girl power"" without ever exploring the woman at its core"
Too formlessly turgid.
"Big and bouncy, Kung Fu Panda is another powerhouse Family Entertainment that means to pummel its young viewers into adulation."
A wasted opportunity.
"As written and portrayed by Paige, his protagonist comes across a lot less like an oddball, misunderstood naif than he does an irritatingly self-absorbed loser with some serious boundary issues."
"If the Underworld franchise was ever any good, that era has long since past."
Yet another been-there-done-that horror pic.
It would be ripe territory for self-reflection if this sloppy debut from filmmaker Anne Renton weren't plagued with as much self-doubt and uncertainty as its lead Catholic.
The movie flounders around in all directions.
"Contains dialogue so nasty and stupid, you'd swear (right along with the characters) that the booker for Jerry Springer wrote it (Zombie did)."
"The filmmakers are so deadly earnest about the power of music and love and all that stuff, you just twiddle your thumbs waiting for the inevitable."
"Blackhat plays like a parody of a Michael Mann movie, which is depressing, given that it IS a Michael Mann movie."
Holds back no sentimental flourishes in its portrayal of the emotionally fraught relationships of an Indian doctor's family.
One can languish in the strumming of melancholy inspiring folk music only for so long before this feels like a crutch that takes the place of material lacking in the narrative.
"Offers a relentless form of entertainment, never letting up in its approach. However that's not to say it's always easy to comprehend, for the narrative takes a myriad of twists and turns and remains convoluted in its execution."
"Fast & Furious is exactly and precisely what you'd expect. Nothing more, unfortunately."
Parental Content Review
Credit The Front Runner for wading into these deep waters of purity-testing and trolls. Should probably have learned how to swim first.
"This is just a nihilistic, scuzzy movie, and not it's not even nihilistic or scuzzy in an interesting way."
"Every aspect of this computer-animated movie directed by Kelly Asbury seems equally overdetermined and tossed-off, as if it were a caffeinated weekend project for everyone involved."
"""There's more to you than meets the eye, Chuck Wepner,"" says Linda (Naomi Watts), a Jersey bartender who will eventually become his second wife. ""Not much, but just enough,"" she says, and the same might be said of Chuck itself."
Rock's so-so temptation comedy earns its R rating.
Just as tepid and surface-level as Simon Birch was.
"Old Jerusalem isn't often glimpsed on the big screen, though it's a shame that, in this case, it simply serves as the backdrop to some rampaging CGI demons and half-baked theology about the gates of hell."
"This is an American-made narrative, and though Heineman harbors some measure of critical intent toward our government and its rash decision-making, he still takes their line at face value."
"The end of The Girl on the Train doesn't justify the means of The Girl on the Train, a testing two hours of meandering miserablism that ends with a hardy ""hell yeah."""
It's an unfortunate waste of talent all round.
"""The Highwaymen"" is built to play off the chemistry of Costner and Harrelson, but the pair lacks flair, and settle too easily into cranky buddy cop clichés."
"It's a tired opinion, but Seth MacFarlane really does only appeal to fans of Seth MacFarlane... of which, I imagine the number one fan is Seth MacFarlane."
"The movie bing-bing-bings all over the place, repurposing fantasy novels, video games, Arthurian legends. Besson's grocery bill for all I know. Even the musical score has multiple-personality disorder."
Synthetic and rather bland--more like 'Brown NutraSweet.'
"What begins as a would-be exercise in camp devolves into perfervid tosh and ultimately tedium in The Dressmaker, a belligerently over-the-top revenge drama that might just about have squeaked by as an opera."
"... a frustrating puzzle that leaves few clues, but at least the performances are solid and the repetitive structure is redeemed somewhat with a clever ending."
"Kids may crack up, but adults are more likely to spend their time pondering why the popcorn is so pricey."
"If you've been waiting desperately for a lesbian Fatal Attraction that manages to be simultaneously slick and tawdry, your wish has finally been granted."
Slick but uneven romantic comedy.
"Despite its promising pedigree, Cheri doesn't ever find its way."
If only the film itself were worthy of Moore's work.
"The narcoleptic, resigned tone that dominates The Myth of the American Sleepover doesn't make us regret what we've lost. It mostly implies that being young is a major bummer."
"Stone's own presence as a director is oppressive. It's as if he's phoning it in from O'Brian's video-call system, with big, obvious touches that might be confused with mastery."
If my Johnson Rod had ink it could craft a picture flipbook better than this.
"As usual with romantic comedies, the premise keeping these two apart grows tired by the second half and absolutely limp by the conclusion."
"For all its apparent progressive intentions, this revamp has a similar whiff of the 90s about it."
Don Verdean may only appeal to hardcore Hess fans-anyone else will likely never once crack even a smile.
The result is a film that is terribly one-sided and in many ways off-putting despite the promise to provoke debate.
"I struggled to engage with the archetypes contained within the images, even with all that meticulously restored golden-yellow sand."
"Moronic, racist, embarrassing."
"the world of the film is so narrow that pre-occupation Japan looks like a feudal Disneyland, where everybody knew their place and the cherry blossoms were always falling"
"The movie builds atmosphere at the expense of action, buildup at the expense of payoff."
"Affleck's most square-jawed and least successful filmmaking foray, a period saga of such ungainly narrative earnestness that even its most exciting sequences are blunted by the cumbersome drag of their connective tissue"
"We've got a movie about a futuristic city that doesn't spend much time in the futuristic city, instead focusing on a road trip/chase plot line with mostly uninteresting characters."
Cherish is one of those movies in which the soundtrack is better than the movie itself.
"Its overhaul of vampire terror with certain erotic registers leaves me as cold as a corpse, in a state of perpetual apathy. [Full review in Spanish]"
An intimate but heavy-handed family drama about family dysfunction in America's heartland.
"Though avoiding the pitfalls of many safe-bet sequels, it stands as a rather inconsequential bridge between two films."
"[It] clocks in at a bloated 118 minutes. There is not, I promise you, 118 minutes worth of vital plot, special effects or comic business in this movie."
The shallowness of female pop culture that Holofcener courageously tears down is just the thing Just My Luck successfully re-perpetuate.
"Exceeded my very low expectations...Despite the dry spells between genuine laughs, the movie feels over and done with, but doesn't really leave you wanting more. It's just right, and just a little flat."
Re-imagining a character whose appeal is largely inextricable from his initial era is a suicide mission&#46; Stay too pure to the original &amp; what&#8217;s the point&#63; Complications stray from its strengths&#46; It&apos;s basically a question of who would fall on the grenade&#46; 
"Neophytes may be left in the dust for lack of narrative connections and clarifications, while Pullman admirers of all stripes may feel short-changed on mood and atmosphere."
"It's just surprising that a film called ""Labyrinth of Lies"" would be so straightforward and predictable."
"It's a movie of two minds, and they never meet."
"Groundbreaking elements, but violent X-Men tale falls short."
"I laughed a couple of times, but mostly I was bored out of my mind and not a little depressed."
Missing is a sense of the interior life behind the smiling face that Selena showed the world. What of the drive that led her to music? What comfort did she find in it? What pain?
Apparently Sean Penn was cut from this film. Lucky him.
"Sometimes, history doesn't have to repeat itself."
"When attempting to make a movie about a prize nincompoop then it helps if you aren't even more conspicuously dim than your protagonist. Yet on the evidence of The Pink Panther 2, it looks as though there were bumbling nitwits on both sides of the camera."
"There's a sense that this isn't the film Walter expected to make, but given the footage he had he pieced together a movie. Yet in the end, the question remains: Amityville hoax or horror?"
A film that is wall-to-wall idiocy.
"It's aimed squarely at primary schoolers, but they'll probably get fidgety before its 111 minutes elapse."
"The film tinkles on affably, never quite sure of its focus but civilised, gentle, prettily-mannered."
Chéri's saga of bad parenting ostensibly has to do with designs and rituals of love.
[It] stretches credibility.
"Like cross-breeding a chihuahua with a Jack Russell, the result may be doubly cute, but also doubly annoying."
R-rated rot
"While Barrymore shows off some range in exploring the two characters, the script doesn't provide enough material for either of them to stand out."
Undercooked&#44; underwhelming&#44; schmaltzy and uneven while failing to pack an emotional punch&#46; 
Only Marian Waldman as the house-mother comes across with any life.
"It seems strange to say about an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, but ""Sabotage"" is flabby."
The execution is so laden with dated stylistic quirks that it feels like a relic from the late 1990s. The plot is pretty cookie-cutter too.
The continuity in X-Men: Apocalypse is even more of a nightmare than the continuity in X-Men comics.
Winnie-the-Pooh&#58; Blood and Honey takes every nonsensical horror trope to the base level&#46; The cheese factor is high&#46; The filmmakers put zero vision and creativity in a grotesque interpretation of childhood favorites&#46;
"Sounds like a grand old time -- a hip fusion of Nickelodeon attitude, the wittier children's books, and retro kitsch culture. In fact, it's a nearly unwatchable combination of the worst elements of all three."
This retelling of the famous Grimm fairy tale tries too hard to be funny.
Music Life is a film about a personality that carries little personality of its own.
A movie made up almost entirely of turning points and yet curiously devoid of drama or suspense.
"A spectacular mess, with no real focus or driving force."
"Contrived, cliched and condescending."
"Mostly indigestible, almost indescribable pot of Arthurian stew."
This year's spilled turkey tribute...provides an abundance of holiday stuffing/suffering in dispelling the dysfunctional family spirit.
"We can't even talk about the scene where, in the middle of the action, the hero wanders off just so he can steal a nice new jacket."
"It's constant blowing stuff up. Jyn Erso is STAR WARS ""Joan of Arc"" without a zealot's fervor or dynamic leadership presence. She is the only female fighter and all the nomad soldiers blindly follow her. What happened to Mendelsohn's face?"
"Ugly, unfocused photography makes it impossible to enjoy the film beyond its theoretical novelty."
"Warner's story is inspirational but intricate, and this wan film struggles to balance simple storytelling with the complexities of the sport."
You can't steal from every single stylistic choice from the history of sci-fi thrillers and not expect a complete train wreck.
This is a fascinating story that deserves a much different film.
"Decent messages in tepid indie dramedy; language, drug use."
"Thunder Force illustrates what happens when filmmakers take a moderately interesting premise and surround it with witless writing, cringe-inducing acting, stagnant action, humor-deprived comedy, and feckless drama."
Turn the page on this one.
"This nasty, witless and hopelessly dated effort is still a landmark release. Think of it like the first dog shot into space, but don't forget it is an absolute dog."
What really sinks this disappointing reunion is a narrative as stunted as Mavis' emotional development.
Simpson's dialogue flies like a flat-footed homage to Mamet or Tarantino.
"the film's allegorical terms are decidedly unstable and arguably compromised by the presence of Damon, a traditional white leading man, as the film's savior figure"
I can't shake the inkling that it would've worked better as straight documentary.
"Fueled by a decidedly American formula of can-do crazy, The Astronaut Farmer feels, for all its libertarianism, a little lost in space."
"For all of Samuell's imaginative cinematic bravura, it is, finally, mainly exasperating. Phooey on Julien and Sophie's excruciating l'amour fou."
"All in all, not as bad as you'd suspect and certainly serviceable for all who love the bloody, low-budget vamping gone wild."
"It is deflating to realise that even when doing what they love best, these characters are less than real."
"Although the movie posits a solution to an infamous missing person's case, it does so in a manner that is less than satisfying."
"John and the Hole as an intriguing enough premise holds you for some of its running time, but its lack of commitment to the black comedy or biting satire that it begs for leaves you wanting it to dig deeper."
"Although moments of playful wit abound throughout, Sponge Out of Water is often so nosily frenetic, it verges on being assaultive."
"One could only feel sorry for Alycia Delmore as the pliant wife of the silly husband, who goes along with his irritatingly neurotic friend's idea."
"Obvious throwback to the battle-of-the-sexes comedies of the 1940, but this film lacks the wit of those earlier movies and, more importantly, the point."
"At $12.75 a movie ticket, you might be better off buying the comic book."
Neither lights a fuse to our brains or hearts.
"""Mars Needs Moms"" is only consistent in that it's a mess."
A body swap thriller whose high-minded ambition is overwhelmed by a preposterous story and a reliance on action clichs.
Munich - The Edge of War had the potential to be so much more but instead&#44; it ends up just being historical fan fiction and gets Neville Chamberlain completely wrong in the process&#46;
"Despite a committed performance by Garner, Peppermint is an extremely forgettable and bland action movie that leaves no impression with the viewer."
Natali can't be bothered to fashion an actual human story around the perpetually buzzing toys and non-stop backstabbing and double-crossing.
"Geostorm feels like the sequel to a slightly better, slightly more expensive, significantly more Tom Cruisey film that made all its money in foreign-language territories."
"They got to make a movie on a beautiful island; the film itself might just be an afterthought. It feels like one, anyway."
This is simply an overwhelmingly dumb and boring.  [Full review in Spanish] 
"It takes a really long, slow and dreary time to dope out what TUCK EVERLASTING is about. So here it is: It's about a family of sour immortals."
"I don't read Nicholas Sparks books and can't say he shouldn't keep writing them. I do see the movies. I have expertise there and can say emphatically, stop making them."
"[Unhinged] isn't outright wretched, but its lack of logic and general common sense require the most willful suspension of disbelief."
"If only the film's level of visual creativity could have been applied to the story, it might feel like a standalone success instead of merely another link in the chain."
A peculiar and occasionally engaging thriller that unfortunately lacks thrills.
"Megatrash as only Bay can make it, this represents some of the most inane drivel ever to (dis)grace the screen-and an obscene waste of money to boot."
"It's all rather dispiriting and not quite the fun, trashy, thriller romp I was hoping for. Neither does it become terribly exciting or suspenseful ..."
"The tweener romantic fantasy Aquamarine is likely to strike a chord with junior-high girls, but other demographics are apt to find this fish-out-of-water story a bit dry."
"If the abysmal reception so far for films about the war in Iraq is any indication, Day Zero is the last thing movie audiences will want to consume."
"It is what it's about - kissing frogs for ratings, entertainment that panders to the lowest common denominator."
"You feel for Amy Adams, a six (!) time Oscar nominee stuck in an endless loop of mediocre scripts trying to land the next ""Arrival."""
"It's kind of a mess. That more than 20 minutes have been trimmed for the stateside release may have hurt the film's coherence, but viewers will be thankful for the shorter sit."
Special effects and ingenious production design cannot conceal a spectacular hollowness at the core of a ruined childhood legend.
"Sunshine Cleaning should have been a madcap comedy of the macabre, or a tangled yarn about the metaphorical biohazards of living life at the margins, but it shoots for the middle and ends up being just that: middling."
Tatum looks ready for Star Trek night at Magic Mike's
The little moments for and between these characters feel right. The larger connections ... aren't nearly as convincing.
"The mystery itself eventually becomes tiresome and shrug-worthy, even as the film breathlessly racks up the revelations."
...close-up brawls pack much-needed heat in a film that otherwise lacks zest and self-awareness.
...a waste of 100 million dollars and the talent of great actors...
"As empty, superficial and slavish as the celebrity culture it means to satirize."
"If you think the trailers look bad, just imagine how insufferable the movie is."
"Despite a sensitive, mature performance from Onata Aprile as Maisie, the girl remains withdrawn and opaque throughout. In telling this sad story from her perspective, it never quite plugs in to what Maisie felt."
At times powerful but often ponderous&#44; this Will Smith vehicle unevenly mixes action&#47;adventure&#44; dramaturgy and war scenes in the based-on-true story of a runaway slave&#46;
"The film is OSCAR BAIT in all caps: it has star actors, lots of makeup and tons of ugly crying."
"The dialogue is clunky, the delivery stilted, and the low production value makes it all feel like a flashback sequence from a very low-budget History Channel documentary about the Manson Family."
"It's a middle-of-the-road anthology but boasts great energy and a sense of humor that runs throughout, helping make even the mediocre entries watchable."
"With few laughs, barely tolerable characters and over-the-top action, THE NUT JOB clumsily makes the transition from short to feature film."
There's barely a laugh to be found in this new comedy from Horrible Bosses director Seth Gordon.
"Many will [...] praise [Toni] Collette's unflinching lack of vanity and honesty in this portrayal, but I found her performance predictable."
It struggles to manage many fragmented ideas and opposing impulses. [Full Review in Spanish]
"It is clunky, sophomoric, unconvincing, obvious, painful and dreadful and our erstwhile film stars gave this word vomit the delivery it deserved. Which is to say, terrible."
If only I cared.
It's an almost entirely pointless exercise.
"Parents eager to venture outside the animation or talking-Chihuahua boxes for family entertainment should check out the documentary The Little Red Truck, an inspiring look at a diverse array of youngsters introduced to the joys of stage performing."
"Watching a movie this life-sucking, you start to scour the surroundings for something -- anything -- to hold your interest."
"You desperately want to be grabbed and taken along for what should be one of the most exciting ""true stories"" in history, but instead you're stuck wondering why actors as good as Depp and Bale aren't able to make their characters come to life and a direct"
"A horribly misguided idea that never really gets off the ground yet still finds a way to crash-land, but even criticizing its obvious flaws misses the central, sad point: This movie has too much Bill Murray in it."
"His heart is in the right place, and our current situation cries out for a film like this %u2026 like this, but much better made."
[Merighe] has a hard time escaping the confines of the genre.
Stonewall is a movie about a pivotal moment in LGBT history as filtered through the perspective of a fictional hunk of Wonder Bread named Danny who steps off a bus from Indiana and right into a central role in the Christopher Street scene.
Much of the film is heavy-handed melodrama without the irony and forgiveness that animated its protagonist's moral worldview.
"Tooth Fairy is clunky, hideously overlit and bland."
"Affleck the director tries his best to infuse a glamorous Latin lushness into his frames and, for the most part, the atmospherics work, but sultriness is a poor substitute for dramatic tension."
This one's dead in the water.
It just isn't very funny.
"""Made in Dagenham"" plays like ""Norma Rae"" on blood thinners."
"Wildly uneven, ""Welcome to Me"" comes off as a cry for help, yet the production tends to process instability as quirk, attempting to find the bright side of psychological decay."
A picture so carefully narrowed feels like an adaptation to current trends and tends to distort life somewhat.
"Think of it as a Last Tango in Paris for the Internet generation, with cell phones instead of butter as the story's chief accessory. But instead of Brando and Bertolucci, we have Kutcher and Reitman, and the result is the usual rom-com ditherings."
Despite handsome production values and a crackerjack supporting cast&#44; &quot;The Shadow&quot; remains a temperamental trinket that lacks the temerity to truly explore&#44; as its titular hero would say&#44; what evil truly lurks in the hearts of men&#46;
"I got the idea, because of the title, that 'Your Highness' would be a stoner comedy. It is in a couple of spots. More than that, though, it's a just-serviceable, grownups-only nod to other medieval fantasy movies."
An exercise in what it critiques -- the self-involvement and self-dramatization of performers.
"Love the Coopers is significantly flawed, but it also contains enough ambition to rise slightly above the norm for this sort of thing. As the old saying goes, it's just good enough to make you wish it was better."
"It's another flick through a familiar and by-now bulging scrapbook, but it leaves you craving less - and more."
"To call the Ocean's films frivolous would be kind, implying that these arduous concoctions are somehow light on their proverbial feet."
"The running news items on Joe DiMaggio's baseball scores, and the soppy and very unMarlow-like use of kids, are no good to the film and the very kind of interference Chandlerian purists most vigorously detest."
Cranston's accent is Dick-Van-Dyke-in-Mary-Poppins-bad.
"The ""life"" this movie looks in on - Harlem in its most glorious epoch - feels pristine, preserved under glass, not ""lived"" by flash and blood characters."
"Like the beast it sets out to analyze, the film is defeated by its dual identity: drama and comedy."
"Andrea Berloff doesn't manage to provide her first feature film an esthetic, setting, suspense, or narrative tension that would have made it into something particularly creative and attractive... It's a wasted opportunity. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"You'll need a pair of hip waders to make your way through the clichs that the actors have to spout: You Can't Trust Anyone, No One Gets Away Clean, and Live It Up Because There Is No God Anyway."
"Dashcam, unlike few films, relies on your annoyance."
"After the excellent Milk, this is more like curdled cheese."
A big waste of much top-flight talent.
"The nonsensical screenplay can barely stand-up to the hellzapoppin,' Beelzebubbin' effects mustered by first-time director Mark Dippe."
Ponsoldt&#8217;s most puzzling effort so far&#44; a genre jumble roping together a kid-detective novel&#44; a ghost story&#44; a hokey &#8220;do you know where your children are&#8221; PSA and a coming-of-age dramedy&#46;
Well-made tripe.
"It's hard not to view The Grey as either schlock with delusions of grandeur, or a bleak art-house parable masquerading as popcorn hokum."
This self-indulgent bilge is about -- absolutely nothing!
It may be the first movie in which a character stops shaving his chest in order to express his independence.
Treacly and bromidic ...
"The Front Runner is unbelievably naive in its cynicism about the tabloidization of the political process, ultimately (and possibly by accident because of ineptitude) making an anti-transparency argument that would appease the ""fake news"" dingbats."
The filmmakers ... seem to have been inspired mainly by contempt for the audience: everything about their work feels lazy and slapdash.
"Screenwriter Andy Bloom struggles to sustain the tensions between the holed-up thugs, with much of the talented supporting cast having too little to do."
"The filmmakers weasel their way into a happy -- and, icky poo, morally uplifting -- ending."
Paris Hilton and lower-level office workers who own calendars featuring Weimaraners wearing hats will love it.
Offensively racist and too gormless even for the kids at whom it is evidently aimed: Third World cinema of a quite... uncommon kind.
"The thinness shows -- there isn't much of a story. Beatrix starts out as a feisty, idiosyncratic, talented gal and, save for a momentary lapse after a brush with tragedy, remains so right to the end of the bunny trail."
"A string of ill-timed pranks, bad acting and poor writing."
"Vacation Friends finds its humor in the disconcerting scenarios the characters find themselves in, but it never evolves past its empty premise."
"After spinning two wonderful superhero yarns, Raimi and his collaborators appear to be running low on the webbing of inspiration."
Ashton still awaits a film that could make use of his talents.
A flag-waving tribute that both simplifies and sanitizes the war to a trivial degree.

It has the feel of a bold idea that has been watered down.
The movie's premise isn't a story. It's a stand-up comedy joke...
"Warmly familiar and not without a notable degree of poignancy, it's disappointing to see glimpses of the strength this scenario and cast could have commanded if Talbert's script didn't circulate almost exclusively in obvious beats."
The script&#44; by rookie writer Ben Ramsey&#44; is among the most disgraceful screenplays ever to be produced by a major studio&#46;

The joyless tone seeps off the screen and ultimately takes its toll on the viewer.
"Psycho is not a long film but it feels long. Perhaps because the director dawdles over technical effects; perhaps because it is difficult, if not impossible, to care about any of the characters."
This poor Oliver Twist update needs to be artfully dodged.

A movie full of cliches and obvious symbolism. [Full review in Spanish]
"An empty-headed, grotesquely dissatisfying cinematic journey."
The duo also seems too focused on justifying their own controversial actions and harping on the humor element in the sequel.

Glibness takes over all too often.
"Without comprehensive scientific data, it's hard to determine whether the Rock is igneous or metamorphic, but his latest film is definitively moronic."
Miller's commitment to the role makes a mockery of the movie's conservative and predictable riches-to-rags story arc and the conventionality of its 'edgy' visual strategy.

In these starved-for-content times&#44; Somebody I Used to Know is grounds for going on an intermittent fast&#46;

"The biggest problem, ironically, is that even though the plot and the action center on smoking pot, it's not enough of a stoner flick."
"The film moves jerkily, in fits and starts, squandering its promising setup and bogging down in explanation."
"The resultant film is, he says, faithful to both Stoppard's script and Nabokov's novel; it is certainly not faithful to Fassbinder, who is here seen tripping over one style after another and ending up utterly ditched."
Half of this film is so dark and grainy it looks like the Paris Hilton sex video.

"Aja's version is a blunt, Ghost Rider-esque superhero origin story about a kid and his devil-themed powers, punctuated by moments of weird comedy."
"You should feel something. That the overwhelming sensation provoked by Nia DaCosta's Candyman is numbness, then, is a problem."
"The unimaginative script matches the uninspired action scenes, which are worsened by shabby computer graphics. The laziness of this franchise is apparent in the third part..."

"Yes Man is more forgettable than awful, not the hit that it should have been but far from the most unbearable gift Hollywood has handed out in this lackluster holiday season."
"Without forcing comparisons, Frontrunners finds parallels between the election at Stuyvesant High and the current national election."
"Sadly, this is a truly excellent story that is told with exceptionally poor ability."
"Reiner is undecided just how fantastically he should treat this ludicrous plotline. Added to which there's a dire musical number, a silly thriller subplot, and much maudlin didacticism from narrator Willis in various guardian angel (dis)guises. Misery."
It ends up feeling somewhat forced. [Full review in Spanish]
"Three of the comic segments in The Ten are sort of funny. Three others are just so-so. And the remaining four are just dumb, painfully unfunny and/or downright crude."
"The only high point of Shankar's I is Vikram's enthralling performance, first as a rustic body builder and later as a disfigured hunchback."

a timely idea poorly executed by someone who usually excels at this kind of thing

"[A] tastefully packaged but borderline offensive slice of revenge porn, which starts promisingly but is slowly (alas, very slowly) drowned by backstory."
The sub-par material is too much to overcome&#46; I especially hate to see such a strong Denzel performance go to waste&#44; but in reality there just isn&#8217;t enough here to make this anything more than an average movie&#46;
I must believe Bertino wanted more of a connection between monster and psychology than he's able to clearly communicate onscreen.
Emotional investment is what makes any film work&#44; and GOOD NIGHT OPPY&#8217;s main issue is that it&#8217;s too focused on accurately portraying the history of the project over bringing together the people who poured their lives into making it a success&#46;
Offers almost nothing to fans old and new save for a shiny coating of paint.
"A movie that is not just humorless but pointless, or, to be generous, painfully obvious."
Nine Months needed a lot longer gestation.
"What's so frustrating about ""2012"" is that it could have been a great action movie. If the special effects team can do their jobs, certainly better writers could have been hired. But no. Just try finding a surprise."
"Williams' film indulges itself in all the worst ways, merrily embracing all things emotionally manipulative, clichéd and twee."

"the film has a tonal imbalance that makes you feel like you're constantly see-sawing, with one moment pandering to tykes and the next pandering to their parents"
"Guns down credible acting, believable dialogue and historical accuracy."
"Call is the first major motion picture release of 2008, in charge of setting the tone for the lengthy year to come. My friends, the future does not look promising. In fact, it feels like a swift kick to the groin."
"Ultimately a stodgy, overblown and repetitive slog."
"More often than not it, seems like a pale retread of its predecessors."
"The falling chandelier, the signature moment of Phantom, has been moved from the end of the first act to the climax of the movie -- by which point non-devotees may need to be roused from their sleep by their companions."
They could have just bought him a tie.
Backtrack starts promisingly but becomes wildly improbable as it proceeds.
"If it weren't for the imaginative and eye-catching costumes by three-time Oscar winner Sandy Powell, Cinderella could be mistaken for a typical Disney Channel special."
"A dull, bland, and unfunny meshing of sub-genres that probably might have been charming if it didn't tack on the raunchy nonsense."
"The overlong comedy has few laughs and flirts far too much with racist, homophobic humor. A waste of a fine cast."
A bad French Lieutenant's Woman-like romance.
A contrived plot with a predictable twist and overuse of syrupy montages undermine its rock and roll credentials.
Things might have worked better if Ritter's character didn't creep you out as such a snake-in-the-grass.
Sticks in the ribs like over baked mush.
"A little pretentious by the half-hour mark. An hour beyond that, medication begins to sound like an attractive option."
A punishing social media satire.
"Von Trier may be a provocateur, but his brand of provocation seems to be growing stale."
"Bromances like Funny People do a disservice to the friendship capabilities of straight men, making them seem stunted."
This is not nearly as intense or terrifying [as the original]. 
Ring-a-ding dull.
"Watching it is the equivalent of listening to two hours of whiny, pretentious emo."
Offsetting its naughtier impulses with feel-good schmaltz&#44; it employs a tired formula to losing results&#46;
"Writer-director Marchal loses track of characters, story threads, mob cash and drugs, impatient as he is to get to the next shoot-out."
"Director John Curran's Chappaquiddick is a decent Cliff's Notes version of events, though it's hard not see sanitization masquerading as ambiguity."
"Bother! Or, rather, why bother?"
"The horrific finale makes Rambo himself seem like the real monster, making you briefly wonder if Stallone is aware of the irony. On balance, one suspects not."

"Even among the dogs of summer, The Cave scrapes bottom."
Fails to offer even one compelling reason for its pathetic existence.
"Garcia's take, however beautiful physically, is intellectually opaque and creatively cautious, leaving the interested viewer, whether or not a believer, with much to wonder about but little to actually chew on."
"Moronic jokes, lame action and depictions of middle-aged neuroses. In other words: a Sandler movie."
"Back in 1974, this type of frenetic crud was considered to be popular entertainment."
"In the end, the door is left open for a Taken 3, although you do rather wish the Mills family would just throw away their passports."
Ma isn't a bad film. It just isn't very convincing.
"An overstuffed, overlong (160 minutes) period piece."
"Montana Story, for all its beauty, grows tiresome because it has nowhere to drive other than toward reconciliation."
This tired mulch of fantasy clichés is hampered by its regressive attitude towards its plucky heroine.
"Instead of showing how prejudice seeps into the private intimacies of daily life, the film turns its attention to the other characters."
"It's a nasty, condescending, small-minded film, self-amused and ultimately self-defeating. Its only accomplishment is to make atheists look bad -- and in this political climate they didn't need Maher's help with that."
The Night Porter is unsatisfactory and remarkably uneven. [Full Review in Spanish]
"It is genuinely, consistently, indisputably putrid."
"A pity the equation doesn't always add up: there's too much slack, due perhaps to an imbalance between the comedy, which runs riot, and the horror, which trails behind in the wake of previous Corman films."
[There is no] conflict or any intriguing situation that gives impetus to the movie. [Full review in Spanish]
"Let's hope that Vol. 3 recaptures the fizz of the original, instead of slumping into the most expensive group-therapy session in the universe."
Great cast squandered in a flimsy finale.
"Sweet enough but in the end a bit of a corny-syrupy wipeout, this is middling family-night fare, but it never even comes close to the emotional or technical wizardry of Pixar's finest moments."
This film's impact is hampered by a slavish adherence to chronology and vintage audio materials.
"Unfortunately, or fortunately if you're hoping Lion's Gate Films takes a bath for pretending that sadistic pornography is fun fare for Halloween, the movie [is] pretty dull."
"""Zinging"" is destiny, and even if it strikes one person before the other, it's still meant to be. In the real world this translates to harassment and stalking."
"Bottom line: nice puppetry, crappy movie."
An amusing but predictable knock-off of themes that have been done much better.
"Nothing is exultant, dramatic, epic, heroic, complex or just entertaining to me. The film is overwhelmingly empty, and lacks minimal grace and rhythm. [Full review in Spanish]"
The weirdest and rarest misfire in Lee's illustrious career.
I'm being generous by saying A Bad Moms Christmas is like getting socks as a gift.
Reese Witherspoon has already done what would need to be done to make Breach a better film: Kick Ryan Phillippe to the curb.
"It's believable that the screenplay was originally a parody, but it was written at a time when erotic thrillers had a certain sleazy seriousness. Say it with me: Wild Orchid."

Looking good is just about all Faster does.
Intriguing if ultimately less than satisfying.
It's all ups and downs and I can't emphasize enough that the Beast is a horrifying pile of animated taxidermy.
...yet another late-career misfire from Spielberg...

Making a heist film about the well-off during a pandemic is absolutely ludicrous.
"The entire film is pretty much saved by Cusack, who seems to add so much to even the most stereotypical role."

stodgy and listless futuristic thriller that only ever echoes other cinematic sci-fi tomorrows.
"In Victoria & Abdul, the Empress of India comes off honest, loving and decent. That seems deaf as well as stupid."
[All I see is You] spins its wheels stylishly but doesn't go anywhere.
Ultimately &#8220;Focus&#8221; is a movie stymied by its amoral vanity&#44; its overload of mediocre twists and turns&#44; and the lukewarm chemistry between Smith and Robbie&#46;
Remaking the classic Hollywood epic and 11-time Oscar winner Ben-Hur seems redundant - so 2016's Ben-Hur starts on the back foot.
"Given the capable performances and a few memorable scenes, it's difficult to pinpoint why this handsome, competent production can't offer much more satisfaction..."
A chilling idea and an interesting central performance are undercut by pretty much everything else in this apocalyptic action film about a second American Civil War.
"Too much of it was just repellent, redundant or irrelevant."
"Paw Patrol &#65279;has enough action to keep young fans entertained, but parents will likely be bored by the dragging pace and convoluted plot."
Just a series of repetitions on the same gag -- and it's a pretty tired joke to begin with.

"Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces."
"Even if you wander into this congealed mess with nothing more demanding in mind than to spend a little time with two charming favorites, do not expect Forrest Gump or Pretty Woman."
"The whole thing is pretty stupid, but Angus Macfadyen is watchable as the villain."
"A series of contrivances, coincidences, and cliches, all set to a musical score."
Almost good enough to earn a recommendation.

"Rum should be mandatory for every man, woman, and child misguidedly attempting to make sense of the frantic Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End."
"Katzir's documentary is on the cusp of posing worthy questions about American assimilation and cultural evolution, but it'd rather appeal to guilt and sympathy for art that we never get to feel."
"Along the way, it lost itself, turning into something that is neither here or there. It is a film that is as confused as its barren characters."
The Cold Light of Day is a colossal mess -- and amazingly dumb.
"Lasse Hallstrom's costume comedy Casanova is pretty flat. In fact, it's leaking air all over the place."
It could stand as Exhibit A for why French auteurs are a tough sell to the average seeker of entertainment.
"Stephen Daldry tries his hand at a realist fairy tale set in the slums of Rio, with mixed results."
"Considering what a commanding majority of the film's running time is made up of large-scale action scenes and chases in CGI environments, it's disastrous that only one of them is any good."
Even the kids in the audience will feel a bit insulted by the dumbed-down dialogue and a bit cheated by the bargain-basement special effects.
The Wall ... tries very hard to achieve that seriousness of purpose that shouts importance with every spoken word.
"[VIDEO ESSAY] Between the film's white-world-order depiction of a multicultural society and its ham-fisted treatment of an ostensibly pro-ecology agenda, ""Rio 2"" is a confused piece of animation propaganda."

Alexander limps along from one fancy set to another.

The lack of originality behind Moonshot causes it to fall short of being memorable.
"It is hard not to admire Ms. Cotillard for the discipline and ferocity she brings to the role. But it is equally hard to be completely swept up in Mr. Dahan's dutiful, functional and ultimately superficial film."

"It's a visually flashy but emotionally hollow drama that goes nowhere, and at two hours and 21 minutes, takes a long time to get there."

"Dialogue and character development in Bushwick may be disappointing, as is Aesop Rock's generic, over-employed score."

"This is being called a satire, but satires -- theoretically -- should at least make you laugh. "

"Thought is absent in Religulous, as is imagination. The movie is Maher's monument to Maher, as ugly and hateful as anything he decries in the film."
"It's layers upon layers upon layers of not story, but...what's the word? Oh right. Production design."
"Despite the best efforts of stars Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Will Ferrell, remake of Force Majeure isn't nearly as entertaining."
"How could director Rob Reiner, whose touch for what pleases a mass audience is usually unfailing, have strayed this far?"
"It's a story that may have worked better on stage, or in a short film. On the big screen it feels thin."
"In the end, Snow White and the Huntsman proves that style can never triumph over material."
"The Smurfs might keep the little cherubs diverted for an hour and a half, but only if they're not too discerning."

It's as if the WB took Harry Potter and turned it into Five Hot Underwear Models Go Back to High School and Do Magic...
"A hopelessly rambling, amateurish mess of disjointed thoughts and imagery."
Not only plot-heavy but just plain goofy.
"While I appreciate and respect Miller's focus on nature and innocence, I couldn't help but feel the film was puffed up and sustaining itself on esoteric nonsense."
"Naming the movie after The Clash's late-career disco hit (which doesn't appear in the movie) [suits] what is essentially watered down-politically, musically, culturally, and cinematically."
A Hopkins personal vanity project
"As we watch this series of deaths and reincarnations unfold, we're not given much incentive for emotional investment in the characters, whether of the two-legged or four-legged variety."
The romantic dramedy Catch and Release is off the mark in so many respects one wonders if it would have been more humane to release this one directly into the DVD stream.
"I hope that in the name of her decades-spanning career and six Academy Award nominations (plus one win), we might do MacLaine the small courtesy of forgetting that this pedestrian and dull comedy ever happened."
Everything about the lives of these characters ... is left hanging at the end. The Big Game is all that really matters.
I haven't seen a bigger mess in wide release since Dana Carvey's career-terminating The Master of Disguise.
"So bad and gutless that it makes one wonder if director Joel Zwick intentionally tried to make the least interesting, and most grating movie possible."
"Nonstop jokes are intended to keep the audience entertained, but many are overwhelmingly immature or simply not that funny."
"The story doesn't make any real sense, and the production values are home movie-cheap."
"If Batman, Daredevil and Jason Bourne had a baby who loved calculus, you'd have The Accountant. Think of this one as more of a write-off."
"Scream, smash, slap, cry, repeat. The only respite: fleeting scenes of Debi Mazar as a librarian, rocking a cardigan and reading glasses."
"The satire of self-satisfied, opportunistic Brooklynites is cutting, but it lacks the humanity afforded the upstate characters, and quickly repeats itself, seemingly by design."
"All the expensive surface distraction in the world can't make up for leaden plotting, paper-thin characters and lousy dialogue."
"Animating a biopic doesn't make it any less plodding, and this account of a Japanese aeronautics expert ca. the 1930s spends too little time on the details of his work and too much time on a fabricated, Love Story-style romance."
"This is Ganata's second film in a row that operates as an industry fantasy, sanding down edges when it should be poking holes."
dwells on the realistic effects of a fairly ridiculous idea - one that is clearly better suited to farce
An outsized A&E Biography episode coursing with the strident urgency typical to anyone convinced they have something new to say on a long since played-out topic.
James McAvoy's outstanding performance anchors a shockingly unsatisfying conclusion to M. Night Shyamalan's Eastrail 177 Trilogy.
And the award for Loopiest Completely Fabricated Fact-Based Drama in Which a Famous Actor Radically Alters His Appearance for No Apparent Reason goes to...whatever this is.
There just isn't enough material here to justify a running time of this length.
"Does a standard-issue biopic become more interesting when its subject is relatively unknown? Turns out, it does not."
It’s wonderful that Mendes spent the pandemic making a movie about the irreplaceable vitality of movie theaters... It would have been even better if he spent the pandemic making a movie worth seeing in one.
"C'mon C'mon is yet another rendition of this tired [quirky kid] premise, though this one doesn't even really try to construct much internal drama within its scenario."
"You lift, Dude Bro? Cuz this ship is sinking..."
"The result isn't spiritual awakening, but a talky travelogue - like riding a tour bus with a passenger who won't shut up about her inner journey."
"Though fitfully entertaining, it lacks the conviction and urgency present in even the weakest of his quasi agit-prop productions."
"The real mystery is ""Why did Simon Pegg reunite with the 'Terminal' Director?"" [Full review in Spanish]"
"Nothing awful, nothing special."
"[J]ust like Eurovision night itself, shamelessly outstays its welcome."
The sort of incoherent mess that invariably goes straight to video.
The First Purge- for all that it could have said about race and class in America- is perfectly content to provide the bare minimum and deliver some cheap thrills.
At its core this is just another piece of big-studio nothingness.
A movie about four months too late to endure in the pop-culture annals and about four stars too short to be a four-star movie.
Gambling drama never seems to draw the right cards. Best to fold...
You People is a perfect movie for Netflix because it&#8217;s best watched for the first half hour and then turned off&#44; which Netflix will count as a view anyway&#46;

It's Solo: A Star Wars Story mixed with The Devil Wears Prada with a dash of Ocean's Eleven and a little A Hard Day's Night on the side.
"Howard's film would've been far more interesting had it been willing to explore [the complexity of poverty], instead of sanitizing it and shining it up nicely for award season."
"One problem with the movie, directed by Joel Schumacher, is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time."
It narrowly misses being a list of fan winks.  [Full review in Spanish] 
"This is not a good film, with weak acting and worse direction, but what makes the feature a true spirit-crusher is how badly it botches an original perspective, trading valuable veteran insight for clich."
"features a winning cast and is jam-packed with some pretty good action scenes, but it's also so defanged that the film doesn't engender any real tension."
"Starts off as a funny, smart and witty look at this art school subculture and the characters within it, but falls apart"
The series' nadir...nothing but a delivery system for murder and half-glimpses of naked women.
A frenetic and freewheeling satirical comedy that only sporadically scores a bull's-eye while aiming at easy targets.
"I found myself endlessly fascinated with the futuristic setting, but the disconnect with the main characters was hard to overcome."
Maidentrip is full of sunsets and dolphins but short on introspection and drama.
Birth is entirely misconceived.
"A second helping of infantile lowjinks...a lazy, plotless excuse for a comedy."
Eventually it just stalls.
"A jumble of spiritual and musical references that is either self-indulgent or daring, but a little creepy in both cases."
"The dialog is very terrible. And the problem, therefore, is that the actors have to wrestle with very terrible dialog."
"I thought it was a fun movie, if not a bit disingenuous. For every truth the movie offers into the secret lives of girls, a pat resolution or a schmaltzy moment follows. "
"For a film about the ultimate triumph of Good over Evil, Bless the Child sure is bleak and moody."
"Even watched in an indulgent frame of mind, this is dull, retrograde rubbish."
"Muddled, overwrought ..."
"Viewers may be more likely to ride with Martin's and Latifah's good vibes than to analyze the lunkheaded racial politics, but very little is fresh here."
"Instead of piercing flesh and tinsel, the satiric shots almost slither off the screen."
Leaden when the lead isn't flying.
"This 1939 release is still watchable, though the spirit is now sitcom."
"Doesn't delve deep enough into the void and back again to leave a cartoonish hammerhead imprint on the brain or a tear-soaked membrane around our swollen, bleeding hearts."
"Greatly enhanced by Moreno...While I don't doubt the documentary truths in Marston's account, as drama it's hard to swallow."
The problem with situation comedy movies in general - and Will Ferrell vehicles such as The Campaign in particular - is that they usually fizzle out after the first 30 minutes.
"Wonderstruck feels like a serious misfire, mired in the sort of sentiment we might expect from Disney or a Nicholas Sparks adaptation rather than one of art-house cinema's favourite sons."
"... The movie gets increasingly saccharine, like being forced to drink a mug of tea with a new lump of sugar added every time you take a gulp."
This intermittently interesting symbolic tour through European history once again places ideas over aesthetics and technique.
...like a made-for-TV movie that asks nothing more of you than to figure out its own particular brand of slight-of-hand.
...hilarity is supposed to ensue. But it really just doesn't.
The Gallows is a complete mess and only worth watching if you have an odd fascination of staring at floors while characters run away in a panic
"It's like watching someone watching the movie, which is itself like watching cats dry."
A step up from the run of fare ordinarily targeted at the so-called urban audience...But it doesn't step up far enough.
"The blame for this exercise in pointlessness can be allotted fairly equally, I think, between [director Tanya] Wexler and screenwriter/cast member Brian Sacca."
"The key performances are strong, but director/co-writer Julie Taymor's movie meanders too much, dragging through the beginning and again toward the end."
Watson’s fine performance and Brown’s thoughtful stylish touches (especially in the sound design) make the slice-of-life scenes special. The rest of the picture is more sketched-in.
Isn't likely to satisfy either action buffs or the actor's fans.
"So little works here. The structure is muddled, the characters are bland, and the point being made is so thin, it doesn't warrant its own existence."
There&#8217;s no sugar-coating how hard a sell the romance is here&#44; even as every obstacle that Poppy faces seems designed to be overcome in time for a happy ending&#44; Down Syndrome be damned&#46;
A Budweiser and NASCAR slushee.
"The Bad Batch has a thin story and an incoherent world populated by unconvincing characters, and I felt bored and depressed watching it."
A misguided clunker that borders on being offensive.
"Jupiter Ascending is only slightly less absurd than Moon Quake Lake, the fake movie within the recent remake of Annie. The difference is that Moon Quake Lake was trying to be ridiculous."
"The movie never seems to make up its mind but, far worse, it never quite gets inside Betty's."
"Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far On Foot has all the pieces in the right place but nowhere to go."
Under the Stadium Lights is pee wee by comparison to Peter Berg's All-American.
"Charlie Sheen, Estevez's brother, is nowhere in sight, though there are times the film could use a shot of tiger blood."
"Too violent for kids, too childish for grown-ups."
"In the light of the #MeToo movement, Shelley's travails are both timeless and topical in a way that rarely aligns. A series of baffling decisions and a weak script unfortunately contribute to undermining her tale and sucking the life from it."
"Embarrassingly vapid ... a film that asks its audience to show ""unfunded empathy"" for the travails of ageing, bourgeois husbands and wives looks less like escapist fun and more like oblivious contempt."
A dreadful and unappealing comedy about a couple whose marriage is in jeopardy.
"Even as a summer throwaway, this college comedy about nerds, those born-to-be-victimized souls, is pitifully thin."
The Incredible Burt Wonderstone has one major problem: the main character isn't nearly as interesting as everyone who surrounds him.
Action sequences-way too familiar-mixed with a plot-far too transparent-yields a not very exciting Bourne...
"It's all very sex-lite - one character even does what Eamonn Holmes did last year, confusing lesbian with Lebanese."
"Artsy vertigo, racial profiling from outer space, black on prawn violence, Nigerian gangsters into cannibalistic health food diets, and inter-species creature sex for sale. And no, I did not have sex with that alien."
"Magical, in that it manages to make two hours seem like four, make good actors seem like hacks and make ice burps unintentionally funny rather than as terrifying as they should be."

A big mess&#46;
"A remote and chilly exercise, more museum piece than movie."
"There's an interesting story here, to be sure, about the birth of the modern technological age, and how much ego and personality played a role in its development, but Almereyda is more interested in playing games with the audience."
"Except for ticking the right diversity boxes and a few funny moments, this isn't even what women want let alone what men want."
"Overwrought, melodramatic bodice-ripper."
Feels as if it would work better as a pilot for a television series - perhaps chiefly because the conclusion is a mere setup for further tales in this speculative world.
The fly-on-the-wall convers-ations between the Eilish family often go on far too long and creep into the toe-curlingly pretentious.
Bring the Prozac . . .
Drums up the odd moment of effective mild suspense before succumbing to standard genre shenanigans
"Ghostbusters: Afterlife is a reminder that going back to the well just for the sake of going there leads to empty, cynical results that insult fans rather than love them back."
If you like your characters bland&#44; your dialogue snarky and your battles meaningless&#44; then you&apos;ll love &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&#58; Honor Among Thieves&#44;&quot; a movie that wants you to like it so bad&#44; that it actually hurts&#46;
"... you're so conscious of the vehicle's artifice, so aware of actors performing, that it's difficult to react to them as living, breathing characters ..."
"A isappointing hybrid that's too bloated, diffuse and tedious to work as a regular length movie -- yet has not enough emotional range or narrative focus to be considered a great epic drama."
An absolutely abhorrent ghost story...
There's not too much new that Knocking brings to the table.
"I suppose it's always nice to get an invitation but please, this ""Wedding""? Send back your regrets."
"Something here feels lost in translation. ""France"" is like trying to complete a puzzle when one of the pieces is missing. "
"Paul Verhoeven's exceedingly violent, surprisingly pointless invisible-man tale nearly warrants a trotting-out of the Union-Tribune's dreaded 'dog' designation."
"Stick with ""Basket Case."""
"While most sequels have nowhere to go, this sequel has nowhere it wants to go, and while most movie failures are unoriginal, this mess is simply uninspired."
"The racing sequences are effectively done and Secretariat's quest for horse racing's Triple Crown concludes with one of those stand-up-and-cheer moments, but the story as a whole seems stale and overly familiar."
This isn't so much a bad film as it is a dead one.
Stupid futuristic nonsense.
Mozart lovers will be intrigued but dissatisfied.
"Forget the tears of a clown as it pertains to inner psychology of a comedian -- what about the rage of a clown? That's the principal focus of The Bitter Buddha, a doc that's too polite and removed."
Never really transcends the formula.
Somewhere between thriller and propaganda.
"Sono's films certainly aren't known for following a straight line from A to B, but this time around, there's barely any internal logic or rules or even stakes to make this jumble of genre tropes remotely interesting."
"The Discovery is not a revelation, and it's not even that new. What it is, however, is an interesting question asked in an uninteresting way."
"an insufferably mawkish, mentally-challenged melodrama of self-aggrandizing proportions."
When you finish with that&#44; save us from the paces of having to spend another moment with any of these characters&#46;
"With nods to Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick and a host of sci-fi B-movies, the film's pop-culture references are there but predictable rather than inspired. A bit like the whole movie."
"The clichés, like the dresses, sashay in and out of this predictable if nicely fluffy chick-flick composite, which manages to crank out a few decent laughs when it isn't wasting time on a pair of deadly supporting characters."
"Filled with gorgeous images, expertly assembled and perfectly set to music. But for the most part, it's all completely superfluous"
This real monastery looks as if it were designed by the artist M. C. Escher.
The Woman in the Window makes a solid argument for being a low point for all involved.

Much of the action feels thin and inauthentic&#46;

Mann's idea of following data through computer systems leaves you thinking he's worn out his VHS tape of Tron.
"Had it rejected the genre's romantic trappings and false heroics more consistently, the movie might've been worth the ride."
"In order to present this purpose as Chris assumes it, the film must omit context or considerations of how the war was declared and waged, whether political decisions were flawed."
Gigli makes a bid for that rare honor: The movie so bad it's good. It falls short.
"For a film that deals with adultery, racism, immigration and class struggle, Loco Love is a startlingly weightless work."
"Down the elevator goes into the desert sands - a man-made lake at this level, a working reconstruction of the Bush years at the next level, Kim Kardashian's closet at the level past that."
Olivia Colman can’t save Sam Mendes’s befuddling nostalgia trip.
"Maher's journey's not about finding out what makes religious people tick, but about using the tics of mostly fringe religious people to prop up the thesis Maher came in with."

"The devil made them do it, all right. Ugh. My eyes."
"""The Giver' is a bit of a dud on-screen, and we might have seen it coming - writing about an emotionless society is one thing, filming one is quite another."
"(Rodriguez's) gimmicks have improved, but the heart of the series is gone."
The ending is so supremely awful that whatever progress had been made up to that point was washed away by the film&apos;s obtrusively climactic storm&#46;
It is always maddening watching musical 'geniuses' in the cinema when their visibly incompetent efforts bear no relation to what you hear.
There&#8217;s no gold here&#44; but there are one or two serviceable shootouts &#40;which is still not nearly enough excitement to recommend this slog&#41;
"I am a fan of The Muppets and I'm glad to see them making a comeback. Maybe if this movie is a hit, they'll make a sequel where they'll actually get to be the stars of their own film."
"Had he cast a Westerner (such as himself) in the lead role, Herzog could've avoided this Orientalist gawkfest."
"""We Are Your Friends"" will probably date faster than most movies - there can't possibly be a genre more disposable than electronic dance music."
"Sometimes, the first one is better."
"""Hancock"" is not a bad movie, just an underachieving one. It lacks a ""wow"" factor. It is bland and routine and flies off in too many directions."
"There's nothing wrong with old fashioned if done the right way, but 'The Promise' feels like the kind of film that's out of date."
"Like the vast expanses of space, this film seems to drag on forever."
"Peninsula falls into the classic sequel trap of trying to make things bolder, bigger, and darker at the expense of emotional depth and originality."
A drawn out cat-and-mouse game never catches fire.
The jokes are so few and far between that you can see them backing into position up to 15 minutes in advance - like a ten-ton truck making a bad-gag delivery.
"Betraying its origins as the last half of another movie, rather than its own entity, Kill Bill Vol. 2 feels like leftovers."
"The tragedy is not particularly tragic except in rote recitation of what came before, the comedy not particularly comic."
"Another formulaic spin on Hollywood's 21st century discovery, the mom-rom-com, with its disagreeable underlying messages about women, careers and motherhood."
"Not since the Cats movie have I literally shouted from my seat: ""What? What? WHAT?"""
"You cannot expect a bunch of vacationing kids to remember, let alone revere, a cheeky little TV half hour that entertained the old folks almost a half century ago."

"Haynes' cabinet of wonders is exquisitely carved, inlaid and varnished, but it has precious little inside."
"A crackpot suspense film about a fishing boat captain who veers into perilous existential waters, Serenity tries to pull off a ""bait-and-switch"" times two. But will anyone take the bait either time?"
"This kind of weepy material works in the hands of melodrama masters like Douglas Sirk or Pedro Almodovar. But here, it's over-the-top and it's just horrible."
"[It] focuses on unspoken adolescent feelings instead of familiar puerile events, with clichs held at arm's length. Unfortunately, Hide Your Smiling Faces is so slow it could use a few action sequences to speed things up."
This drama seems more like a statement than a story.
Like a bad sitcom version of My Big Fat Indian Wedding.
"An ugly, bloated, repetitive movie that builds to a punch line that should have come an hour earlier."
Even by the suspended-disbelief standards of fluff it is unnerving; it creates a movie world that has no idea of the boundaries being violated.
Plays out as a mountain of self-righteously guilt-ridden rhetoric perched on a molehill of narrative.
"Stuffs male jackassery into a paper-thin piata of a contrived plot, then blindly bashes us over the head, again and again, with a stick marked 'SEE WHAT AN OLD MAN AND A YOUNG BOY CAN GET AWAY WITH!'"

Roger Donaldson embellishes an already overly plotty scenario with hollowly attractive genre superfluities.

"American Christmas, a franchise as exportable as Valentine's Day or Halloween. [Full review in Spanish]"
An undistinguished romantic drama that takes few risks and offers wish-fulfilling escapism with bland dutifulness.
"This sequel continues the story as nothing has changed in the past fourteen years. That is to the film's credit, and also its detriment."
"The problem with a film that uses CGI as a substitute for good writing is that virtually every picture that comes along nowadays has impressive visual effects; this has leveled the playing field, to say the least."
"Godzilla may be the headliner, but this is the MUTO's story. Godzilla shows up when needed, and that's about it."
"It dances into Spoofville, then jerks back into straight romantic comedy."
A pretty sorry affair.
"The Extra Man is a comedy, but the humor is so genteel and smug it's as if the movie thinks it would be rude for us to laugh."
Its utter pointless sadism makes the movie unwatchable.
But even a star as bright as Majors&#8217; can&#8217;t shine enough to eclipse just how unapologetically transitional and transactional Ant-Man and the Wasp&#58; Quantumania is&#46;
"A long-winded story, uninspired characters and lackluster off-screen performances."
Detroit is not a movie that cares about the issues tied to ending Black lives; it's a movie that's interested in beating and shooting Black bodies.
By the end I was more bored than frightened.
"Charmless, ugly and lackluster with a laughably bad script, it's no improvement on the original film and on its own merits is just unfortunate. I'm sure the video game tie-in will be more entertaining than this."
Looks like it cost the amount of your monthly Netflix subscription and is as satisfying to watch as it is paying that particular bill.
Important issues buried in soap opera silliness.
"At 92 minutes, Days and Nights feels choppy and hurried, pushing the narrative toward inevitable tragedy rather than exploring how these dispirited people got there."
"Instead of dramatizing this subject’s life, it dramatizes the extravagance of moviemaking."
"Outcast at least has the benefit of a crazy, over-the-top Cage performance that gives this horrendous film a few hilarious moments."
"It's ... a mess. The movie is shot through with curious disconnects. Often within a single sequence of events, we won't know where we are, or how they're related in space or time."
"The underlying historical material for Szkopiak's film is fascinating, but the attempt to mold it into an old-fashioned cinematic thriller proves misguided."
"'Riddick,' the overdue, and largely unwanted, third installment in Diesel's first big film series, is so full of tough-guy overcompensation that it makes the 'Fast and Furious' movies seem like understated character studies by comparison."
"The Rite is an exorcism flick ""inspired by true events,"" which in this case means once upon a time there was a priest."
"""The Happy Prince"" is a frustrating movie that gives us a feel for a decaying personality. But targeting the decline doesn't translate into great cinema."
Becomes full-on parody without even necessarily recognizing it.
"You'd assume a movie called Dog would put an emphasis on the PTSD stricken doggo at the center of the movie, but it ends up becoming more focused on its human counterpart and branches off into some head scratching detours. "
"Dull it is not, but Wong's trademark sense of romantic melancholy fails to jell amid all the excess."
"The Watch perks up when Ayoade's spacey line readings give it something unique and unexpected - otherwise, per Costco, audiences are buying their generic sci-fi comedy in bulk."
"To get the desired effect, you have to see all three films, none of which is much worth seeing by itself."
"Uwais does a lot of his own stunt work, but what could have been an impressive American film debut is utterly blown by Berg's choice to cut the movie as if he was working on the edit while riding a rollercoaster."
"The only part of Call Jane that works is Weaver, who brings a sense of conviction to her role despite the triteness of the material, and makes you wish that her character had been the central character."
It makes you want to reach for a can of Raid.
"Meehl's documentary features plenty of interviews with cowboys and ranch hands who've had their lives changed by Brannaman, but it lacks the literary or cinematic magic of either version of The Horse Whisperer."
"That relationships are, like, hard isn't exactly a revelatory thesis, and most of Andresevic's subjects seem too conscious of the camera -- and prone to post-reality TV empty confession -- to reveal anything beyond the obvious."
Arnold is a very creative director and what she made here in terms of immersion in a world is admirable. It's a shame that one ends up with the tired monotony caused by the movie. [Full review in Spanish]
"A heavyset daughter who never talks but eats a lot is named Delightful, which is supposed to be funny. That pretty much sums up the movie's comic tone."
A sweet movie that fails to make the distinction between old age and death.
The franchise that capitalized on the found-footage craze has gotten lost.
"Designed to be a crowd-pleaser, but after a turbulent, heart-wrenching first act, the second-meant to be touchingly uplifting-instead comes across as rather shallow and pedestrian by comparison."
"The two leads convey some emotionally rich character dynamics, except it's too often compromised by a predictable noir-style storyline that feels contrived."
"Even though DEATH RACE is pretty bloody, and had some cool moments, the overall experience is mind numbing and a little depressing. It's sad to think that this is Anderson's best effort since 2002, and that it's still as bad as ever."
The film exudes a grunge look and a grunge feel while it shifts gears and genres.
The overt use of humour could prove either to be a major hit or miss with audiences as The Predator isn't a name you associate with hearty self-deprecating laughs
There are no characters sufficiently developed to be worth caring about and no suspense in any of the chaotic and badly choreographed battle sequences.
"This movie aspires to generate the kind of rich-people-you-love-to-hate juice of cable TV series such as ""Billions"" and ""Succession."" Ultimately, ""Inheritance"" doesn't even get to the level of ""Dynasty."""
"There's the usual ironic racism, of course, supposed harmlessness due to Old West setting subbing in for supposed harmlessness due to choice of medium."
Remember a time when Eddie Murphy actually used to be funny?
The suffocating level of redundancy on display kneecaps any legitimate chance the film had at embracing social satire.
"The movie is so bad that the lack of laughs, especially from a talent-packed cast like this, is shocking."
"Sadly, it’s a terribly ham-fisted affair; a ragbag of cliches and iffy dialogue, despite some proper star wattage..."
"Au cours des 2 premières minutes de Be Cool, Chili Palmer (John Travolta) affirme qu'il déteste les suites. Ha-ha. Comme si cela excusait le reste du désastre qu'est le film."
"Daniel Day-Lewis's animatronic performance in Spielberg's film underscores how Abraham Lincoln is like E.T., appearing among human beings to make things right before going back to the mysterious place he came from."
"About as funny as a communist food shortage, and just as protracted."
"Ostensibly a political satire with a heart of mush, Joshua Michael Stern hopelessly muddled film cries out for the firm hand of either a dyed-in-the-wool cynic like Billy Wilder."
"A high-octane, brain-dead action picture that happens to feature cops as the characters."
This isn't a movie: it's a police report and the strictly-the-facts terseness of the story makes this more than clear.
"The demonic doll from The Conjuring gets her own unsubtle, repetitive horror flick."
"Despite the farcical set-ups (involving adjoining hotel rooms, private detectives, and a brusque, busybody therapist played with aching exaggeration by Jennifer Aniston), there's very little here that brings the funny."
"For all its visual delights, Magic in the Moonlight, the 44th feature written and directed by the admirably industrious Woody Allen, has to be one of his bigger duds."
"Without charm, lazily directed, acted by the numbers: could make swashbuckling a dirty word."
"There's no fun in this humourless picture, no revealing connections made between the two genres so forcibly yoked together."
"Despite her accomplished cast, French director Anne Fontaine summons neither the dramatic heft nor the humor to put across this absurd forbidden-love scenario."
Muscular but pretty unimaginative.
This is not just for the very young . . . it's for the undiscriminating very young.
A twittering soap opera about five Californian women using Jane as an agony aunt for their love problems.
"Perhaps I'm getting old but at times I found myself thinking the writing was often just mean, lazy or unnecessary."
It's almost as if no one cared to try hard enough to tell a coherent and engaging story.
"Despite the frenetic action scenes, the movie sags, done in by multiple story lines that undercut one another and by the heaviness of its conceit."
"In ideological and moral war, familiarity ... is the state's greatest weapon. It's unfortunate, then, that it's also Judas and the Black Messiah's greatest weakness."
The primary problem with Blue Like Jazz is that there is no believable character development.
The rookie mistakes are legion.
"The fight scenes are routine, the humor juvenile, and the Toronto locales rendered drab through muddy cinematography."
"Even though it's not all Stewart's fault, the other people in the movie are so much more compelling that, much of the time, I wished Snow White would take another nap and let the interesting characters do their stuff."
"In this Hollywood fantasy about a family with 12 kids, nobody does chores, we never see dirty dishes and mom (Bonnie Hunt) is always immaculately groomed, dressed and smiling June Cleaver-style, right down to the tasteful string of pearls."
"The only really jump-inducing bit is a direct rip-off from the first Nightmare film, when Freddy's slimy tongue pokes out at Langenkamp from a phone receiver."
"Part of Mirror's problem is that the screenplay, credited to two writers and with a third getting a story credit, is all over the place."
"Ari comes off as little more than a self-centered, bigoted layabout, contemptuous of anyone who works for a living and a trial to his family."
It's only funny because its putrid dialogue is so unfunny that it drags flies.
"Unless you want a bunch of CGI mice on a mission, there's not much to enjoy in this bland Roald Dahl adaptation."
There isn't one genuine person or moment within sight.
Chernobyl Diaries is a great movie to rent and watch for 85 minutes and then eject the disk before the ending truly ruins it.
"Plays like a vapid spoof of its old self, at once ceaselessly middling, painfully contrived, and so over-the-top that it feels less like a fleet-footed expos of Hollywood culture and more like a lame extended episode of ""The Twilight Zone."""
Ambitious and soaring... [but] there isn't much beyond the show
"While there's lots of great Ceili music on tap, it's wrapped in a story so traditional that it's not especially interesting."
"The director Adam Rifkin wrote this showcase for Mr. Reynolds, who, like Vic, was a college football player. ""The Last Movie Star"" effectively allows the ever-assured actor to score a touchdown on an empty field."
"Essentially a doodle interrupted by nouveau ballet performances, the entire contraption assembled to please the ego of Neve Campbell."
For Luis Buñuel fans and others who don't particularly care if their movies make any sense or have a point or are remotely interesting in any way.
"A tedious story of tormented adultery filmed in black and white, with fixed plans that never end. [Full review in Spanish]"
"What we're left with is a movie that, at times, barely seems to move (it feels like it lasts three hours) and a lead actor who doesn't just look bored, but delivers so many of his lines like he'd rather be anywhere else."
Some filmmakers think they don&apos;t need to develop their characters&#46; They do&#46;
"I don't know about you, but I stopped playing with my cars when I was 10 and you never escape the feeling that the characters in this knackered Nissan of a film have never grown out of messing around with their brrm-brrms."
"Lacking great themes and inner depth, Mongol is just another galloping wondershow of ice blue skies and rocky plains, a light diversion with delusions of grandeur"
"The movie's B-movie flimsiness is pervasive, and paired with an overall lack of B-movie flair, though director Uli Edel makes some game yarn-spinning attempts."
There is a huge plot twist...when it comes it feels like something out of a trashy soap opera... Am I watching a telenovela?
"While never an inherently terrible movie, Bait digs itself a deep grave early on, simply by its own sheer mediocrity in every aspect."
"Neveldine just doesnt have what it takes to make an interesting feature. In fact, this is his worst endeavor to date."
Judge's characters are so one-note and their misadventures so ridiculous that it's hard to get attached to them or care about how they turn out.
"""Breakthrough""... presents itself as the true story of a modern miracle. But it's also a portrait of what religious faith looks like when there's no pesky doubt to get in the way."
George Lucas' desire to suck a few more dollars out of the consumers' pockets has led to a roaring creative misstep.
"There are too many twists in Antoni Stutz's uninvolving ""Rushlights."""
Strange to think that Gyllenhaal's film is based on a true story because the idea of anyone voting for someone as unlikable as Grant seems a stretch.
A Cure for Wellness is a utterly banal and ridiculous visual spectacle. [Full review in Spanish]
"Its self-congratulatory crusade to restore its subject’s reputation has, for the sake of entertainment, distorted reality to the point that it borders on farce."
"...a naked attempt to cash in on the miscellaneous, successful Lego movies."
A movie as inert as its title.
"Maybe if... you spent a lot of time playing with the toys you'd instantly recognize the robots. For the uninitiated, it's merely CGI creatures hitting each other..."
For all the promise it showed&#44; My Animal doesn&#8217;t capitalize on the rich potential of this genre tale and leaves little sense of who its characters are beyond the broad strokes&#46;
"Offers little that is not also explored in current agit-docs like Fahrenheit 9/11, The Corporation, or Outfoxed."
"Kontroll calls itself a thriller, and you will agree if you are excited by scenes of bored inspectors arguing with sullen straphangers."
"Bill Murray evokes a few guffaws in one skit here, but other segments fail to elicit much interest or laughter."
"The film is a thinly dramatized series of arguments against, then ultimately in favor of the medication of bipolar disorder."
"In the bloody muddle ""Triple 9,"" Chiwetel Ejiofor, Anthony Mackie, Woody Harrelson and Kate Winslet manage to make a few scenes count."
"The performances are strong and everybody works hard to establish that his character isn't all good or all bad, but in the end you never quite care."
"Tthe film Gandhi is more stuffy than stately, more prestigious than prodigious. It never quite captures the essence of Gandhi, or the influence he exerted on other leaders, including Martin Luther King. It's a broad but shallow river of information."
As effective as a movie can be and yet still be 100 percent forgettable.
"Before the movie has even really begun, it's already fudging its own premise and undermining its satire."
"Dialogue, shots and scenes are recreated, more for the sake of appearance than for storytelling. It's not wholly fair to compare this movie to the original, but it's unavoidable."
"Strong performances, but a run-of-the-mill sitcom."
"Contagion is certainly the most realistic portrayal of a global pandemic I've seen, but that doesn't make it the most entertaining, or even all that intellectually interesting."
A poor effort with a confusing story and ridiculous plot twist after plot twist.
Perhaps someday French auteurists will be able to figure out how Bad News Bears fits into the cinematic oeuvre of Richard Linklater.
"Instead of gently skewering the conventions of contemporary animation, it simply follows them to a T"
"A virtuoso piece of filmmaking from a technical and visually aesthetic point of view, but Polanski's choice of emotional distance as his mode and the choice of Szpilman as hero combine to make the film a miscalculated disappointment."
"It's too bad that [the movie] misses the mark, because the Rauchs developed a unique character and the movie had some funny moments."
"They aren't caricatures, per se, but in the behavior-reinforcing fashion of simple sitcom, we see an unflattering portrait of brittle, hostile, hustling, neurotic modern suburban control freaks. Who ought to listen to their man, and the Father."
"Plot holes aside, the film seems to justify revenge killing and condone violence, and that cannot be good in this day and age."
"Spiderhead loses steam, circles around the same ideas, and we know what cards they're holding before they get to show their hand. [Full review in Spanish]"
"There is a great, moving story to tell about the real Sam Bloom - but this film only gets part of the way there."
"This is the sort of thing that requires classic Rock, not an experimental but-what-if-I-maybe-acted-like-this-was-Sophie's-Choice? Rock."
"As infectious as Pineda's enthusiasm is, ""Don't Stop Believin' "" too often relies on his inherent appeal as a film subject, rarely probing more deeply than the narrative he and his bandmates provide."
"Much like reality TV, nothing much of consequence happens."
"A well-meaning love letter to ""Ghostbusters,"" and the late Harold Ramis, its embrace is ultimately too reverent, and eventually turns mawkish, even awkward and embarrassing in its final act."
Lee has done the impossible: He's sucked the fun out of call-in sex and replaced it with sanctimonious prattle.
"Sandler's only saving grace with Mr. Deeds may be that the majority of his fans are too young to know of, or just don't care about, Frank Capra or movie masterpieces..."
"A series of conspiratorial talking points familiar to Breitbart-oriented readers, but reshuffled in a new, startlingly illogical order."
"The franchise worsens with each new episode, hitting an all-time low here."
"It's a very sincere work, but it would be better as a diary or documentary."
"Vicious aliens, wicked combat and Tom Cruise charm are all good fun, but what's the point when the story makes no sense?"
A Prairie Home Companion is about as charming as waking up with a dead animal in your bed.
"A rudimentary run-and-gun action thriller, American Assassin does the job in largely workmanlike fashion, save for the surprise sighting of prestige actor Michael Keaton..."
"Ultimately, however, a blockbuster summer film needs to be made like a good sponge cake: equal parts of jokes, action and story and this film for me didn't measure up in all areas."
"All the ingredients are there, yet the final product fails to deliver."
"The Crocodile Dundee movie series is like a good meal that went rotten years ago, then retrieved from the trash, and then served up to people who never asked for this stinking mess in the first place ... Everything about this movie is a colossal mistake."
"Hollywood needs a non-fiction self-help book about how to say no to pitches for adaptations of non-fiction, self-help books. Charismatic actors sadly stuck in an omnibus of a rom-com, aka an omni-rom-com"
The most bloodless and least involving film about turn-of-the-century society since Merchant-Ivory's The Bostonians.
"About the only thing here that will haunt your dreams is the film's final scene, which conveniently portends a sequel."
The quintessential buddy-cop film ... and I don't mean that in a good way.
"Although it's not saying much, this is director Rob Zombie's most impressive outing behind the camera."
"In the 1960s and 70s, violent witch movies offered anti-establishment critiques of fascist witch-hunt intolerance; in 2013, a violent witch movie asks the audience to cheer the torture of suspects and to affirm the slaughter of 'the other' as escapism."
"A slow movie for kids, and an infuriatingly unconvincing one for adults."
"Dev Patel does what he can with this slow burn thriller, but the burn is ultimately far too slow, leading to a dud of an ending."
"Honestly, this movie is rank."
"It's good for a few laughs, and its heart is in the right place. But I never believed a moment of it."
"Directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin deserve credit for not rehashing the basic ideas of their first effort, but they never really expand upon its unique universe either."
Smith's love of long takes where people talk about nothing in particular just isn't right for this movie.
"...[a] hopeless mishmash of, among other things, The Jungle Book, Tarzan, E.T., and King Kong..."
"There's something obnoxious about the way director Jonathan Levine and his screenwriters, Dan Sterling and Liz Hannah, play these two polar opposites against each other."
I love a good romantic comedy that gives me meat and potatoes&#46; But this just gave me a salad&#46; I wanted to enjoy this more but the script&#44; particularly regarding Dre&apos;s character&#44; fell flat for me&#46; 
I'm not sure John Krokidas's lively debut film makes the Beats very likeable - to this reviewer they come across as a gang of spoiled and pretentious young jerks. But that insight (if indeed it is intentional) is not without value.
"Elektra is crap, but it's expensive, finely made crap. It's Faberge crap."
"Those hoping for feature-length doses of Samberg's Lazy Sunday wit will have to settle for just plain lazy, as Hot Rod aims low and still manages to miss its target."
Imagine That is amusing without ever being break-out funny.
"Hardwicke manages to turn it all into a mushy pile of cliches and noise, treating ""Miss Bala"" as her ticket into the Michael Bay School of Fetishistic Violence."
"Without question, it is not the major Hanukkah family classic just waiting to be made."
"It does not reveal too much to say that road leads to something otherworldly, and that the something otherworldly is kind of cute. But considering the whole story rests on it, it's also not all that much to phone home about."
Exists exclusively because its forerunner made a lot of money -- and the lack of inspiration behind the movie shows in every frame.
...there's nothing that stands out so much as to make the film worth recommending.
"Unfortunately, the stilted script and portentous direction make Advantageous, a film written and directed by Asian-American women, a missed opportunity."
The Wolverine represents a strain of faux gravitas that squeezes nearly all the fun out of blockbuster moviemaking. Here we have multimillion-dollar proof that slow and unsure can be just as dull as hyperkinetic chaos.
Ashton Kutcher and Amanda Peet keep the movie on the level of puppy love.
The same overall effect... could be achieved by intercutting Three Stooges shorts with YouTube videos of adorable kittens rolling around with baby bunnies...
A passable feature-length adaptation that does little to burnish the estimable screen legacy of a Dickens classic.
The whole project reeks of vanity.
"One thing becomes abundantly clear. Even if you're 10, it's impossible to hold back a smile while swinging your hips to the merengue."
"The Gambler is a hollow, overwrought and glibly cynical remake of a '70s drama about a self-destructive academic."
Everyone's got demons to deal with -- from Gideon's guilt over a kid that played for him and died under mysterious circumstances to the audience's unwillingness to sit through two hours of yet another inspirational football movie.
"The director goes after both old-media exploitation and new-media omnipresence, and the result is less than cutting."
[It] tries awfully hard. In the end it tries our patience.
What to Expect is a shallow and sickly-sweet offering that's best avoided.
"I love the work that deNiro and Lawrence do here, but ultimately all they do is prove the old adage that you can cover up a lot of problems with the script by hiring good actors."
"Pointless and droll? Definitely, but 'Year One' still has its moments."
The magic is gone without Peter Sellers.
Fails to be a cut above the rest and merely another boring rehash that actually had me praying for a remake...
"There are brave, boundary-breaching movies, and there are mad, foolhardy ones. Harry and Max belongs to the latter breed."
"With every twist of the second-hand plot telegraphed far in advance, you don't need to be clairvoyant to see where this is going."
"Director Tom Holland falls back on the clichs of the genre: the false alarm, the victim backing into the screen, the child in peril, the lone voice of reason in a wilderness of disbelief."
"So THIS is why Sony keeps remaking and rebooting ""Spider-Man."" They haven't a clue how to make ""Venom"" work on the big screen."
The film is a mixed bag with the promise of a better sequel.
"Miscast, lumbering and ugly to look at."
"While this ambitious epic takes a finely cynical attitude toward the excesses of our media-saturated age, it never quite jells into a coherent statement."
"Despite obvious good intentions, this feels dishonest, and I suspect not very true to life. Worst of all, it risks trivialising mental illness into lovable quirks."
The notion of an actor as innocuous as Prinze playing a possible bad guy is a paper thin gimmick.
Poorly developed characters and their relationships turn the momentary thrill of stealing and careening about in hot cars so flat that even Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie cannot put the pedal to the metal.
...it's unclear if the Zellners believe there's a tragic romance in wanting a woman who doesn't want you back or they understand that's just patriarchal BS.
"It dresses up boilerplate horror in a classy shell, yet never gives it the pulse it needs."
...sit back and wonder at a system where a by-the-numbers sequel to a five-year-old effects-driven sci-fi blockbuster is adjudged a sure thing
"feels lazy, bland and ultimately fails to pack a real punch emotionally, dramatically and comedically."
"Arguing that those with different beliefs are evil, corrupt, and aggressively un-American is really the most un-American position one can take."
The movie is at least a bit less annoying than director Alex Proyas&apos; previous two genre attempts&#46;
"An awfully contrived and awkward ""true-life"" drama, film tries desperately to be a crowd-pleaser without delivering the necessary narrative punch or action."
"If you enjoyed the original Sicario, this is a subpar effort on every level, particularly in regards to directing and acting."
(1) why hire an American actress to play a British celebrity icon? (2) why not play up the talent aspect of this character rather than just her quirkiness? The movie is over cute and in parts dull.
"As a director, Chris Rock makes a fine stand-up comic."
"Sadly, Trevorrow's ambitious set-up is betrayed by a filmmaking style that blatantly lacks personality."
It feels like a mean-spirited parody of Annie Hall.
...dull yet hectoring political drama.
The director Philippa Lowthorpe and the screenwriters Rebecca Frayn and Gaby Chiappe are not in the business of letting the audience work things out for themselves.
"It sounds like a fun romp, and it should be a fun romp, but it isn't. Instead, it's tiring and plain silly, without a single plausible character."
Behind Enemy Lines is so effective as chest-beating nationalism you might forgive the filmmakers for offensively turning a Bosnian grave site into a whacky set piece.
"There's not much delightful about Afternoon Delight, an off-putting comedy about a too-idle Los Angeles woman that all of a sudden in the last few minutes decides it wants to be a serious movie."
"It's rather benign, actually -- never very funny, and never amusing for more than a few moments at a time, but not grating or clownish, either."
"After the commanding opulence of Sokurov's better work, this languid trawl through Faust feels like quite the comedown."
Is perfecting the art of middle-of-the-road really what should be applauded in movie making today?
"You find yourself wondering what it was in Truffaut that ever appealed to you. It seemed to be something genuine, and now it seems lost."
It's easy to picture the principal action staged as a more taut and powerful play.
No one wants to see the venerable Dame Helen Mirren get body slammed&#46;
The Protégé has a solid cast at hand but this film leaves a meh (and sometimes creepy) feeling in the all-too-familiar genre.
Contemporary Color verges on cultural satire minus cynicism...This is bread and circuses for hipsters.
"Director Roger Donaldson has made decent thrillers before, but stuck with dud material like this, The November Man is one to forget."
Annabelle needs to go home and retire forever.
"The animation style is appealing and unthreatening, but the film lacks the beguiling magic of The Snowman or the thematic potency of When the Wind Blows."
That Park has talent in the technical department is a given; that he's a good filmmaker is debatable.
I'm sorry to tell you this movie is a mess.
"If this is what bleeding-edge, Oscar-worthy effects work looked like in 1976, it's no wonder that Star Wars made such a gargantuan splash in 1977."
"Barring direct-to-DVD Disney sequels, the first Madagascar was one of the worst animated flicks of all time. The bad news is Escape 2 Africa reunites the same cast and directors that made the first DreamWorks flick such a turkey."
"It's hardly worth seven bucks to see Linnea Quigley, in the flick's wildest scene, thrust a lipstick into her own breast."
"McKay ultimately paints Cheney as a devious, unpredictable sociopath, leaving us more depressed than amused."
"""Exodus"" is an exercise in visual trickery that reaches for nothing beyond the obvious."
"While Anna Faris looks gorgeous and nails her ""dumb blonde with a heart of gold"" persona in most scenes, the rest of 'The House Bunny' hops limply along."
"You might think La Llorona is building to something similar, except...it doesn't. The film builds and builds, but the pay-off feels underwhelming. Perhaps even disappointing."
"Well, they're half right. It's awful."
"As a documentary, Storm Surfers lacks the strong narrative and characters that distinguish..."
"Tone is everything in a movie like this, but writer-director Richard LaGravanese, working from a novel by Cecelia Ahern, can't decide between quirky indie dark comedy and laugh-a-minute TV sitcom."
"Exposing a society where every institution is rank with moral disease, and where the innocent serve out the sentences of the culpable, it's hard to tell whether those involved in this project are horrified by the goings-on or are just exploiting them."
Those of us in the movie audience may find little to cheer in a vehicle that falls short of entertainment.
"Seems ... like a lesser version of what may be Pixar's two weakest efforts, the ""Cars"" movies."
"The issues with the film obviously aren't the star, but in its surroundings full of script problems"
"How sweet it is? Uh, no."
Baumbach's White Noise feels like a collection of the accumulated absurdities that once fired DeLillo’s imagination in a novel that many considered unfilmable. Pehraps they were right. Some things should be left on the page.
"First-time director, Janusz Kaminski, a well-known cinematographer, was very focused on the images of the film, perhaps at the cost of such things as story and character development."
"Director Ivan Reitman jazzes the talky proceedings up with split screens and transitions galore, but it's still just a minor-league Moneyball."
"Tim Burton's new live-action remake of ""Dumbo"" eliminates too many of the beloved elements of the original classic for a relentlessly gloomy endeavor that's way too sad for its intended child audience."
A hollow and tasteless charade. [full review in Spanish]
"'Dogs, vampires....my miserable life would be so much less complicated if I were ugly or maybe French,' exclaims Bella."
"There is an age above which this movie is unnecessary, and it may be in the low double digits."
"Much of Annette feels shockingly inert, a series of undernourished or otherwise underwhelming ideas strung together only by Carax's occasionally fevered mise en scene."
"It owes a lot to Inside Out...but I'm reminded of the aphorism: Good artists copy, great artists steal. Maybe Wonder Park should've stolen more and been less of a wide-eyed imitation. It's sweet but it's not satisfying."
"Imagine an Elmore Leonard movie scripted by a bad Nora Ephron imitator, and you'll have an idea of how dead-in-the-Jersey-water it is."
"""Pitch Perfect 2"" is a predictable repeat of the original with updated music, dance, and competition."
"so misconceived on every level, it's almost fascinating to watch. If you don't mind pain, that is. This movie knows how to make you hurt..."
A lame showcase for DeNiro's monotonous blankness and the hysterics of Fanning.
Teresa Palmer is disappointingly under-powered as the daughter.
"""Something about Mary"" seems a lifetime ago."
The film isn&#8217;t even a testament to &#91;Witherspoon and Kutcher&apos;s&#93; talent or charm as actors&#59; the material they&#8217;re working with was simply too weak for them to salvage&#46;
"Impostor can't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels, fight off various anonymous attackers, and evade elaborate surveillance technologies."
"Instead of inspiring geniuses, Iraq war backlash has only resulted in snarky self-righteousness that -- from Charlie Wilson's War and now British import In the Loop -- has demonstrated the low ebb of modern comedy."
"The problem isn't that Diaz's character is such a mean-spirited person, it's that her motives for being that way are completely contrived.It might have been a good short film, but that's about it."
"The obvious solution (to the age thing) would've been to repurpose this as a iHiding Outi remake, with Platt reprising the Jon Cryer role as an adult masquerading among teenagers."
A loose-knit coming-of-age tale for which perhaps the best word is baffling...
Aged cliches and gimmicks vie with fresh ideas for supremacy in The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys; the outcome at best is a draw.
"While the film's behind-the-scenes look into the world of Washington bureaucracy is appealing, the movie is a complete letdown as a thriller, dissolving into implausible silliness."
Few romantic comedies are as obnoxiously erratic&#46;
A romantic comedy is supposed to be fanciful and fun. This is neither. Nor is it sexy.
"""Infamous""' powerhouse casting doesn't add much, since most of the big names -- Sigourney Weaver, Gwyneth Paltrow, Isabella Rossellini, Hope Davis, Juliet Stevenson, and director Peter Bogdanovich -- serve as little more than window dressing."
Robert Zemeckis' creepy remake is not as bewitching as it should be.
"The action grows wearisome as it grinds on, and the film becomes a succession of dazzling set pieces devoid of simple feelings."
Random Hearts is disappointing mostly because it didn't have to get this absurd.
"To say that Campion's work is bad would be unfair and impartial, it is more apt to say that it is a mediocre film dressed as one of those larger than life films. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"The script barely acknowledges the apparent contradiction between their adorable innocence and their vocation of evil sycophancy, much less milk it for satire."
"It is sadistically brutal, based on a fault of logic or a warped moral code or both, and, get this, it is rated PG."
"The story is based on real incidents, but the uplifting tone is laid on so thick that it's difficult to believe a minute of it."
"Had [Guava Island] embraced more of the mysticism introduced in its prologue, it may have been the kind of oddity it's striving to be."
"""Casino Jack"" is glib, fast-paced entertainment that barely leaves a mark - which, given the subject, is just plain wrong."
"Silva attempts to stoke social commentary within a raucous portrait of male camaraderie, however, he's uninterested in delivering any sort of impactful poignancy."
"Less talk. More head spinning. These are the charges against The Exorcism of Emily Rose, which delivers some creepy moments but only after endless scenes of courtroom wrangling."
"There's no story here, only a one-sided shoot-em-up as callous as a video game. Hollywood has always been cynical, but Desierto distinguishes itself by its indifference to the dilemma it depicts."
entertaining misfire
"You know things are bad when the most interesting character, the menacing brute Bill Sykes, is never heard or seen on-screen."
"A sequel as desperate, in its own ""official"" way, as the knockoff-brand origin story that previously besmirched the franchise name."
"Quite the opposite of the great earlier film, the Oz here is a dull place to be. Given the choice, you might even consider going back to Kansas."
This listless biopic of the famed 1950s model is as timid and tame as her photos seem today.
"Is it really ""a tragedy"" that lots more people will get to see these paintings?"
A mission that should have been aborted long ago.
"The metallic tang of blood is all over the elegant facade of this mysteriously disappointing, dispassionately underpowered story..."
As pretentious as its convoluted title.
"It's not exactly satirical news that the culture of big business is dog-eat-dog, but you're more likely to wince at the cruelty in Billy Wilder's The Apartment than at the body-count ethos here."
Luther&#58; The Fallen Sun&#8221; has all the earmarks we established on the BBC television series&#44; but this time around feels as rumpled as Luther&#8217;s famous grey wool jacket&#46;
"Beautifully composed as the film is, it borders on preciousness."
A highly irresponsible film... [Full Review in Spanish]

"If you hate movies, and you find sexual assault funny, ""The Human Centipede III: Final Sequence"" should meet your needs."
Reg Traviss's overlong thriller spews out clichs from the off.

It is a painfully minimalist film that&apos;s as uninspired and flavorless as the cheese squares that they leave out at her sculpture exhibition&#46;
"This historical drama is more concerned with showing tawdry sex, convoluted conspiracies and surprisingly violent killings than it is with telling the real story."
"Most of it is indistinguishable from the rest, just as the film itself will eventually blend with your memories of other chapters in the Transformers series."
"Scott's take on the importance of family is an admirable one, to a point, until it moves past that to espouse an uncomfortably regressive morality."
"To say that ""Tomorrowland"" is a disappointment isn't really fair. If this reviewer was eight years old, it would seem like one of the best movies ever."
"Kind and communicative, but seldom profound, never adding up to anything distinct."
"A promise is a promise, or at least it ought to be. But despite its title, Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter shows no signs of being the last in its none-too-illustrious line."
Fail State's revealing examination of the broken financial aid system is undercut by a stale and scattered presentation.
Runaway trains have enough to do in The Lone Ranger without being asked to serve as the defining symbol of this movie... bloated by a reported $250 million budget to a saddle-sore running time of two and a half hours.
For every shining moment&#44; there are others that range from head-scratching to unnecessarily wrong&#46;
"The Reader isn't an act of moral imbecility like The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, but it's pretty questionable all the way through."
"The Stooges themselves often had trouble sustaining their breezy brutality for 90 minutes, leaving the Farrellys out of ideas early on, resorting to fart jokes to nab laughs."
"Perhaps if the romantic drama were more convincing instead of merely looking like handsome photo ops of pretty people filmed against blazing skies, the film might carry more weight."
"I'm now officially done caring whether Michael Cera loses his virginity. So, it seems in this hit-and-miss comedy, is Cera."
"The Haunted Mansion is well made and acted with a kind of campy glee, but it doesn't scare up enough thrills or laughs to give it the kind of mass appeal of Disney's summer blockbuster Pirates of the Caribbean."
"Director John Crowley should apologize to his cast, especially the underrated Eric Bana and Rebecca Hall, for mismanaging this story. What could have been an exciting international thriller is instead a head-shaking, poorly-executed bomb."
"Features a story so convoluted, audience members should be given a bag of breadcrumbs upon entry, so as to leave a trail through the logic."
Josh Hartnett sleepwalks.
"Winslet has ... powerful scenes, especially a visceral one near the end that dives into her harried history. It, however, is not enough to keep A Little Chaos in order."
An uneven but provocative drama.
A pale Pink Panther.
"'Bullitt' is still remembered after 40 years for its car chase that only lasted 10 minutes. 'Getaway' is a 90 minute car chase and it will be forgotten by the end of the year, if not sooner."
"It's a brutal film, a black comedy with emphasis on character, but it hopes to be more than just B-movie mischief, rendering the whole picture fruitless with uncomfortable regularity."
"[Zaillian] has made a movie about monsters, not men, and in 2006, it's the men we most need to fear."
Lurid drama that goes to ridiculously great lengths to draw its sad and tawdry picture.
Although it lacks originality it plays a little better than the silly title suggests.
"This demon-possession horror movie has enough good moments that it's a shame the filmmakers didn't try harder; for every effectively moody scene, there's another that's lazy, twitchy, or shopworn."
"While the ensemble from Boyz 'N the Hood felt trapped by their environment, Jody is just lazy and callow."
"It's soapy melodrama with the fun dampened by ""verisimilitude"" - a Marvel-movie treatment for the book-club set."
It all feels terribly feeble and no matter how energetic and broad the comedy mugging of Diaz and an ill-looking Segel it rarely raises a laugh. What a right old Carry On.

The movie's as sexist as can be.
The problem is that we've seen it all before and usually more lucidly and convincingly.
It&#8217;s damning with faint praise to call this the best Jurassic movie since the original&#44; but that doesn&#8217;t mean this one&#8217;s not&#44; much like its predecessors&#44; a hot mess&#46; It&#8217;s just a hot mess with some effectively scary bits&#44; a cool car chase and Laura Dern&#46;

a drag-down bore
"Unfortunately the child actors aren't particularly engaging, and the gags aren't entirely fresh."

Viewing the film is as disagreeable as is its distressing story.
"Blumhouse Productions has codified its horror template to the point that their films are the cinematic equivalent of blues ... you will hear the same 12-bar chord progression, hitting the same beats..."
"It's not clear whether ""The 9th Life of Louis Drax"" is deliberately inconsistent or merely an example of confused filmmaking. One thing is certain, however: It sure leaves an unpleasant aftertaste."

There's more drama in a breakfast cereal ad.
"THERE'LL likely be more Z's in the audience than on the screen during The Legend of Zorro, a belated and belabored sequel to the delightful '98 hit that seems more like a cross between Wild Wild West and Spy Kids."
"It does take a little while for Kasdan's adaptation to completely fall apart, so there are some decent shakes and scares along the way -- but nowhere near enough to make for a satisfying moviegoing experience."
"Zero Charisma is a comedy by classification, but its cruelties have a way of turning it into a psychodrama inadvertently. The tone is often as abrasive as its hero."
"With awkward slow-motion effects, clunky transitions and pregnant zooms that seem conspicuously in the wrong speed or otherwise a little off, Mr. Oliver's film aims for a glossy mainstream aesthetic without the budget or skills to match."
"Despite amazing CGI that shows Cotillard convincingly sans legs and terrific acting, this is far too long for what's there."
The movie has a lot of great scenery but gets a little boring along the way with too much time spent on the dust and their continual riding with a view of their backs.
"A ghostly thriller that's all plot, no emotion and thrill-free, despite the presence of Belle Thorne, the hardest working woman in show business."
"Kingdom of Heaven lands somewhere between Oliver Stone's yawn-inducing Alexander and Troy, the Brad Pitt pecs flexer, as sand-and-sandal entertainment."
"Despite its hints of New Age mysticism and serviceable performances from an able cast, Touchy Feely is too entrenched in its dour tone to be uplifting."
This third go-round won't make Twihard converts of the rest of us.

"Jason Segel and Robert Redford face off in soggy, cerebral sci-fi drama."
"A film about Malena herself, her travails, the deep-reaching conclusion, would have been much more interesting and original, but Tornatore is mired in cliches."
"Surely they can't be serious. This is so bad it must be camp. Under heavy pancake makeup, Sharon Stone gives a bad Mae West imitation, a performance not to be missed by any camp-follower"

"If you were a fan of David Cronenberg's Crash, you might just be the target audience for Quid Pro Quo, a perverse psychological drama about able-bodied people who yearn to become disabled."
"Attempting to alleviate the sense of crushing, overwhelming tedium with flashy visuals and stylish action sequences, when they're this few and far between, is like giving CPR to a corpse."
"Why did this movie leave such a rotten taste in my mouth? Because its story, based on Emily Giffin's popular novel, is a pretty repellent view of women's friendship."

"Nothing is bleaker than failed black comedy, which this is."

"In her attempts to poke fun at the cult of celebrity, [Coppola]'s perhaps forgotten to allow us a character to truly identify with."

It feels like it secretly wants to be a Iraq vet version [ of Y tu Mama Tambien] but is afraid to go there.

Think Freak Friday with F-bombs.
"It is not a terrible movie, and Stallone has appeared in far worse. It's just that, although diverting, it's too routine for its own good."
"""Choose or Die"" is a flawed film, but one not without merit...watchable, thanks to its brisk pace and intriguing central concept, but the uneven execution leaves you wondering if perhaps the filmmakers should have just pressed reset."
"It's not much more than a variation on Nine to Five, with the object of revenge switched from a single boss to multiple husbands."
"The performances are endearing enough, the pacing is actually quite crisp and there is no shortage of zany silliness in the story. It just never gels."
The film looks for an emotional payoff by continually upping the stakes of its main character's self-destructive short-term thinking.
"It's not awful, but it feels tired, like it's just another in a long line of cookie-cutter movies about pretty people."
"A boy's adventure story that has mistaken itself for an epic, and it rattles around in its own ambitions like a child's head in a 10-gallon hat."
"Moore lacks the off-kilter psychological nuances of Lynch, as well as the go-for-broke storytelling skills and visual lan. It doesn't help that the cast is largely competent at best."
[An] excruciatingly unfunny live-action comedy.
"The results are supposed to be funny, but are instead painful."
"Simply can't wring suspense from a scenario that ends up isolating the murderers from their murderees on either side of a locked door for a long, dull section of the film."

"Isn't the stuff of bondage and discipline, sexual role play, silky blindfolds, and whips and floggers supposed to be, well, exciting?"
"Ridley Scott's biblical epic ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" is by turns fascinating and infuriating, exciting and tedious, head-scratching and inspiring."

"Michael Moore wants to rally emotional support for a political revolution, but as always, he cares more about stunts than policy details."
"In the Heart of the Sea is a technical marvel, demonstrating that Howard is still a master of making movies look and sound stunning. Unfortunately, the screenplay was lost at sea."
"The script by Michael Brandt and Derek Haas strains credulity -to say the least! -- but if nothing else, it manages to work in all the obligatory heist movie cliches."
I don't think it's particularly funny and I think that's the problem with the film. I think it wants to be funny.

It's a sweet story sabotaged by routine characters and dumb plot turns.
This tale of a KKK president seeing the error of his ways-and bonding with a civil-right activist-feels all kinds of wrong.
They rather miss the point that Doillon presents Rodin and Claudel's relationship as a piece of beautiful marble that is slowly hewn away... Worse than the movie's so-called plodding-ness is its talkiness
"Sometimes a good idea, a lot of enthusiasm and a shoestring budget just aren't enough."
"Cancer kids and schoolgirl sex abuse aren't usually thought to be the stuff of mirth, and yet some people sitting behind me at a screening of this were barking like seals."
"Somewhere in here, there's a remarkable film about an absent father trying to make good with a daughter who never loses faith. Unfortunately, that film is submerged by Cahill's distracted approach to make the film 'palatable'."
A campy hot mess.
"Not only is this film persistently unfunny, but it is consistently uninvolving."
"According to the Ferrell method, the art of comedy characterisation is to put on a straight face (daft hairstyle optional), bellow the first thing that comes to mind (rude words optional), race around like a child on a sugar rush... and repeat."
"""Motocross is our life."" So begins the saga of the brothers Carlyle."
Jeremy O'Keefe directs a tonally all-over-the-place drama that fails to convince.

The fatal flaw of War ... is that I don't give two craps about anyone in it.

Home Team is The Waterboy without the charm or Henry Winkler&#46;
Plays like a game of YA mad libs gone horribly wrong.
"Since nothing about the film is taken seriously, there's a bit of fun to be had with the exaggerated makeup effects, pervasive sarcasm, and kung fu combat."
"The writing is hack, sounding more like an anonymous internet comment than how people actually speak to one another. This poorly-written script crumbles under the smallest amount of pressure."
"Amounts to a bunch of clever stuff uselessly circling a void; a superhero comedy without compelling heroes, villains, or subtext."
The biggest neuron killer since tertiary syphilis. [Full review in Portuguese.]

"[A] bombastic, incoherent, though occasionally eloquent period epic co-directed by Jackie Chan and Zhang Li."
Overstuffed with characters and contrivances.
"In the movie’s early nod to the director John Hughes, “Hello, Goodbye and Everything In Between” set a high bar, one it has the talent but not the boldness to clear."
"Some of these scary figures march in jaunty-out-of-joint step as if they've emerged from ""Thriller"" (if only Vincent Price might have provided voiceover explanations)."
"For a movie that's all about embracing life wholeheartedly, Life as a House sure does a good job of keeping its actors in check."
"The tone shifts as unpredictably as the soundtrack, which goes from a bang to a whisper and back again for no apparent reason."

Jennifer Lopez has to suffer through it all in the name of $10 million a picture

"If you're looking for a mindless, fun summer flick, check this one out. Otherwise, it's okay to pass this one by in the video store."
"Any trip to this area of the globe is worth the journey, but for all of the warning and dire passages of the story, there's no sustained sting of reaction, with much of the worry communicated here equaling white noise."
"This boring rehash has not one decent scare, its most unforgivable trait."
Ferrell is to the sports comedy what the Toronto Maple Leafs are to the hockey biz: Hard-core fans are sure to show up and find reasons to be amused. The rest of us can only hope for better days.
"The more we see of these werewolves, the more we notice that they come in two flavors: conflicted moping (played by Agnes Bruckner) and fey Eurotrash (played by everyone else)."
"What might have been a tight two-hander steeped in grief-driven suspicion is, in the hands of director Eran Riklis, regrettably a slick, low-wattage affair."
This one's strictly for the dogs.
A good idea and good acting are ruined by a craven Hollywood Ending.
A Christmas lump of coal.
"Everything proceeds in bog-standard, romantic movie-epic fashion."
Annoyingly twee.
Predictable and shallow. Something precious has been lost in the translation from the stage to the big screen.
"The pop-art auteur's least-focused film to date, a rambling wreck of shrewd ideas and cinematic influences that never interlock into their own identifiable movie."
A jumble of bad movie cliches strung together into an overly simplistic tale of a pooch who gets in trouble over candy.
a Walter Mitty approach to justify the decadent and pathetic life of Charlie Sheen
"Best viewed on the largest screen with the best sound system possible, but it still feels like there could be more to this that isn't being explored or pondered."
"There are one or two lively moments, and the famous jabbing piano music is always triggering in a good way, but this is a film with a great big kitchen knife deeply inserted into each vital organ."
"Neither sufficiently funny to work fully as comedy, nor emotionally involving enough to succeed as a drama, the movie is one of Allen's blander efforts ( ... )"

The film merely winds up being just another depressing exercise that confuses faulty plotting and icky visuals with intelligent filmmaking.

While there is certainly a flashiness to The Great Wall -- particularly expressed through a series of large-scale action sequences -- the most accurate adjective available to describe the blockbuster is dull.
"Laughs are a matter of taste, I suppose. For me, Late Night provided intermittent amusement until it reaches its predictably affirming conclusion. So, another movie in which promise exceeds fulfillment? For me, yes."
"Wobbly and foundering or, as one young commando observes, 'We're living 'Call of Duty' - and it sucks!'"
Point Break? More like Point Miss.
An incoherent mess...
A hollow replica of its source material.
"Clunk, clunk, squish. That is the sound of the dead language in Roland Joff's screenplay for ""There Be Dragons"" as it tramples his would-be epic of the Spanish Civil War into an indigestible pulp."

"Nanny Diaries, through a failure of either verve or nerve, stumbles almost as awkwardly as its heroine does into her child-minder gig."
"It does give a sense of disturbance, but after a while it gets irritating, as much of it is repetitive without either developing the story or adding significance."
"A shoddy opening, an intriguing middle, and a deflated conclusion. 'Snake Eyes' is as mixed a bag as they come."
Emmerich and Devlin seem to have created a new subgenre: Generic Destruction.
...ultimately just not able to live up to its inexplicable reputation as a minor cult classic.
"If it wasn't for the great cast, this film would've been better profiled for direct to video and DVD. [Full review in Spanish]"

One suspects the perpetrators of this cinematic crime spent Valentine's Day alone.
The worst use of a Skynrd song since Karaoke Night at Hooters.

The dance has to be good because the rest of the movie is one long cliche.
"Playing the funny friend, Kevin Hart stands out--a welcome relief from the low-simmering, Promise Keeper-esque ethos that fuels this piece."
"It's watchable and fluent, but there is something narcissistic and conceited in Moretti's performance."

"If it's a Funny or Die movie, where's the ""die"" button?"
A poor imitation of a screwball comedy.
Screenwriters Jake Crane and Jonathan A. H. Stewart seem to be content to trot out the usual war picture platitudes with stiff dialogue that has all the personality of an instruction manual.
"Mr. Canterbury's character is a Hollywood child archetype: wan and withdrawn, all monosyllables and needy stares."
"Hanna starts out edgy and fresh, but runs out of steam and imagination, ending up, after many obligatory chases, in the same old place."

A heart-on-sleeve weepie which takes extraordinary liberties with the truth to fashion a conventional Hollywood narrative.
"Not a lot of entertainment with this edification. It's thought-provoking, but so's CNN."
"Moore is an actress of limited range whose solemnity and strength of character are her greatest assets, so it's distressing that first-time screenwriters Derek Guiley and David Schneiderman present Anna as a whiny damsel in distress."
Klaus Menzel's laughable screenplay is not enhanced by direction not much more accomplished than that of a typical Cinemax late-night adult series.
"Before I Disappear is ultimately hampered not by a messy plot but by bland characters who, for the most part, don't so much talk to each other as they monologue at each other."

The Operative is a bland and convoluted affair that struggles to keep the audience engaged and leaves minimal impact during its runtime.

Doctor Strange In The Multiverse of Madness is visually imaginative but underwhelming&#46;
"When a movie has to spend almost two hours trying and failing to justify a ridiculous premise, someone really wanted to get it made. Those watching on Peacock will be wondering who. And why. And how."
The drama that Shyamalan pursues is how reasonable and well-intentioned people can and should respond to possessed destroyers who hold them hostage. The movie’s answer is a sickening one.

"Lessovitz is an outsider to the ball scene, and it shows."
[The film] makes a fine enough contribution to the pantheon of films about terminal illness ... but it's ultimately only enough to leave audiences wishing that there were more.
"Cumming is well-suited to this kind of material, but Kennedy, while decent as a henpecked husband, is unbelievably awful when he dons the green face-paint."
"Just like Up, the first 20 minutes is the best part, and that's about where the comparisons stop. They had the pieces in place for The Proposal but it slowly fell apart."
A historical epic totally destroyed by the infusion of contemporary political correctness and left-wing revisionist history.
"Thornton, Bates and Cox give their all to the misanthropic dialogue, but they're spewing bile without a safety net. Bad Santa is one Christmas classic that should have been left well alone."

"The movie's various subplots, flashbacks and hallucinations are tripping all over each other."
"Primarily to blame for this mess is the leaden script by Kevin Falls and John Gatins, which absorbs a bushel of baseball clichs while demonstrating a singular inability to present love, sex or even bawdy jokes."
"Not a ""zing"" in this thing, though it is striking to look at."
A shallow look at suburban America.
"It would be one thing if W.E. were strictly a swooning counterpoint to Speech's scowling dismissal of Wallis and Edward's relationship, an embellishment of an already notorious romance rather than a twice-lathered soap opera."
"Just about everything in this instantly forgettable but intermittently funny movie could be summed up as ""no better and no worse."""
"""Friend Request"" is less insightful than a tossed off status update. Request denied."
"But with such timely material and a stellar cast, it comes off mostly as a missed opportunity."
"Political comedy morphs into attempted thriller in this confused, fitfully entertaining film."
Did I mention the dinosaur? Dinosaur.
"The players struggle to inject emotion into the bookish, period-specific dialogue, which often results in clunky, stilted exchanges."
"With ""Jurassic Park III"" Johnston inherits the series one film too late. There are only so many ways a dinosaur can chase people through a jungle."
This sequel unintentionally offers some worthwhile advice in its title.
Seek out the infinitely superior The Myth of the American Sleepover for an original and moving take on similar material.
"A rather pedestrian film, epic in length but curiously pinched in scope."
"Think of it like an appendix to your favorite book. It's a fun movie, but only because of its subject matter and characters. It can't stand on its own."
"Nothing is really new or improved, only amplified."
"Movie characters don't have to be nice, but they do need to be interesting. Nastiness without intrigue translates, in whatever language, to 'annoying.'"
"Home Again doesn't seem to be particularly concerned with story development - probably a fifth of the movie is made up of montages, all jaunty music and well-lit actors more fitting in a sunscreen commercial."
"'Gorgeously decadent, massively contrived, and gloriously superficial.'"
"Any hint of narrative complexity or character development is wiped out by the film's slavishly straightforward storyline, and its special effects that might be state-of-the-art but never show anything we haven't seen before."
The Upside adds itself to a long list of films that Hollywood remakes and fails to emulate. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Taylor isn't able to believably blend the overlapping perspectives and The Girl on the Train comes across as a flat, predictable puzzle whose characters flip from one extreme to another."
"Venom is neither triumph nor train-wreck. It's a mediocre origin story, a superhero host that sadly fails to bond with its comedy parasite."
"There's just not much of real import in this quasi-historical semi-thriller. It uses [Josef] Mengele as a mystery to be solved, then makes him a flaccid bogeyman, but never finds a good reason to observe him in exile."
Horror-movie protagonists should know better than to make wishes on mysterious ancient artifacts.
Stallone keeps his end of the bargain&#46; It&#8217;s the nihilistically grungy backdrop that sticks in the craw&#46;
"I wish I could say 99 Homes delivers a shockingly good sucker punch to the American electorate and a stand-up-and-cheer piece of socially conscious filmmaking, but it's not."
"The Promise isn't so much a film with a cohesive, engaging story but instead bullet points on the drawing board for a film that never moved past its origin."
I did not know that mannequins in Manhattan store windows could actually talk. I did not find their performance in the least wooden.
"The writers and director can't craft a convincing plot and show little understanding of how Congress works; they have no idea where to take the characters, so they transform everyone into low-camp buffoons."
"[Its] randomly flung-in episodes are just quirky padding around a thin, one-twist story."
"Like its perpetually baked main character, this stoner comedy has trouble figuring out a direction, with a plot that lurches haphazardly in various directions before settling on an incongruously high-stakes set piece for its final act."
"Superficial, unimaginative and inert. The so-called heroes are pompous, one-note caricatures who have the depth of gnats, and are just as irritating."
"The movie it's in isn't wonderful, but Moore always is."
…the only thing these Oscar-ized actors are looking for is a paycheck. [Full review in Spanish]
"PETA members may take to The Shaggy Dog. Everyone else over the age of 10, however, will likely prefer a night of sniffing butts to this latest Tim Allen stinker."
Chimps could have made a better movie.
It's a misnomer to label the climax of Steven C. Miller's patently sick Arsenal an actual climax.
"In Days of Thunder, Tom Cruise tries to do for NASCAR racing what he did for bartending in Cocktail. Which is to say: Nothing."
"The only participant to emerge with its reputation intact--though not its paint job--is the Shelby Mustang muscle car, which also delivers the film's most nuanced and psychologically complex performance."
Its tongue is planted too far in its cheek and it can't decide whether it wants to be serious or silly.
It's a cynical attempt to plunder your wallet with broad buffoonery you can see for free on TV.
So much truculence does little good for a story for whom the most of its appeal lies in its ambiguity. [Full review in Spanish]
"[A] crass, trashy and none-too-funny comedy."
Angels in the Dust is a troubling documentary for obvious reasons...but it's also a bit disturbing for reasons director Louise Hogarth may not have noticed.
"Not only does this lowest-common denominator conclusion backfire, it insults anyone who invested their time getting involved in the whole thing."
"Caso o roteirista deste filme morra, por favor, não o enterre no cemitério indígena visto na história."

One of those films where if you've seen the trailer then you've seen all the jokes.
"When lists of the 10 worst movies of 2006 start coming out, you'll know it's been a truly abominable year if Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector doesn't rate a slot near the top."
"Dirty Love is ninety mintes of soul-crushing idiocy, wrapped in incompetence and smothered in fart jokes."
"Overmarketed and undercooked, Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde rehashes everything that was fun and fresh in its predecessor to such bland effect."
"Can't quite decide what kind of weird it wants to be: a loopy B-movie corkscrew ride, or an American Beauty-style suburban burlesque with Something To Say."
"Like an anti-Frost/Nixon, there's a ton of build up and no pay-off."
It's a dog.
"A feast for the eyes and a history buff's dream, but not a cinephile's."
Spiral: From the Book of Saw is a mixed bag of gruesomely bloody tricks.
"Were it not for its title, this plodding, tiresome mess would have never seen the light of day."
"Some may think the metaphoric possibilities of an incurable illness that can be transmitted through sexual contact have been all but exhausted. Director André Téchiné almost proves otherwise in The Witnesses, a kind of film opera without music."
"The movie is smarter than you would think, but it ultimately succumbs to the recent trend of going for overly raunchy cheap gags for laughs."
"The teenage boys say 'ewww' and the teenage girls say 'awww,' and you've recouped your $8 million in no time."
"Unfortunately, as good as the animation is, it never quite manages to bring any of the characters to life and the film fails to connect on an emotional level as a result."
"When you run the equation that made Pixels into a feature -- a 3-minute short about 8-bit creatures times 90 minutes and divided by a 2-bit script -- it's us who are on the losing side of this loud, boring game thanks to Sandler's smug smirk."
"Nothing wrong with an unashamedly sentimental holiday flick, but there's no excuse for these nails-on-a-chalkboard characters and manipulative heartstring yanking."
"The Contractor is as generic and dull as its title, with an over-used action-movie plot of a bitter military veteran who goes rogue. Throw in some 'daddy issues,' sloppy editing, and a drab Chris Pine -- and that sums up this soulless film."
"A few unexpected twists towards the end, and the work of its top-notch cast... simply aren't enough."
"It's a relief to see Williams underplaying for a change and letting us fill in the blanks, but the movie's suggestiveness gives way to a certain thinness and lassitude."
"For all its transient black-and-white beauties, denies its subject the sort of solid context that would reveal the scale of her achievements. A patchy, frustrating, though loving tribute."
"Brian De Palma spent three years struggling to get The Black Dahlia made, which helps explain why the movie has the feel of something that was left in the oven too long: It's both overcooked and undernourishing."
I'm a total cinematic masochist... but 90 or so minutes of emotional hammering and being reminded of our fragility and imminent demise is a bit much.
An inane romantic comedy that makes you wonder if the Writers Guild hasn't already gone on strike.
...suffers from an often unwatchable first half that admittedly does give way to a passable final stretch...
Oh Lordy.
"You could read meaning into this if you like, but it wouldn't be wise to seek other than a certain visual panache and a jokey determination at all costs to surprise."
It tried to be National Treasure and it failed.
"For a while, the cast is appealing enough, and the design is House Beautiful enough, to camouflage the Fatal flaws that turn the second half into an overblown, predictable snicker-fest."
"Like so many recent thrillers of this ilk, many of them in some way exploiting the 'innocence' of childhood -- the dumb and unpleasant Hide and Seek springs to mind -- Dark Water falls apart in the wind-down."
It all just panders too much.
Tomb Raider is a step in a the right direction for a genre desperately needing a turn-in critical performance&#46; While nothing to boast about with 34 films in the genre thus far&#44; the 50 percent rating on rotten tomatoes moves the needle up&#46;
"Despite a superficially eco-friendly message and an engaging female lead, it's bogged down by a formulaic story and an over-reliance on celebrity voice talent."
The film comprises 20 per cent boring plot talk and 80 per cent even more boring action.
There was a feeling of doom that enveloped the original... Coppola fails to find that same energy and any connection to the war being waged outside the walls is vague at best.
Some scripts should never be made into movies. This is one of them.
"[Director Scott Derrickson] arrives well-equipped with an intuitive sense of genre-specific trickery, yet this heavily derivative psychological horror ultimately fails to add depth and character to a disappointing mélange of predictable jumps and scares."
By the end of The Walker a movie that begins as a dazzling round of charades has deteriorated into a plodding game of Clue.
A total bomb.
"Poorly written, directed, performed, and edited, ""Bad Cupid"" is a Bad Movie."
"Our Brand is Crisis would have an uphill battle on its hands even if it were a masterpiece, which it most certainly is not."
A ponderous snooze with more pregnant pauses than a season's worth of Harold Pinter revivals.
It's a sequel to skip.
Billie Holiday's life was filled with so much tragedy and triumph that it must count as some sort of accomplishment to make a boring movie about her.
One For The Money is a paint-by-numbers chick-flick that'll make you laugh a few times but won't particularly enamour.
A formulaic indie comedy that's as stale and familiar as the network sitcom that its writer/director currently stars in.
"Endorses the notion of blind faith, and denial as a positive character trait."
&#10;Despite its vivid&#44; colourful aesthetic and appeal to those of a younger age&#44; The Super Mario Bros&#46; Movie is devoid of the panache and cleverness of previous Illumination efforts and&#44; most importantly&#44; the games themselves&#46; 
There is nothing particularly clever or twisty about it as a thriller.
"full of attractive, listless actors who apparently couldn't get jobs on any of the WB's teen soap operas striking poses and mouthing dusty dialogue."
Tthis one comes off as an amateurish misstep due to unoriginal storytelling from fledgling screenwriters Michael and Shawn Rasmussen.
...a worthy experiment that might enchant younger viewers but could bore older ones.
"A more pointless film I haven't seen this year. Aimless and meandering, thin and bodyless, banal and ingenuous -- it makes you ask how Ramsay once made a film as good as Ratcatcher."
"His handheld cameras dodge and weave, but that's all they do. Good handheld requires stealth craft; this is just someone flailing with a camera in their hands."
Only slightly more stirring than a Wikipedia entry.
You know something is amiss when the spiky-haired dominatrix is a more relatable character than the movie's ostensible leading lady.
I keep renting Jean Reno films and I'm beginning to forget why I started doing so.
"It turns all of the characters into chess pieces, whose relationships depend on the plot, not on human chemistry. Since the plot is absurdly illogical, you're not left with much."
"It is a gigantic, perverse admission of defeat."
"Caylan's utter minimalism leaves one with the feeling, mostly, of frosty dispassion."
It managed to take what started out as an interesting franchise and ruin it.
"For all its analogies to Afghanistan, Iraq, Vietnam, or wherever, the underlying thrust of Centurion is its celebration of bloodlust."
"Here, it's all about the people who are fighting, not about what they're fighting for, and nobody seems to care about justice or freedom."

"Though the background of this film is carefully done, and direction and acting good, it is a sordid and dreary affair."
This intriguing record soon hits flat notes ... when it's not needle-skipping from one instrumental indigenous rocker or folk-singer to another.
"As amigas de Sex and the City estão entre as criaturas da ficção mais repulsivas que já conheci: fúteis, estúpidas, egoístas e entediantes. Além disso, isto não é um filme, é um catálogo."
"Frankly, you might have more fun watching a pigeon for 149 minutes."
"To these disappointed eyes, Little Children seems a frustrating mess."
It is so choked with its own solemnity that it barely musters the energy to tell a story.
Dramatically weak.
Quick take: Absurdly bad!
"The movie is about Bobby Darin, but we don't learn a thing about him other than he was arrogant. So, actually, the movie's about Kevin Spacey."
The result is rather lackluster.
"Gangster Squad is a generic name, which is fitting, because Gangster Squad is a generic movie."
Not even Mowg's soundtrack finds its own voice to differentiate itself from the original film. [Full review in Spanish]
"By the time the end credits rolled, its Riviera audience seemed just as glassy-eyed as the film's silver-screen ghouls."
"Even with Black's charisma, and a talented support cast, this is dull stuff."
"The ideas from the original text about death, consumerism, and the simplification of public information are undone by Baumbach's intent on connecting his story with, oh no, our well-known Covid pandemic. [Full review in Spanish]"
This flick screams cable TV...wait for it to hit there even if you are a big fan of any of the principals.
Martin and Levy mug for their close-ups and then retire to their trailers while the stunt doubles do the really hard work.
"I would have been happy to just sit back and watch a master filmmaker recreate these events -- maybe five years from now, or ten."
"It looks suspiciously like the producers didn't have the budget for crowd scenes, perhaps because they had spent so much on hairspray."
"Stone's re-re-re-treading of the same issues that have pre-occupied him since he was fighting in Vietnam - drugs, corruption, military, power - is tired."
"The 'spicy' numbers have no dazzle, the actors mug like contestants in a Maurice Chevalier impersonation contest, and the plot is a drily indigestible wad of show-must-go-on preciousness and socialist sentimentality."
"In short, there is nothing in this picture except a whopping shortcut towards the end -- and a few false parochialisms -- to keep it from banging the bell."
"An ordeal rather than a pleasure, a spectacle that cries out to be endured rather than enjoyed, ""Casanova,"" may be the perfect consummation of the distasteful conception Fellini had in mind."
"Not since Hee Haw has the South been so successfully slandered; Larry the Cable Guy's live action films are beyond abysmal, and his hayseed, grinning rube act is no less offensive or cynical when transposed into cartoon form."
"The entire undertaking is presented as if we're being taught a very complex lesson in enchantment and earthly conservation, and people who lean toward Japanimation will convince themselves they're watching something visionary. But it's just a cartoon."
"I laughed longer and louder than at any other movie this year; but before you try doing the same, be aware that you'll... face the wrath of people who are taking Black Swan seriously."
"GOTG Vol.2 is very good at two things: laughing at its own perceived comic brilliance, and slo-mo sequences of characters walking forth to Fleetwood Mac or Cheap Trick."
&quot;&#46;&#46;&#46;featuring none of the things that made the first one appealing&#44; this one is barely a spark&#44; much less a fire&#46;&quot;
A film that makes Rounders seem like a work of great seriousness and import.
Cheerful and very lazy... this is the kind of romantic comedy that never stretches either the audience or the actors.
"It's so overwritten it becomes an exercise in style rather than a story about its characters. On balance, I think it's an interesting miss."
"Fleder does Stallone no favours, directing Homefront strictly as a plodding and predictable thriller, the kind of generic project that usually stars a bunch of B-level actors."
An abject lesson in how to dehumanize a classic movie... Suspenseful horror and the subtle socio-political critique of feminism have been discarded in favor of slapstick comedy and haughty cleverness.
"So much promise, so little follow-through."
"The film has two very, very good ideas, but doesn't fit them together well; while its laughs are only sporadic, and the romantic subplot falls generally flat."
"It's so cool all the life has drained away, leaving nothing behind but a faint whiff of attitude."
Despite its goofiness and inflated sense of relevance&#44; &#8220;The First Purge&#8221; is serviceable throwaway entertainment&#46;&#46;&#46;&#46;But it&#8217;s still not a movie to recommend&#46; It&#8217;s more of the same in slightly &#40;and I do mean slightly&#41; different packaging&#46;
I've suffered this crap so you don't have to. My pleasure.
It all feels too simplistic.
There are moments of pure poetry in the movie but the production as a whole seems overlong and repetitive and takes a detour or two that distract from the aching beauty of the central story.
I find it difficult to find this slice of cheesy romance to be entirely inedible.
"Although it's wonderful to see Clint Eastwood, now 88, on screen, as the director, he fell short. Each character was acting in a different tone/genre and there was no unifying directorial vision. The script's thinly sketched characters didn't help."
"The whole experience flies by rather quickly and, in the end, leaves you with the feeling that it wasn't all that bad. Just don't try to make sense of it after the credits roll."
"Small Town Crime is so overly familiar, that I found myself forgetting it mere moments after exiting the auditorium."
It's an epic about a military officer who does not want to go to war. . .and is rightly branded a coward.
"Enough, already."
"More serious and morose than it needed to be I went to see a movie called The Wolverine, not a movie about weird, political in-fighting amongst a prominent Japanese family."
"Part two is every bit as thrilling as the first. It's gripping stuff. If you didn't know it was true, you wouldn't believe it."
Things just happen far too conveniently for a viewer not seduced by Marling to easily suspend disbelief.
"Sympathies sway back-and-forth between the wife and the husband, but never within the same episode, making Ozon just another god from the machine"
"Bill and Ted - Face The Music is corny and fun, but doesn't enhance this beloved franchise other than encouraging the world to be excellent. Sorry, I can't say the same for Keanu and Alex. Love them though."
"A succession of chases and fanciful combats, more akin to Dungeons & Dragons than to Carroll, leads to a peculiarly truncated climax. The 3-D effects are enjoyable, but the added depth can't make up for deficits in the concept or the plot."
"I understand the screenwriters' decision to pair Owens' story with the drama surrounding the U.S. decision whether to compete in the Olympics, but that timeline robs us of some of the drama of the protagonist's story."
"On a single, devotedly attentive viewing, I couldn't grok the logic of these headings beyond the lamely prosaic."
"Any hint of intelligent sarcasm or parody has vanished in favor of non sequiturs, references to the previous movie, and slapstick."
"You actually have to feel sorry for the actors, one of which is New Zealander Cliff Curtis, the only person I recognised."
"Unfortunately, it's conventionality, Hollywood-style, that does in the film."
"Paying lip service to sci-fi tropes, this hapless futuristic romp pilfers liberally without adding any depth."
"an occasionally pleasant misfire, a romantic comedy that, despite its bright premise and superlative cast, isn't as smart as it should be."
"The whole thing is monumentally gruesome and just as monumentally cynical, a riot of grisly clichés designed to titillate and amuse."
"Self-indulgent...undisciplined; a movie that celebrates movies, without being an essential one in its own right."
The modern-day royals have nothing on these guys when it comes to scandals. It's only in fairy tales that princesses that are married for political reason live happily ever after.
"""Sharp Stick"" is the charmless flip side of Sean Baker's ""Red Rocket."""
"Key components missing: a point, a sense of awe, serviceable acting, and fun."
"""They don't make 'em like this anymore"" will be used as both a compliment and an insult to this conservative corrective. Both interpretations apply."
"Without much to say, Songbird's existence feels rather repugnant."
I've never used drugs but I suppose the feeling is close to what I experienced watching Cats. [Full review in Spanish]
If I Stay is true to principle in one significant regard: It makes no concessions to anyone outside its teenage female cohort.
Sidney may profess her love for hip-hop - over and over again in voiceover - but the movie fails to make us feel that love.
"[I]t still feels like a made-for-television movie, a Friday night time passer whose characters, dialogue and plot all feel purely stock."
"The ""X-factor?"" These two don't have ""it."""
"A state-of-the-art multiplex three-ring circus whose special effects stagger the senses and play like a video game, whose human drama aims for the cosmic and lands waist-deep in the Big Silly."
"“Clerks” devotees may find something in it, all six or seven of them. But they probably don’t need to see it. They’re all in the movie."
...a sporadically effective Texas Chain Saw Massacre rip-off.
"This documentary about life in and around a vast scientific research centre in Antarctica. None of these meetings, however, is as interesting as the interspersed footage of the pole's natural wonders."
There are a few fun moments here but not enough to overcome the film's many flaws.
Too cinematic to be genuine
Wallow in Hollywood hipster self-absorption.
"If you stay home from only one movie this summer, make it 'Bad Boys II.'"
"Allowing the viewer to piece things together on their own is always welcome, but the film's desire to surprise and outwit makes it contrived."
Maybe... 'neo-grindhouse' has become a 'genre' because Tarantino's Midas touch turned grindhouse into ... art? Grindhouse sort of sounds like 'art house.' On the other hand-nah.
"Doesn't add much to the oft-told story of a boy and his dog, and it never establishes the rules of the dogs-in-space myth it creates, but it is perked up by the gentle intelligence of writer/director John Hoffman."
"The premise seems timely and provocative, but rarely does that translate to consistent suspense."
"It's not boring. But it doesn't shine, either."
A movie that will make you wish you were in detention.
Foester brings a different feel to the film than we have seen in its predecessors.
What's the lesson here? Should we all be talking to each other with two cans and a string?
Beautiful but boring.
"On a formal level, the only thing that really distinguishes Der Nachtmahr is the thermonuclear sound design, which blows up every time the characters enter an underground night club."
"It's just that - well, it's a bit thin."
"Utterly repugnant, child pornography masquerading as serious filmmaking."
"A dispiriting, unpleasurable work punctuated with flashes of vitalizing vulgarity."
"The problem is the story; it's a very thin tale, one that would have made a great short film. Alas the narrative is stretched to snapping point and the viewer ends up more than a little bored."
"This old school monster movie from producer Guillermo del Toro is well-shot and well-acted, but its creatures, like its title, are frightfully innocuous."
"Sandler strives for an awkward blend of sight gags, comic violence and smarmy sentiment that might even have sent Capra himself retching to the nearest lavatory."
"Never completely loses the viewer's interest, but the edgy, enigmatic would-be momentum goes slack in the second half as the slim plot extends to 97 minutes when 80 would have made for a tauter experience."
"Anderson... permeates this updating of the classic Dumas novel with an infectious sense of joy. Unfortunately, it's still dumber than a bag of hammers."
"For a debut feature, Linden makes strides in the right direction as a director, but as a screenwriter, the script lacks what it promises to deliver."
"Mukerji's performance, as previously mentioned, is at the mercy of her character - which alternates between being subject and subplot, according to the whims of a greedy two-pronged biopic."
The epitome of filmmaking by the manual.
"Self-defeatingly ""Tarantino-esque""."
To borrow from Colin Firth in Love actually: It is mainly scary how bad the writing is.
Monumentally awful
Colorful but dramatically unsatisfying.
It is foolishly unrealistic to expect Wenders to have made any kind of critical or challenging work. The issue is Wenders' inexplicable lack of interest in enriching or expanding the narrative we have come to learn of Pope Francis so far.
You sit there laughing at Culkin's best comedy ever. If only this movie wasn't supposed to be a horror picture.
Intellectual torture porn.
Knows how to make its familiar parts gleam when it wants to&#44; but that isn&apos;t often enough&#46; &#10;&#10;
Does romantic comedy have to come off as sugared stupidity? It does here.
Don't be afraid.
"Sequels usually are not as good as the original motion picture, but they're not usually as bad as Exorcist II: The Heretic, which is, in a word, atrocious."
"It's a handsomely designed film, tasteful, reserved, rather dull."
"It'll keep the kids content for a couple of hours, though it's likely to bore the grown-ups."
Anderson wants to turn his fox family into another version of the dysfunctional families that regularly pop up in his work. And this is where his adaptation really rubs against the grain of the original.
'Deadpan' doesn't begin to describe the tongue-in-cheek mix of gravity and cool detachment in which L'Iceberg's slapstick nonsense thrives.
"You can tell that there was a lot more thought put into this film than the likes of Serving Sara, but in the end that doesn't make it any more fun to watch."
"Adam Sandler plays a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon in Just Go With It, a fumbling comedy directed by Dennis Dugan that could have benefitted from surgical reconstruction. How about some liposuction to siphon off all those lame jokes?"
"Attempting to instill wit into a witless horror flick, Diablo Cody shows that her faux-hip dialogue does not a feature make."
"Given the excellence of 1950's Father of the Bride, the 1991 remake couldn't possibly have been more needless, though it at least gives Steve Martin a role which suits his wild and crazy talents."
"In the absence of anything resembling structure, character, point of view or sense of purpose, there is no place else for this empty project to go."
What put me off is the uneasy blend of the film's mean-spirited nature and the zany slapstick that accompanies it. There also seems to be a superficial lack of foundation for some of the things the characters do.
Unfortunately -- like its lead character -- the film doesn't do much more than drift from one scene to another.
"These guys are convincing enough when they're within their element, but woefully lack the acting chops when it comes to quieter, character-driven moments away from the action."
Jesse Eisenberg goes from the sublime to the ridiculous as he follows up 'The Social Network' with this dumb/dumber movie.
Dominion features some fun set pieces&#44; mostly charismatic actors&#44; and decent VFX work&#46; It also features a bloated mess of a screenplay and a lead performance that feels curiously inert&#46;
Quite simply the most middle of the road CG movie I think you'll ever see.
"George Lazenby is an interesting guy, but as a complete picture of his life, this movie is woefully inadequate."
"It lacks creative inspiration and reverts to the lighter-fare comic book films instead of embracing darker, more serious subject matter."
"Committed isn't [Heather] Graham's fault. If, for the first time on screen, she's charmless and annoying, it's better to pin the fault on director/writer Lisa Krueger, whose simplistic moralizing keeps Committed a dull, trying experience."
"if this is what Hollywood considers serious, important filmmaking, maybe the movie industry should stick to the low road. Directed with the in-your-face subtlety of a sitcom, the tone of the movie is weirdly miscalculated from the get-go."
Great concept but mediocre movie.
"There's laughter but it's empty, mean-spirited laughter. Bruno makes fun of people for no other reason than it can, not because it has something to say."
"DETECTIVE PIKACHU has some fun moments and good elements, but mostly it's a messy movie that is never really engaging or as fun as it should be."
Well-meaning western yarn starring Costner in the title role but it's too slow-moving and uneven to digest as anything riveting regarding the Wild West. Kasdan's Wyatt Earp definitely ends up shoots blanks
Baywatch had so much riding on it but it just couldn't live up to the original series.
Eduardo Verastegui sports the most distracting facial hair since that guy in Knocked Up who bet his roommates he wouldn't shave for a year.

There is a fundamental reason why 3-D technology doesn't work...
It's time for the Barden Bellas to either exit stage left or be dragged off by the hook.
Disappointing literary adaptation has some heavy themes.
Fletcher&apos;s labored&#44; downright desperate efforts at wringing laughs out of hopelessly stale material results in a series of entirely needless sequences&#46;&#46;&#46;
"Berk tries to capture the inanities of the Middle East: how both sides have to go through the motions of cat and mouse, constantly switching who's the feline and who's the rodent, but you can't care when the characters are this one-dimensional."
"The trailer gave away what this movie needed to give us lots of: surprises. Sweet, funny, amusing, but never gels."
". . .I still can't decide if the film is serious or not. If it is, this causes some major problems, since the morality it espouses is nuts."
A frustrating puzzle in which the pieces don't quite fit together
"The story tries audience patience with stilted dialogue, stock characters and plot elements that have seen more miles than the Millennium Falcon."
"For all the film's jauntiness (actually, because of it), it merely depresses."
"Australian television star Stapleton, despite his best efforts, never summons the intensity that Gerard Butler so effortlessly exuded in the previous film."
It's never a good sign when the real people behind a movie's story appear in the end credits and you're stumped as to who's who.
"Finally proves more exhausting than exhilarating as it lectures you about respecting Mother Nature one minute, knocks you over with a Gloria Gaynor cover the next, and squeezes in a lot of questionable comic relief in between."
"Once you take it to a certain point, it just goes flat, like sticking the big crescendo in between the first and second verses."
"I really did want to like this film, but I found it pedantic and dull. I actually dozed off in the middle, and I haven't done that since Elizabethtown."
The largely adorable cast is one of the only things about Solo that works particularly well.
"Its louder is better approach is just too much. The tantrums, the tears, the bloody tambourine the main character shakes at every given moment. It all culminates into a dizzying mesh of over the top sentiment."
"Apart from some fine slimy creeps in the Medusa episode, it's bland and toothy, with a narrative that gets bogged down in short-term action."
"Though it doesn't work as entertainment, this numbingly chipper rom-com (directed by Dermot Mulroney) might be of historical value someday as an A-to-Z guide to the genre's most overworked clichs."
a trifling&#44; inept fruitless attempt at a screwball comedy&#44; despite a sterling performance by Kaitlyn Dever&#44; marred by Julia Roberts&#44; whose phony Kamala Harris-cackling laugh is one of the more annoying things on celluloid&#46; We miss you&#44; Alan Dwan&#33;
Ford has come up with a nifty way of exploring the enduring allure and troubling underside of the superhero myth. It's just too bad his own all-too-human powers aren't quite up to the task.
"You never completely lose their feeling for the little guy, but by the end you feel a bit like Max's mom. Once you know he's safe, you're more than ready to drift into deep sleep."
"While back in 2009 the first 'Zombieland' felt fresh and fizzy, this attempted iteration comes across as a curiously flat recycling."
"An A-list soaper on moral pins and needles, the film is urbanely textured, full of Brit glibness and plush layering. Minghella makes broodingly adult coffee-table movies, and sometimes we wish he'd just serve up the coffee."
A heavy-handed re-imagining.
A lot of this is amusing and somehow telling. But what does it all add up to?
Another fogettable film from an actor that once promised to be the best of his generation. [Full review in Spanish]
This film's biggest problem is that it's just plain boring.
"A brutal and admirably grueling serial-killer thriller, this Australian import is also repetitive and ultimately a little dull."
"The plot's not as confusing as it sounds, but the film's frenetic pace, kooky visual effects, choppy tone and overblown acting make it all a bit more disorienting than necessary."
"If this movie is any indication, this franchise needs a great deal of work to improve and salvage a series that the studio should have terminated after ""Judgment Day."
An arduous cheerleader comedy geared toward those too green to know that cheerleader comedies went out long before the last pompom shake of Bring It On.
"It is no longer enough for one superhero to fight a single villain while dealing with his own personal problems, apocalypse must now enter into it."
"Jack the Giant Slayer isn't close to being among the elite films in theaters now, but if your significant other or your friends narrow down the viewing options to this or Oz the Great and Powerful, best to gently push them in this direction."
"This is one of those movies where at the end of the year you'll say, 'Underclassman, what was that about? I don't even remember it.'"
"Titanic is a good, often stunning movie caught in a three-and-a-half hour drift."
"If it were any more obtuse, The New World would be a flipbook where the moving picture was obscured by a thumb drawn over the stick figures."
The new Hellboy lands with a thud that's loud and dark - but almost instantly forgettable.
After the Sunset tries to be two different films.
It's all a little staid. Kids these days may demand a little more edge.
"I appreciate the attempt to try to make this world -- an obliterated, totalitarian Chicago -- as watchable as possible. But there's too much to keep straight."
"... the film was a sensation, becoming a big hit and spawning a whole industry of southern-fried vigilante lawman action pictures."
you know something's gone horribly awry when The Kitchen's most interesting moments in retrospect are the pre-film production logos
"Isn't awful enough to be truly memorable but it certainly doesn't offer anything new, trudging through most of the same plot details that Sam Raimi covered with personality and style in his trilogy."
On TV&#44; Bob&#8217;s Burgers is exquisite comfort food&#46; In movie form&#44; it&#8217;s more like a heaping helping of leftovers&#44; bigger in portion than flavor&#46;
"MacFarland just can't go toe-to-toe with the likes of Liam Neeson or Charlize Theron. Parts of ""West"" look like those old Oscar intros where Billy Crystal would be spliced into actual movies."
You'll be doing yourself a huge favor if you go into this movie with lowered expectations.
Village idiot.
"Except for a handful of misplaced laughs, ""Revolutionary Road"" is nothing but loud arguments, awkward silences and other bits of unpleasantness."
"Pillow Book may be a dull, heartless, cruel film, but for what it's worth, it looks marvelous."
"Alan Bennett’s play Allelujah!, set in a geriatric ward, isn’t one of his better works, and Richard Eyre’s film adaptation does it no favours by presenting it in a stripped-down form. "
Ridley Scott is the weak link; he's never made a film this for-hire. Even Scott's signature misted atmosphere is absent.
"It's a bad film, and I mean bad."
The 5th Wave represents a trend of movies that care more about their follow-ups than their individual selves.
"You know how it ends, but you cannot fathom how many pratfalls it takes to get there."
A film that contributes little or nothing to what is already known. [Full review in Spanish]
A modestly inventive but curiously bloodless version of the Bard's timeless tragedy.
Represents everything that's stale about movie-making -- and especially movie awards -- today.
Unfriended just about evolves beyond its gimmick but it's still nothing more than a run-of-the-mill horror flick.
"A camp classic, funny for all the wrong reasons."
"Given the caliber of the cast, Poms can't help but generate a laugh or two, but one can't help but feel the particular demographic the film is obviously aimed at deserve better than this at times sluggish and predictable outing."
Not funny. Not interesting.
"Now you see it, now you don't."
"Like its sets of the Alamo...the movie attempts to do more than is necessary, bogging down in minutiae where traditional facades would have done just as well."
"An exhaustingly long, overstuffed movie that probably would’ve worked better as a TV series."
"Andrew Lloyd Webber's kitschy theatrical spectacle is now a kitschy theatrical movie, a mix of melodrama, horror, romance, mystery and melody heaped together into a cinematic smorgasbord, one heavy in starch."
"""Geostorm"" has a more clever premise than it needs to get to its ultimate goal of trashing some of our planet's nicest places. But the results are still mostly dull-witted."
"Whatever brownie points Tillman scored with ""Notorious"", ""Faster"" is that wake-up call that he's no John Woo."
"The doubled-length simply means more opportunities for Snyder's trademark slo-mos, characters to get slammed into walls and rocks and for Junkie XL's bombastic score to drive you nuts."
The top-notch female cast isn't provided a decent blueprint to develop out of the provided stereotypes. The James Bond-Mission: Impossible spin that the actors try to emulate never takes full flight.
"In the real world, this would be called... passive-aggressive... but in the world of adolescent romantic comedies, this is deemed a charming and daring act by a 'nice guy'..."
"A slow-motion zeppelin crash that starts as a dull-edged fable, and then spirals further and further out of control without ever growing more exciting or interesting."
A misfire.
"It's OK for a movie to leave an audience asking questions. In fact, it can be a sign that a movie has a lot to say. Except, that is, when the question is this one: ""So what?"""
"Many kids will enjoy this traditionally animated story, but parents may find it overlong even at a running time of less than 90 minutes."
"Undermined by its form: strange as it ought to be, the mockumentary conventions of the movie make everything strangely familiar."
"Imbuing this with credibility is not quite within the long reach of whispering Michael Fassbender, energetically though he tries and urgently though he whispers."
"No matter how much you want to like the film, something is missing: a spark, a shimmer, a thrust of discovery."
"Devolves...from bland diversion into some truly unsettling sexual politics, and tumbles from that already low plateau into an ersatz In the Bedroom."
"The premise might sound interesting, but the plotting is so utterly predictable that The Color of Money turns into a pool-room variation of The Karate Kid."
"Despite an appealing cast, though, neither comedy nor suspense really takes flight until very near the end, largely due to a script that isn't equal to the filmmakers' enthusiasm."
"The big problem with Hitchhiker, and it is a crucial one, is that the middle section of the film really isn't that interesting."
"Disney has an unlimited supply of backlog intellectual properties they can recycle/reimagine/reconfigure forever. These titles make money and win-over unknowing new audiences, but in the end, it's filmmaking at its most safe, lazy, and unimaginative."
"The plot, told almost in real time, is full of unbelievable situations. We see characters run, get upset, and be chased, however, the dramatic tension is almost non existent. [Full review in Spanish]"
"""Loopers"" will appeal to those who love chasing that dimpled little ball around, but may leave the rest of us in the rough."
"For all his fidelity to the Wertmller screenplay, Ritchie has made a movie that is neither as attractive nor as repulsive, and certainly not as funny, as the original."
It's not so much a movie as it is another step in an ongoing marketing campaign.
"There is something ridiculous, not when it begins, but as it nears its end, which makes one want to quickly forget The Pale Blue Eye... [Full review in Spanish]"
"The actors, especially Winger, keep The Lovers watchable, but ultimately can't give it memorable life."
A dull exercise in deconstructing Jane Austen's life to provide a life experience basis for her novels.
"All those years in the oven, and ""The Comedian"" still comes out half-baked."
"This is one of those ""gotcha!"" movies where nothing you see can be believed."
"The African American fliers' great achievement merits a great movie. ""Red Tails"" isn't it."
A movie about a great set of abs falling in lust with a great pair of ... legs. No romance. No magic. No heart. No soul.
"Captain Fantastic ties its many loose ends into charming little bows, pats itself on the back for its own ingenuity, and skips along on its merry way."
"The most unintentionally hilarious movie to come along since ""Burlesque"" and at least in the case of that film, the wolves on display were far more convincing."
"Depending wholly upon the blinkered empathy of daydreamy teen viewers, a typical FPJ movie skims over character, plot, and dialogue."
"It is not about the today's truly wealthy, which is a missed opportunity."
"It succeeds in bringing O'Barr's comic-book vision to life, but there's little else going on behind the graphic razzle-dazzle and the moody, ominous soundtrack."
State-of-the-art special effects and revolutionary underwater cameras can&#8217;t hide the fact that Avatar&#58; The Way of Water is basically the same movie as the original with more blue people &#40;some are slightly green now&#33;&#41; that get on your last nerve&#46;
The authorial voice in Damsels in Distress lacks definition.
Phantom mail ... a postal carrier's worst nightmare ...
"You have to give Baron Cohen's publicists five stars, though the film itself falls short of that."
"As in too many of his recent films, he comes off as a pampered superstar going through the paces of an unending ego trip."
Nothing in this film sets your nerves a-tingling.
The Doorman desperately wants to recapture the spirit of Die Hard but demonstrates a complete lack of understanding in what made that film ... work.
"Lacks the heart and soul, and especially the visual ingenuity the Wachowskis usually bring to their work."
"The clumsy and ineffectual story doesn't do anything but stand in place, whirring."
The film is weirdly disjointed and uncertain as to tone.
Don't get me wrong: There are a lot of laughs in The Boss. The problem is that the space in between them is stagnant and shapeless.
"Chastain... gives such a compelling and deeply human performance, so effortlessly charismatic, that you wish she had been the center of a completely different movie."
It's all rather implausible and hugely melodramatic as it milks ham-fisted histrionics from high soap opera. A pitiable excuse for a movie.
"Given the opportunity to say something, anything insightful about mass surveillance, Oliver Stone just hammers the point that ""protest is patriotic,"" over and over again."
"...if you like the man and his music, then I've got a concert documentary for you."
"The film, whatever its intentions, winds up just being deeply depressing and, at nearly 2 1/2 hours, it's a very long slog indeed to the finish."
"As purported, if Jet Li's final Chinese martial arts movie is indeed Jet Li's Fearless, the talented fist-and-foot pounder would have made more impact if he had ended things sooner."
An incredibly pretentious film in search of a point.
Everything collapses under its own weight.
"All the movie's elements, with the exception of the irritatingly hyperactive editing during the musical numbers, are top-notch. So why isn't ""Nine"" more satisfying in the end?"
How do you know when a film doesn't deliver in a particular genre? The audience starts to laugh at scenes that are supposed to be genuinely terrifying.
The Twin is basically Midsommar meets The Boy&#44; and yet not as fun as that mash-up might imply&#46;
"It’s not quite the toxic disaster it’s being treated as but 65 is nowhere near the giddy lark it should have been, crash-landing somewhere in the middle instead."
"A historical superproduction in which style, aside from committee-made, widescreen tedium, is spectacularly absent."
Even the usually reliable end credits blooper reel couldn't bring me any comedy solace.
"[E]ven when it's not telegraphing its secrets, it kinda is, anyway, in its helplessness to hide that it's cheating..."
"Jody Hill claims he was inspired by Scorsese's Taxi Driver (you can add King of Comedy) but his comedy tries too hard to be edgy, dark, change the defintion of the genre."
What started out as a crackling yarn starts to become a numbing exercise in narrative excess.
What movie would Jesus see this holiday season? God help us if it's The Chronicles of Narnia ... I'm surprised Mel Gibson wasn't hired to guest-direct the crucifixion scene.
"As much as the original ""Hangover"" was fresh and funny, ""The Hangover Part II"" is just stale and painful."
"It has a problem that's familiar to competently made, sporadically involving crime procedurals: It's just good enough to inspire wishes that it were better."
"While Super Troopers is above Academy standards, its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling."
"Billy Boyd's distinctly un-Pippin turn as a psycho drug dealer aside, there's little of interest in this misjudged, miswritten mess."
"A big, dumb mountain of fluff that boggles the mind with its sheer volume and range of foolishness."
"Evolve[s] from a silly, ineptly made teen thriller into a crushingly heavy-handed cautionary tale about the morality of online voyeurism."
"Reitman mistakes glibly cornering all sides of the argument for complexity, on top of which some unfortunate writing and directing decisions make it seem like Hart was more of a victim."
"...after a while, the whole thing just becomes tiresome."
"Less cohesive and less funny than its predecessor, completely lacking the creative spark that made Cairo, Nest of Spies such a riotous joy."
Not enough Loki. Too many tacky 3D effects. And then there's the hard fact that everything old isn't necessarily new again just because the bottom line wishes it so.
It's one of those movies whose sole conviction is that no gag is so tired or gross or easily grasped the first time that it cannot be run into the ground.
"Thankfully for Chicagoans this film doesn't star Brett Favre because of his numerical jersey affiliation, but with a story this weak, that stretch wouldn't be too far."
Typical Stone bloating applied to a mystfyingly legendary band.
Tries to jerk tears but instead elicits giggles.
"Characters are more than a bullet point of traits, which Mile 22 time-after-time tries to subterfuge."
"This is your standard genre fare: Smart-ass player gets schooled, finds love, and is redeemed in time for the final big game."
"The Amazing Spider-Man attempts to straddle - it's too similar to Raimi's world, but simultaneously too different, and all it ends up being is a whole bunch of neither."
"Uneventful and dull to look at, the film adapts a short story by E.L. Doctorow that probably should have stayed on the page."
...another example of a writer engaging in fictional wish fulfillment.
To call Wrong Turn tedious and uninspired is to be kind.
Essentially&#44; Biker Boyz is a soap opera wrapped up in the trashy-but-flashy packaging of The Fast and the Furious&#46;
"If you have not figured out the identity of Luden by the finale, it will only be because you do not care."
"Josh Hartnett is good and I love Shannyn Sossamon I think she could become a big star, but this comedy is so wrong on so many levels."
Made-for-TV mixes G- and R-rated stories
There were no real stakes. I just felt like the script was really weak. There wasn't a lot going on and there wasn't a lot of character development.
"The writing here is rarely funny, and often trite and predictable."
"The writing team of ""National Lampoon's Van Wilder"" crafted it as a satire about conflicting levels of sexual experience among teens, but fail to connect the significance of erotic pleasure to the emotional demands of budding adults."
"It's a superficial ripoff of a worn out genre, built entirely around a laughable performance."
Does not belong at a theater near you.
"""Live By Night"" is missing bite. And without teeth, all the picture can do is slosh around without focus earning the unfortunate distinction of a directorial career worst for Affleck."
"It's more enamored with creating a specific look and feel than being cohesive, and as a result it becomes irreparably lost."
"Settlers is so bare in world-building details that its characters float untethered, and a major mid-film reveal seems like a narrative shortcut."
"There is something badly wrong with the film's premise, which contradicts Milne's lessons that Tigger can't climb trees ... and that, crucially, Tigger can't be unbounced."
"Good grief, Kong again?"
"After a shaky start, Wilson and Hudson manage to inject some charm into the proceedings, but ""Alex & Emma"" is a very slight affair"
"The demon's favourite trick is to inhabit someone's face, stretching it into a Joker smirk before saying in a distorted voice, ""Truth or Dare!"" That trick happens about 20 times in the movie and it never fails to not shock."
"As a notch in Vin Diesel's action film belt, it serves its purpose. But come Halloween, I doubt anyone is even going to remember this film existed."
"After seeing what Boorman hath wrought, it becomes pathetically apparent that he was trying to wing it with an obscure conception."
"Ghost Town isn't terrible; if it were on TV, I'd watch it. But it's a couple of steps away from being good, and many more steps away from being as good as the movies and plays it swipes from."
"While it's not awful and has a smattering of decent, if scattered moments, this is a fairly bland sports drama offering. (Complete Parental Content Review also available)"
"""Eternals"" istoo much of a not good enough thing."
"'7 Days in Entebbe' should keep you on the edge of your seats. Instead, it makes you sit back and doze off."
"The Heart of Me, inspired by Rosamund Lehmann's anguished classic The Echoing Grove, is a costume drama that wants to be more than the sum of its wardrobe."
"Standard-issue liberal guilt and hand-wringingly uninteresting dilemmas are the order of the day, with no real surprises or challenges."
"What begins promisingly enough ends up a gratuitously violent, underwritten, depressing scrap heap of a movie that aims for two audiences and misses both."
"This is not a relationship drama so much as a piece of agitprop, a rage-fueled polemic against a government that did nothing in the way of ensuring its citizens' safety."
"I think that, even as a child, I would have wanted a clearer plot line, some moments of suspense woven into the hectic action, and a greater variety of pace."
"Despite the empathy that actors have for their characters, the hyper ironic and self-aware stylisation gives Lanthimos a smug authoritative 'smartness' over everything depicted on-screen."
&#46;&#46;&#46;a hopelessly generic and pervasively tedious drama that contains few&#44; if any&#44; elements designed to capture and sustain the viewer&#8217;s interest&#46;&#46;&#46;
"Drive, and many of Refn's other films, were thrillingly kinetic; here, by gluing his actors to their spots, he gives us beautiful images but nothing to watch. About halfway through, there is a brief foot chase. At least it moves."
"There's too much unnecessary filler, and as a result, the romance worth exploring suffers for it."
There's an edgy but rewarding chemistry between Bullock and McCarthy that makes me wish they were attached to a less foul-tasting premise.
"Given the high quality of horror films of late, this one doesn't stand out, except for a twist ending that needed to be better explained."
"In yet another blander-than-bland remake of a classic film, flash-over-substance specialist Tony Scott takes Joseph Sargent's taut, 1974 action-thriller and processes it through the multiplex mulching machine."
You know you're in whole mess of trouble when the villains turn out to be more interesting than the hero.
"Beatty's long layoff has Rules Don't Apply landing with a thud like Hughes' famed ""Spruce Goose""."

None but the mad will want to see Rush Hour 3.
...[a] generic and syrupy teen comedy...isn't necessarily what a girl needs-a derivative and excessively perky preteen portrait of a curvy belly-buttoned babe-in-the-woods
A case of ambition exceeding actual accomplishment-Cheadle tries for a high note in 'Miles Ahead' that he never manages to reach.
...it doesn't have the cleverness to match its charisma.
"Fairly putrid in both conception and execution. Still, you can't stop looking at it."
"The movie's landscape is a disappointingly barren digital domain, the same gray cliffs, deserts and seas familiar from 300 and so many game-worlds."
A sometimes winning but fatally underwritten workplace comedy.
Takes the oldest romantic comedy notion that there is -- opposites attract -- and does absolutely nothing new or even clever with it.
"Slapstick humor, a rehashed plot and generic voice casting."
"In the end, The Soloist can take a bow for its effort but shouldn't be expecting any encores."

There's not a spark of sense here.
"While it neither succeeds nor satisfies as drama, it's a great calling card for the actors involved, principally Joseph Gordon-Levitt."
"A belabored trifle that's occasionally amusing but often just bewildering, beginning with the movie's intentionally outlandish setup."
"A muddled, over-ambitious mess."
"A good writer starts with characters and plot and allows the themes to come naturally from the story. Sean Ellis' script for Cashback is all theme, and it's not that interesting a one to begin with."
"...being point blank for Brolin delivering the horrendous dialogue coaxed me to exclaim aloud - ""this guy is dumb as a post."""
An over-arching smugness blights this comic investigation into true love.
Witless&#44; clunky and tedious with too much tonal whiplash and not nearly enough laughs to turn it into a campy cult classic&#46;
No wonder the Martians never came. There's no intelligent life here.
"Gwyneth Paltrow and Aaron Eckhart lead the cast, but their performances as modern characters rank second to Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle."
Le Carr's cynicism is undermined with an extra-time cheat that strips the film of any pungency.
"In trying to merge the disaster and romance genres, the film simply doesn't know which it wants to be most of the time, and ends up doing neither well."
Baywatch might earn its r-rating but doesn't do anything fun with it aside from the same boring crude jokes.
The degree to which this fast-food movie and its predecessors are completely forgettable is counteracted by Anderson&#8217;s usual clip-show recaps at the beginning of each new sequel&#46;
"Intelligently written, sumptuously produced, and dramatically inert."
The documentary is just more of what we've come to expect from director Richard Linklater's expanded fanverse.
"The loose, rambling conversations that substitute for action might be more interesting if any of the characters were capable of real introspection."
This skin-deep MTV Films production is more about promoting soundtrack sales than social causes.
"Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates is a brisk and frantic comedy that tries hard to be hilarious. It fails despite a talented cast and a workable premise, falling victim to a kind of desperate crassness."
Naim has created a low-key mood piece that should have been more cutting.
"Ultimately, fans of the franchise won't be disappointed while the rest of us will be quietly hoping that Homeland Security step in a finish the job."
"Makes some good decisions in style and execution, but its disconcerting tonal shifts make it tedious. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Slicker than the original, it is also less satisfying, erratic in pace and tone."
"If Disney started up a documentary division the they would probably have a similar tone to the hackneyed, tired, saccharin approach that Marsh has taken to tell what is actually a profoundly disturbing story."
Inane chatter dominates Peckinpah-style action.

What should be a story of courage and humanity lacks one essential element: gravity.
"Shockingly unilluminating, even dull."
"Even if you're willing to forgive the film's tendency to retread well-known paths, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children falls apart in its final act."
There's a slowness to the pacing and the jokes that fail to fit the screwball nature of the couple's chaotic circumstances.
"A necessary story, a missed opportunity. [Full review in Spanish] "
This indie exercise is so stultifying you might want to check your own pulse.
"James Wan's Saw starts off incomprehensibly, turns nasty in a hurry, and ultimately induces numb exhaustion."
The 355 is not only wasting the time of it's all-star cast but halfway through we realize it's wasting our time as well.
"... A cold, soulless film that watches a family fall apart without caring much about it. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Having made the splendidly entertaining Cinema Paradiso in 1988, Giuseppe Tornatore now exhibits his versatility with A Pure Formality, which is not entertaining at all."
"... feels like two films crammed together, with the result more effective in its first half as a portrait of a fractured family navigating difficult circumstances."

It works well with Florence Pugh as our protagonist but it&#8217;s a bit too long and it thinks it&#8217;s smarter than it is&#8230;it might be better on cable&#46;
"Don't be duped by the steamy-sounding premise, for this dud manages to turn the prospect of swinging into a dull and decidedly antiseptic affair."
"Watching it is like spending time with a know-it-all teenager; the kid isn't neccessarily wrong, but he's definitely irritating."
"This adaptation of Donna Tarrt's novel has an interesting -- if not always plausible -- story, but there must have been a more efficient way to tell it. Large stretches, especially the coming-of-age Nevada chapters, are leaden longueurs."
"The best advice is just to watch 'Planes, Trains & Automobiles' again and keep this stink-bomb off your itinerary."
"Somewhere during the transition to a live-action movie, screenwriters Jackie and Jeff Filgo have turned Greg from endearingly weedy into annoyingly insufferable."
"A movie that is frenzied but unexciting, packed with action but lacking in distinctive moments..the camera is perpetually half a beat behind whatever it is you want to see."
Would someone please write a movie good enough for Timothy Olyphant? A Perfect Getaway sure isn't it.
"Like the most blithering chick flicks, Finding Bliss obnoxiously and misleadingly wants to have its cake and get eaten too."
"It doesn't live up to the first one... but if you're going to watch one of the sequels, this one would be it."
Why does Hollywood always feel the need to pander to kids by throwing in annoying comic characters and out of place humor in a story that doesn't need it?
This mashup of a teenage assassin lark and high school misfit comedy misses the chance to add a supercool heroine to pop culture.
Any hope of meaningful reflection or insight is doused by a steady drip of often redundant and banal observations.
Never veers from The Hollywood Guide To Mid-Budget Family Fare.
It would be easy to laugh off if it wasn't so clearly a comment on historical reality.
"Mangold's camera has zero energy, making this probably the oldest-looking movie by a young director out of Hollywood this year."
You'd think someone would have figured out by now that putting a big TV star in a lame movie doesn't make the movie any better.
"Shopping, sex, and stereotypes merge in trite sequel."
This rather silly follow-up to Cat People isn't so much unwatchable as it is merely unnecessary.
I find myself both enjoying the unapologetic bloodfest of Haute Tension and extending certain digits at it for trying to be overly clever.

It is appallingly funny in a way that few parodies ever manage. But it is undeniably exciting.
"For some reason, even though the asteroid is ""as big as Texas"", they only need to drill 800 feet to get to the very center."
"Clocking in at more than 200 minutes, the film plods along a muck of bad dialogue, contrived tension, finicky logic, and a sense that no one had the energy to create a solid pace in the first place."
It's ultimately a film dealing in hackneyed horror tropes and employing a highly slippery and questionable toxic masculinity thesis.
"Hammer might be back, but the studio sure isn't hammering out anything that's remotely horrifying."
Dismally lazy nonsense whose only redeeming element is that its credits roll a good 10 minutes before the conclusion of its stated runtime&#46;
"Lacks anything vaguely resembling a plot, while failing to deliver suspense or thrills."
"There's a sunset, but no one rides into it."
"...a film with meager production values about an odd woman and what she did to inspire the British tabloids...not for everybody, but for some it might have a morbid fascination."
What the hell has happened to Dolly Parton? Her face and body has been so distorted by plastic surgery that it becomes a distraction.
"By the end of its serpentine even-a-sports-flick-can-house-a-con plot, you may be too busy rolling your eyes to buy into the rabid-fan axiom that even minor Mamet is a treat."
"Yet, for all the laughs something is off."
It has a convoluted and silly plot and wastes several of the greatest actors working today. (Splice Today)
"The story here is sincere but simplified, in a way that dances perilously close to the kind of conservative, historical revisionism that works to whitewash Britain’s own racist past."
"There is no justifiable reason for such a lengthy running time, especially given that the original got in, did what it had to do and got out in about an hour and a half."
...an aggressively manipulative piece of work that's been shamelessly designed to shock and provoke the viewer.
"It starts loud and just pounds along, and rather than the pulse-pounding adrenaline rush intended, a stultifying action fatigue quickly sets in."
"Duke shows great promise as a writer and potential as a director, but serious problems as a one-man shop."
"Featuring both a solid cast and a likeable lead performance from Meg Foster, the overly simplistic narrative concretizes into rigid formula by the third act."
JTHJ struggles hard to find its own two feet to stand on.
"Throws jokes at the audience like alms for the poor; unfortunately, they're all pennies."
...perhaps the worst example of what is known as a 'jukebox musical.'
"The best that can be said about this movie, which is quite bad, is that it's not a complete surprise."
There really isn't anything that could've saved The 27 Club from being an utter stinker when the basic fundamentals of its premise and screenplay were so poorly constructed to begin with.
"For a film that should have been smart and fun, Frost/Nixon turns out to be a stodgy romance to the concept of ""heroic"" modern journalism."
"As coming of age stories go, Wah-Wah does little to distinguish itself."
Quite simply&#58; this is something you could read about in a few paragraphs&#44; and the film fails to present any type of dilemma during its passionless narrative&#46;
Due Date is not so much a road movie as a cultural car-crash.
Nair navigates narrative waters littered by a shipwreck's worth of detritus; too many characters bob and sink.
"Instead of being a companion to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo And Juliet (1996) , this can be filed under wasted opportunities."
Clever spice-related allegories don't make this messy rom-com any less insipid and even wacky. A cute them song also is not enough to save it from it's own strange script.
A murky mess that grows more hopelessly convoluted with each passing minute.
"An unimaginative, protracted gore-fest that swipes from David Fincher's Seven like a cinematic pickpocket but only comes up with lint."
A screwball spoof that's salvaged only by the sarcastic sincerity of Kate McKinnon skewering MI6's icy chief (Gillian Anderson).
"In special effects, Lucas has moved a galaxy beyond. In energy, not yet."
"Beyond its fantasy elements, Sfar's film doesn't color outside the lines as much as he might like us to think."
"The last segment is the best, so much so that one wishes Nava had left out the first two parts and concentrated on fleshing out the third section."
"There's always too much going on, which is easily forgivable for a while. But as the minutes mount, the flaws are only accentuated."
"It's a disgusting, repellent, sadomasochistic extension of the kind of slapstick that made 'The 3 Stooges' so popular and filled with gross, gruesome pranks that men seem to find hilarious."
The mixing of vague historical anecdote and pure Hollywood fantasy don't quite mix.
"There's no center to the film, no focal point to the story, no main character."
"It's a movie where a viewer would be hard-pressed to point out anything that really works; it's too gooey to bite as satire, and too much of a cartoon to be a sincere cri de coeur for the Second City's metastasized gang culture."
"The only reason to watch this movie is to laugh at Statham's hilarious attempt at a Southern accent, and even that isn't that funny after a while."
Its rebel yell takes a back seat to the inevitabilities of the squeaky plot.
"The fanboys are bound to enjoy it, though, with its action, action, action, bits of gruesomeness and sometime bawdy humor."
Things get more than a bit hammy&#46; All of which undermines the thrills and chills and replaces it with rote genre material that quickly wears out its welcome and will likely make you wish you hadn&apos;t RSVPed&#46;
It's dead in the water before the climax.
Relativno pristojan akcijski triler koji ipak daje dobre razloge Hollywoodu da vi%u0161e ne skrnavi filmske i televizijske klasike
"No, sadly, is a no-no from Chile's Pablo Larraín."
"Angelina Jolie's romance/comedy/drama isn't terribly romantic, comedic or dramatic."
"One can only wonder if cinematic animation might find a new path, one far removed from the sadly lucrative video-game market."
A reasonably good take on a great classic.
"Unfunny and relies too heavily on lame gross out gags and vulgar dialogue. Big gimmick is seeing the original cast all back together, but the last time we checked, no one was signing petitions to get them all in the same room."
"True Story is never flat-out boring. The situation's inherent fascination exudes a certain power. But when the most involving scene is a made-up encounter between Jones (hugely under-used) and Franco, well, you know something's off."
"Watching Chris Pratt fight to save the future has a certain appeal, but in the here and now, he can't even save the movie."
Horrible Bosses 2 falls firmly into the latter camp; unable to capture the humor of its predecessor.
Too methodically-paced with little payoff The Phenom is like a flamed out prospect that can't make use of its potential.
Kissing a Fool. They got that right.
"Idle Hands is all thumbs. Ten of 'em, black and blue and bloodied, all pointed down in deference of the Siskel and Ebert rating system. Yuck."
"It's big, cartoonish and empty, with an interesting premise that is underdeveloped and overproduced."
"Poltergeist isn't one of those remakes that pisses on the corpse of the original, but it doesn't do much with the framework either."
"While the script and direction definitely drag El Cantante down, the portrait of Puchi in this film -- true or false -- places the final perfectly groomed and polished nails in the movie's creative coffin."
"The movie opens with a goofy sequence mimicking the TV show, so you know immediately that this will be as lightweight and undemanding a Hollywood fable as My Week With Marilyn."
"All [director] Alexander proves in Punisher: War Movie is that a martial-arts-trained woman can make a film just as stupid, coarse and numbing as any muscle man."
"Similar to the upcoming third reboot of the Spiderman franchise, this Fantastic Four reboot feels unnecessary. The story has not changed, nor has the dynamic of the group."
"Since the filmmakers had no access to the private self as expressed in Plath's body of work, Sylvia is limited to her public life, which was her death. The result feels like art imitating life, once removed."
"In Marlo, Diablo Cody has created her most complicated character to date. Would that her writing displayed similar richness and empathy in painting the film's supporting characters."
This movie has taken a firebrand book and turned it into a whingeing piece of defeatism.
... it's not very good -- long (2hr.32min.) and mostly inert.
[The] film can never quite find the balance between fairy tale and Joan of Arc-style fable and gets bogged down in questing when it should be delivering magic and adventure.
"A film with all of the ideas of an exciting midnight movie, made with all the passion of a man who'd rather be delivering a seminar about his new filmmaking software instead."
"If there's one good thing that can come from the wreckage of this movie, it's for Chopra's career in Hollywood films to take off."
Its deliberate lack of originality is demoralizing.
"The movie is so predictable, it's not surprising that the script is credited to first-timers Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, and the direction to John Stockwell, a former acting peer to Tom Cruise."
"Might have worked a little better on stage, and with a few different actors."
How do movies like this get financed?
"Michael Madsen? Michelle Rodriguez? 'I'll take ""Actors Who Should Never Appear in Period Pieces"" for $500, Alex.'"
"As for the songs, they're guaranteed to keep your shoes glued to the floor"
"The Bag Man is as silly as its title, which both a joy and a shame."
"Doesn't work as either something fresh, a modern womanifesto or laugh-filled effort."
Would certainly make for an entertaining example of cult filmmaking if only there had been some form of emotional investment in any of the character's and their actions.
"Aside from its throwback grindhouse visual aesthetic, the film provides only hit-or-miss laughs and thrills, relying on stock characters and gratuitous gore rather than refreshing the formula."
"It all ends exactly the way you knew it would, although not as soon as you'd like."
"In the end -- the beginning and the middle, too -- the spirit of Christmas With the Kranks rings as false as the bell of a shopping-mall Santa."
"Although the idea of a female adventurer (essentially a counterpart to Indiana Jones) sounds exploitable, the execution of her feats are incredibly pitiful."
"When a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer, better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film, that's a bad sign. A very bad sign."
The filmmakers aim their cynicism more at us than at any government or drug company.
The documentary stumbles where it could have soared.
"Callas may be forever, but Franco Zeffirelli's fictionalized tribute is not."
"A moderately enjoyable romantic comedy that does its job as a date movie, but is so innocuous, instantly forgettable and free of the Farrelly brothers' trademark visual humor that it's sure to disappoint the directors' die-hard following."
"In some ways, ""Christopher Robin"" might be better suited for a night out for Mom and Dad rather than a Saturday afternoon with the whole family, but it's doubtful that's what Disney is hoping for."
"The Predator guts and slashes its way to gory sci-fi mediocrity, but is further failed by abysmal pacing that loses characters, subplots and interest along the way."
"The movie makes a lot more sense if you've read the book and already know how the puzzle pieces fit. They do a commendable job capturing the essence of the book, but lose some of the magic."
Incredibly simple and vastly unoriginal.
A semi-creative biography about someone I couldn't give two sh*ts about. Grows tiresome well before the punishing third act.
It's impossible to get excited about such cardboard roles from writers Jose Rivera and Tim Sullivan. These two need to write to Juliet ASAP to rediscover their love for writing %u2014 if they ever had it.
The thing is an unadulterated mess. The moments of entertainment that you get...get drowned in all the other detritus that Bay brings to the table.
Its fourth-wall-breaking wags a finger at the perceived facile nature of celebrity-driven mass culture even as it ultimately condescends to audiences.
"It will make a nice weekend watch for a lot of people, I think. But it also feels uncomfortably algorithmic, an exercise that shows that if you don't start with much of a foundation, there's only so much fancy dress you can drape all over it."
"The Bride might be inspired by Mary Shelley, but its nature seems to draw from Robert Louis Stevenson. Aping the latter's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, this feels like two separate movies battling for the upper hand, with the end result basically being a tie."
"Begins in a state of near-total incoherence and somehow meanders further from there, plunging into almost experimental territory with its choppily edited mess of ridiculous dialogue and hyper-dense plotting."
"Despite a strong, authentic depiction of Indigenous culture, High Ground leaves us longing for a more nuanced thriller."
"has a meandering quality, where each individual section is intriguing, but they are difficult to add up to a meaningful whole"
"If, quite understandably, you enjoy seeing Russell Crowe being manly and bashing baddies, you won't be disappointed, especially if you're not too old. But really..."
The issue isn't the film's slow pace; it's its duration and lazy screenwriting that use violence and sex like a slap to the back of the head.
"If the writers intended it as an out-and-out parody, it needs to be funnier than this."
"If the world really is going to end in my lifetime, these were 145 minutes that I'm never getting back."
"I could only bear 35 minutes, and I haven't walked out of anything since 'You, Me and Dupree.'"
"About the best thing one can say about this fiasco is that Webb has taken only two films to reach the same exhausted, exhausting endpoint that Raimi required three to achieve. It's progress, of a sort."
"If it's a relic you're determined to catch at the movies this week, check out Edmond."
"Radcliffe is to be commended for pulling off a physically demanding role with a sly sense of humor...but ""Swiss Army Man"" is the germ of a good idea trampled by Daniels whose love of fart jokes is an overused gimmick that swamps their story."
"As with too many studio pics, plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure."
The whole movie turns into a slaughterhouse. The question isn't who wants it-box office action is assured-but who needs it?
"If for any reason your wife or girlfriend - or both - try to drag you to this thing, break up with them instead. It would be less painful."
Steve Carell is perilously close to becoming Robin Williams.
The 1860s New York sets in Gangs of New York are amazing. Too bad the dull characters keep blocking our view of them.
"This genial Western comedy is a disappointing successor, not a sequel, to Support Your Local Sheriff."
Creaks along with some highs but many more lows.
This is the most soppy and unsexy 18-certificate skin-flick ever made.
It relies solely on the gimmick that it's funny to have an ex-President using a silver-coated axe to fight mythical creatures. There's nothing else there.
"Largely terrible, with the kernel of something interesting in the film's final scenes."
"Watching the film is often frustrating, but only because it surrounds its interesting subject with half-baked narrative devices, none of which accentuate his story, so much as they drown it out."
"My eyes are still burning from... the horrible racial, cultural, and gender stereotypes of the 1960s [and the] weirdly, disturbingly human-ish flies..."
An inability to crack the movie's central mystery -- why abandon your dreams to help facilitate someone else's? -- leaves the project feeling a bit like a missed opportunity.
"...mean spirited, uncomfortable, and in poor taste..The Littlest Reich is not a toy box audiences-and especially longtime Puppet Master  fans-are going to want to play in."
"Drive My Car certainly has admirable qualities. Those qualities, however, are too frequently pushed aside in favor of material that could easily have been trimmed with no discernible negative impact."
"Romanticizing an intimate relationship that leaves bruises and scars is a particularly terrible idea in a film aimed at girls. Talking about this is tiresome, but then so is putting it in the movie."
"To paraphrase Groucho Marx, this is a movie where we watch Will Smith, Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, Helen Mirren, Naomie Harris, Keira Knightley and several other fine players bore holes in themselves so that we can watch the sap run out."
Julianne Moore's talent is simply too heavy for her to rise above this quicksand comedy.
"All [Shyamalan's] films, to their credit, have been unswervingly sincere. But the primary problem is that this movie is so earnest, you can't help but gag on it."
"Call the movie a pleasant near-miss, see it with your expectations lowered and by all means read the books again."
"In the end The Golden Compass is another expensive mishmash of CGI 'magic' and widescreen spectacle: well-acted, as you would expect, but more or less empty of anything to provoke the curiosity and intelligence of a young audience."
A phoned-in ode to lazy comedy and staggering stupidity.
...a smug little documentary...
"...a thrill ride, running on an empty tank."
"It's certainly possible to be impressed by the film's seriousness and by its terrific cast. But the more you think about it, the more you notice unfulfilled potential."
"Just as we're reaching for our coats so we can beat the rush to the parking lot, the movie launches a new chapter."
The most unintentionally hilarious film so far this year.
"Douglas makes smarm a chewy pleasure, but this is a noir in search of a hero we can root for because we actually buy what he's doing."
"Mark Wahlberg is convincing and committed as a foul-mouthed Father, but this is ultimately just religious propaganda — preaching exclusively to the converted."
The mood is so dour; this solemness-suffused film feels stiff and sad. Even the waves on the beach seem joyless and duty-bound.
Surprisingly flat.
"Piles cliches atop cliches with an end result of mush - not content to be the story of a dramatic rescue, it's also a conspiracy movie and a revenge thriller."
"Unfortunately, the story of seductive and manipulated high school students tries to be a little too dark for its own good, focusing on its characters' evil qualities and ignoring any trace of humanity."
"There's something about A Wrinkle in Time overall that doesn't take flight. It doesn't fall to the ground, either, just sort of hovers when it should soar."
"Tacking on a bunch of pretentious voice-over nonsense about angels and self-realization doesn't get Snyder off the hook for a movie that doesn't realize how wrongheaded, humorless and offensive it really is."
"An unusually pitched portrait of a culinary genius from the Gordon Ramsay school of shouty chefs who needs to learn to, like, chill out. But that high energy never fully translates to the screen."
It&apos;s one of the worst movies ever made from a Stephen King novel&#46;
A black comedy triggered with snide Guy Ritchie type of lowbrow British humor that is not as clever as it thinks it is.
"Much like its titular character, the film itself has some serious growing up to do and needs a strong dose of warmth and charisma."
"A lack of pace and illuminating insight are what keep ""Concussion"" from lasting resonance, its flaws threatening to dull the issue for drama in a way that the NFL could only appreciate."
"The makers of Chuck & Larry probably think they've accomplished something meaningful, but what they've really done is make a gay Soul Man."
It's just a dumb Hollywood film.
Disney's right to just ignore it; I wish I could advise you not to do the same.
"Its competent at best but declines to dig beneath the surface at every turn, almost skittish about any sense of emotion or death beyond the lavishly superficial. What remains in its wake is ambient niceness. But nice is different than good."
"Columbus can shake it up with as much mayhem as his heart desires, but the movie always settles back down to the same static scene."
"The mundanity of the everyday is examined, but do you really want to watch someone slowly making a bed?"
"It doesn't help that Manny, Diego and Sid are among the most boring characters to lead a franchise in recent times."
Logic and authenticity are thrown out the window in this predictable romantic comedy.
A mega-budget reboot that's embarrassed of the TV show it's bringing to the big screen.
"Chalamet scowlingly hints at a slow-burning inner violence, but he doesn't have enough variety to his facial and vocal repertoire to make his character really breathe, either as Henry or Hal."
Destined for drunk-watching with your friends.
"It's admirable that Johansson should be so willing to go off the Hollywood grid, but the truth is, ""Under the Skin"" would have been a lot better if it wasn't so excruciatingly arty."
Such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show.
"Unfortunately, they didn't get the story right. The first three-quarters of the film is very predictable. And, despite a couple of nice twists in the last act, it's not enough to counterbalance that predictability."
"Rod Serling would have wrapped this mysterioso story about a psychiatrist and a suicidal patient dislocated by time, space and a lot of crazily raked angles into a tight half-hour episode."
"I'm certainly not a fan of Space Jam, but it's hard to deny its rich tapestry of questionable ideas."
The celluloid equivalent of Jokey Smurf.
"Like the film, Jordin Sparks is decidedly too wholesome and earnest to leave much of an impression."
"The character dynamics are intriguing in this intimate drama, although some heavy-handed contrivances diminish the emotional impact."
I can't imagine Road Runner was what Chen had in mind for the most expensive movie ever made in China...
"It's hard to take the film seriously with [its] contrivances, including a hokey music score, dialogue designed solely to give us historical information."
A phony-baloney trivialization of the title epic poem and its important moment in American cultural history...
"...a neither here-nor-there Christmas holiday tent pole that, however well crafted, does not do its pedigree justice."
"A former Olympian with fertility issues, Connie has a compelling backstory, but Bell is not an especially compelling presence here - a rare misfire from an actor typically bursting with charisma."
"When the film sticks to action, it's on firm ground."
"Inane, inorganic and predictable from the start."
The relentless carnage grows numbing and unwholesome.
"Lorna's Silence doesn't work, but it's a beautiful misfire."
"This WWI melodrama is bursting with ideas and energy but void of such concepts as consistency, subtlety, credibility."
It feels like a pale and empty outline of a stereotypical 90's-era serial killer thriller.
"Hackford's never been much good at pacing, and the film sort of sloshes from one scene to the next, which calls greater attention to its considerable flab - it's full of full scenes and subplots that could disappear without any real damage."
The Invention of Lying is an underdeveloped work from an overindulged comic.
Too conscious of its own self...
"Fox's latest Marvel movie is no fantastic failure like Fantastic Four, but it doesn't inspire any enthusiasm for future installments."
"Even over the short running time, you can feel your humanity's diminishment."
Suicide Squad falls remarkably short.
"The two leads are not inspired. Jake Gyllenhaal could make the cover of a muscle mag, but he plays Dastan as if harboring Spider-Man's doubts and insecurities. I recall Gemma Arterton as resembling a gorgeous still photo in a cosmetics ad."
"A haunted house that's alive, uproots itself, and storms down the street on a rampage seems a bit over-stimulating for young children."
"While the original is an exploration of folklore and urban legends and the second continues those themes, the third gets lost in its attempt to translate these ideas elsewhere."
This blazingly irreverent comedy hits its machismo targets over and over again to the point of overkill.
"The original at least had a pretty cool maze, unfortunately now they have taken it because apocalyptic zombie scenarios sell more. Yawn"
Longer on calculating sourness than on psychologically organic wit.
"MacFarlane is a joke machine. They come fast and furious, and often they're insanely funny. The bad news? His stories tend to suffer for it."
"...lets off the hook the greedy ****ers responsible for exploiting the lower classes, effectively tossing pebbles at its targets when it should be heaving boulders."
"Truly a five-car pileup of a comedy, with jokes hitting the lowest common denominator and then hitting the ground, and a director at the helm who doesn't seem to know the first thing about his craft."
"""We're the Filler"" might have been a more apt title ..."
This movie is important because of its many innovations. It's also notable because it's one of the most outright racist films ever to come out of Hollywood.
There's something hollow beneath its polished surface.
"The movie is a numbskull insult to gay people. Just on the basis of the mirthless trailer, however, they'll probably ignore it. I doubt they'll be alone."
The Perfect Storm is as detached and mechanical as a production of Moby Dick staged by the Weather Channel.
"""Get Smart"" largely sinks because it's an ""action comedy"" in which neither the action nor the comedy particularly works."
"Given its very narrow focus, there are scenes that feel repetitive as we continually watch Churchill argue with others and look deep within himself."
The luxurious Cte d'Azur town has never seemed so dull.
"Director Udayan Prasad knows how to maximize tight spaces and closed-up characters, but Stewart underwhelms with her churlish pout and Southern twang, while Redmayne is simply annoying."
Godzilla: God of the Monsters fails to deliver on the promise of an epic monster film.
Brittany Snow and Sam Richardson can only do so much in this predictable and stale rom-com. [Full review in Spanish]
"There have been several striking films about the world of comedy. Robert De Niro was even in one of them...and Mike Birbiglia's sharply observed Don't Think Twice from last year is well worth seeking out. Unfortunately, The Comedian is not one of them."
The Union of Fog Machine Operators can be proud of its contributions to this yawner.
A frustrating exercise in terror that relies too heavily on gimmicks to have any genuine impact.
"It's so unbelievably and egregiously bad, you have to wonder if they did it on purpose."
"The themes are universal, even trite, but the details are authentic and specific."
"Valerian and the Needlessly Long Title defies our instinct for something, anything to make sense. Besson's parade of soul melds and virtual realities is complexity camouflaging the fact that little happens... a hamster wheel, motion going nowhere."
Almost everyone here seems at least a little cartoonlike.
"Fails as entertainment, being so ineptly directed and written it often has the feel of a high school production by kids with more money and ambition than talent."
"Rough even by Russell's standards, this grab bag of dropped plot points, visual metaphors, and theatrical cues looks like the underdrawing of a comic drama, only half covered in bright impasto strokes."
"Me, I would rather have enjoyed a big breakfast."
I cannot say The Djinn did much for me.
"Like most of these sofa-spud comedies, Anchorman bears its attention-deficit disorder proudly, as it shifts tone and abruptly sidetracks."
"Pitched halfway between legitimately self-aware slasher camp and--shudder--a sincere relationship thriller, Homecoming hardly seems worth the hour-and-half effort at first."
"We'll eventually see dozens if not hundreds of projects using the pandemic as a plot point. ""Songbird"" will be among the least memorable."
"Unfortunately, its screenplay doesn't hold up to the beautiful production design and the gorgeous cinematography. [Full review in Portuguese.]"
Not terribly convincing as a cautionary tale&#44; but it does give Mr&#46; Philipponnat the opportunity to emote&#8212;or overemote&#8212;to an extraordinary degree&#46;            
We are not amused.
"Malgré ses qualités, non négligeables, ce remake demeure inférieur à l'original, comme c'est souvent le cas. [Full review in French]"
The first and last quarters show real ambition. It's the middle hour that's a drag.
"Happy Feet Two is the kind of movie that won't make you scream in pain while you're watching it, and that won't prompt you to remember much about it once it's over."
"You see Robin Williams and psycho killer, and you think, hmmmmm. You see the movie and you think, zzzzzzzzz."
"Cute, cloying and catastrophically predictable."
"The intentions...are good, and the picture boasts a fine lead performance, but ultimately...it's just a fancy disease-of-the-week movie that comes off confused and overly cute."
Not too subtle hard-hitting feminist revenge tale over domestic abuse.
"Glug glug glug, jugs jugs jugs. Ugh."
"There is potential in Unlovable (...) As it stands, however, the film feels like a missed opportunity."
"... Splashy, oppressive portrait of Marilyn Monroe."
The Ruins offers further proof that what works on the printed page doesn't necessarily work on the big screen.
Director Stephen Frears reunites with his Philomena writing team&#44; who include the actor&#47;comedian Steve Coogan&#44; and they pad out a thin story with flourishes that no actor&#44; no matter how charming&#44; can sell&#46;
"Tougher-minded children among us may find it hard to sit, without embarrassment, through this bizarre mixture of paleontology, preposterous anthropomorphism, and fuzzy-headed New Age myth-making."
The central performances are compelling but the two American characters are wholly unconvincing.
...could have used more movie-specific discussions of the aesthetic implications of celluloid versus digital.
The result would have been different if De Laurentiis gave the final cut to Lynch. [Full review in Spanish]
McGuigan's callow actors (it bears noting that the original French cast has an average of 10 years on the young Americans) have nothing to bring to their one-attribute characters ... and the agonies of cartoons don't amount to much.
"It's as if Greenaway had all this artistry, including his own, at his disposal and created nothing but a dead piece of meat, for no reason in particular--unless it's to express his contempt for his audience."
"Austenland embraces convention, and the result is a romantic comedy in which the ending seems not just foreordained, but promised via contract from the first moment of the film."
Feels pedestrian and uninspired where Halloween felt fresh and terrifying
Director Thomas seems committed to maintaining a status quo with King&apos;s novel and a significant nod to the &apos;84 film&#44; but to a surprisingly lesser effect&#46;
"The ending, which will not be discussed here, is jaw-droppingly stupid. ""Gone"" is a slow-moving thriller that doesn't make sense. Paul Chambers, CNN."
There are some fine actors aboard The Commuter ... but they're obliterated amid the carriage carnage and cheap lines. This film is expensive-looking trash.
"It is not quite violent, drunken, or naked enough to be as trashily entertaining as the Patrick Swayze cult favorite Roadhouse."
Confused at its core and too befuddled to make that a virtue.
"Unfortunately, though visually sumptuous, the film is a cold dish."
"I Spy is ample reminder that memorable comedy is, in its own way, as tricky to pull off as a good party."
A complete miscalculation on what will interest and entertain the consumer&#44; there isn&apos;t a single reason why one should give the film the time of day and truly it does deserve to be lost how it has been&#46; 
"All the outright silliness can be quite entertaining, but it's unsatisfying to watch a movie spend so much time developing characters you can't possibly care about as you wait for Emmerich to throw in the next wave of destruction."
"Speedway is pleasant, kind, polite, sweet and noble, and if the late show viewers of 1988 will not discover from it what American society was like in the summer of 1968, at least they will discover what it was not like."
"By reaching for lofty ideas that never feel within its grasp, it sacrifices its beating, human heart."
A movie with all the urgency of J. Paul Getty when he's informed his grandson has been kidnapped.
"As long as festival selection committees go on including films like In the Fade in their rosters and a certain segment of the public remains conned, Akin will continue to churn out more of these self-important turkeys."
"Scott Cooper makes the deeds of Bulger and his Winter-Hill gang a depressing roster of slightly escalating crimes-not only does crime not pay, it's not very much fun."
"The fusion of effects-fueled action fantasy with comedy worked well for director Ivan Reitman 22 years ago in Ghostbusters and, less so, five years ago in Evolution. But, it fails to save his latest, My Super Ex-Girlfriend."
This may be the worst film of Spielberg's career...
"The shame is, the cast here would have been good enough for a straight-up adaptation of Hamlet."
"The early scenes promise a potentially novel cross between heist and extreme horror, but those hopes are quickly dashed."
"""Listen Up Philip"" wants to say something meaningful about human relationships. But like a frustrated writer staring at a blank piece of paper, the words just never appear."
I found it mildly amusing. I didn't hate it.
"You find yourself rooting for these women, even if their adventures aren't always up to snuff."
"Overscored and overwrought, The Normal Heart is a tough pill to swallow. The direction of Ryan Murphy (Glee) is piercingly staccato (and visually inconsistent). The tender moments don't resonate, and the fraught moments feel hysterical."
The film certainly makes its point - that a risk-averse life of unending luxury is no life at all - but it makes it so listlessly that you really won't care.
More Tom and Jerry than Thelma and Louise.
The themes are set up and then completely pushed into the background in exchange for almost endless dribble that feels more like a first time attempt of a film student rather than an actual film...
"Ultimately, the emphasis on flash disengages viewers from the story's emotional core, which is the exact opposite of what Larson intended."
"A combination road movie, musical excursion, and comedy is marred by the tedious bickering of the two lead characters."
Sanitized to the point of disinterest... it's unwilling to penetrate the creativity and attitude behind kids' attraction to dance.
"Staying true to its real-life scenario, the film gets mired in the inevitable red tape of police investigations, [and it] switches focus enough times to make you think it's three movies instead of one."
"Singh's features never achieve a critical feel of humanity, always cold to the touch. They are museum pieces meant to be acknowledged, not necessarily enjoyed."
"fast-paced, sloppy, and pretty dumb, but it's over quickly"
"The sloppiness of the cops-and-robbers games starts to feel pointless, even as it remains generally compelling. Everyone in Triple 9 ultimately feels a bit like a supporting character -- even the filmmakers."
"A tangled and pedestrian narrative gets in the way of the thrills, which are still considerable."
The film gives the feeling that is longer than it actually is. In the end is the typical summer film: strident and empty. [Full review in Spanish]
Crimson Peak would have been a wonderful silent film.
"Too low-key to seize hold of the imagination, 'American Gangster' is divided against itself, stylistically and story-wise."
Ozon makes it exceedingly difficult to feel anything for his protagonists.
"I don't see how I can come out ahead panning Star Wars, George Lucas's science-fiction film that has been acclaimed by children of all ages as the Fun Movie of the year."
Good in the way that makes it worth catching on basic cable during the commercial breaks of something better.
Settles for a weak trajectory that isn't good enough to be weird.
"Everything %u2013 but everything %u2013 happens in such a mind-numbingly by-the-numbers fashion that the Batman-ripoff ending is apt to generate not awe, but an outburst of, 'That's it?'"
Sorely lacks is a genuine sense of humanity.
This repetitive and poorly plotted production fails to engage.
"One can actually feel the strain of the production as it dreams up something to do with a thin concept, throwing anything at the screen to see what sticks."
"Hayek is a standard-issue femme fatale, damaged on the inside but flawless on the surface."
"A more conventional outing than its predecessor, but actually a more likable picture, even if it's of no more than cable-TV quality."
"The subject matter screams out for cleverness and depth, the sort of mind-bending twists and satisfying darkness that Poe himself would love. It finds them only in small doses."
"..spins and whirls and sputters and wheezes, but never at exactly the right moments."
The Emoji Movie certainly ain't getting a positive review from me. But it never made me actually angry...
"This is nothing but a vanity project, relying on the conceit that Anne has been unfairly languishing in her husband's shadow. Eleanor Coppola must have made many sacrifices for her husband's art, but with Paris Can Wait the sacrifice is all ours."
The Purge is satire done so broadly that the audience might forget that it is trying to comment on something with weight and meaning.
"""The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"" doesn't know whether it's a drama, a comedy, or a random slice-of-life expose. Neither will you."
"The story is so wispy that it feels only half-written; basically, nothing much happens here. Not a total washout, but it seems more like a TV movie."
"Killer Elite is distinguished by one no-mercy, eye-gouging, testicle-punching brawl, and one whoppingly indifferent screenplay."
"The Darkest Minds is badly edited and lacks a cohesive flow. Readers of the book will know the setup, but it's a head scratcher for us neophytes."
I'm not saying superhero movies or comic book movies can't have the range. I'm just saying I'm not sure that Snyder does.
"The enemies are merely repetitive opportunities for over-the-top, realism-devoid, gravity-defying stunts and action sequences to play out, one after the next."
"It suffers, like many blockbusters, from too much spectacle and not enough truth, but its greatest sin is that it feels dull, insipid and underwhelming despite a plethora of loud action scenes and dazzling visual effects."
"This film makes such firefighters into cartoons, which ill serves their legacy."
This film is like the Instagram-influencer version of [Beasts of a Southern Wild] — a Goop post about its beautifying effects.
"By the time we see sword fights onboard airships, the movie finally realizes what it needs to be -- goofy, silly fun. Too bad that comes after 90 minutes of failed opportunities."
A butch and uncompromising assault of mediocrity and dj vu.
"Deep's intriguing premise is squandered by a cheesy script, bizarre pacing, and forgettable performances."
The film's ruefully honest tone is periodically drowned out by the blare of stagey coincidences.
"Impressive as it is in scale, Batman v Superman is exhausting. Snyder wants you to feel the pain when the two heroes are clobbering each other, and you will. If that's what you crave from movies, have at it."
"Though the picture is admirable on a conceptual level, its execution is incoherent, interminable and a colossal strain on the eyes."
"There are a few quality moments, but this fairy tale is far from enchanting."
"A pretentious bore...a rambling, repetitive road movie that purports to say something deep about the nation's youth and its class system."
"At a time when television is easier to make than films, it's a pity that a quart of plot in a pint-sized pot is largely to blame for this muddled misfire, which wastes some promising ideas and an impressive cast."
"The romance between them is touching at its best moments, corny at its worst."
It's serviceable entertainment with solid acting.
...a frustratingly uneven bit of over-the-top filmmaking...
"The writing clunks; the narrative is contrived and unconvincing and the whole film has a strange pass-agg body language, as if it is handling its own painful subject matter with kid gloves and asking us to do the same."
"The Olympian peak of Hollywood creative bankruptcy, a sequel to a remake of a movie that wasn't that good to begin with - executed as a special-effects demo reel in the place of actual entertainment."
This one's for Deadheads and dawg-lovers only.
"For those who've waited 20 years for another expert combination of social satire and zombie action, Land is a serious disappointment."
"U2, notoriously tight with the rights to their music and image, were reportedly so impressed by the script that they allowed their music and some concert footage to be used for very cheap. They got gypped."
"Follows is an effective pastiche but a studied one; by the end, even its ambiguities feel overdetermined."
It just didn't speak to me. I thought it was way too long and a little too slow in pace.
"Drag Me to Hell can't quite live up to the Evil Dead movies, mostly because it never finds a consistent tone. Not to mention, its background mythology is both totally ridiculous and almost impossible to understand."
Some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations.
"A crude piece of work, spottily acted and directed."
This admiring yet sluggish movie mostly drowns its political revelations in sticky sentiment.
"Continues the mopey saga of sparkly vampires, shirtless werewolves and a heroine so cloyingly vapid she makes Carrie Bradshaw seem generous and self-aware."
"Is there any way of stemming the flow of post-Guy Ritchie cockney crime comedies? Would, say, sticking Danny Dyer's head on a pike somewhere in Bethnal Green be enough of a deterrent? Because I for one would be willing to pay that price."
This micro-budgeted indie tries to appeal to everyone by not offending anyone... except those who like movies.
Not so thrilled about the way every female seemed like a caricature-all of them needing a man to validate them in some way; all of them seeming incomplete until McBurney.
"Like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive, fitfully amusing, but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen."
"A lumpy blend of sweet teen romance and naughty, R-rated prurience, this comedy follows the improbable relationship between a high school senior and a former porn star."
"Even though it is quite a loyal adaptation of the classic tale, A Christmas Carol doesn't quite manage to land as a Disney film. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Ends better than it begins -- or middles.
"In the big cosmic picture, it feels trivial. And maybe it's also this: in the current reality of 21st-century life, we've had our fill of science trumped by sentiment."
"Shaft plays more like an Expendables version of the original films, a shadow of its former self that revels in a cartoonishly hyper-masculine nostalgia of a bygone era."
"Everything is painfully set up and contrived, while almost none of it seems even passingly real. In its favor, however, the movie looks good and the stars are appealing."
"The movie's predictable wind-down and ho-hum twist at the end make this Life hardly worth living. In space, no one can hear you yawn."
"Goya's Ghosts is Milos Forman's first film since 1999, but you sincerely wish it wasn't. A logy, rambling period piece, it feels about as far away from the spirit of Amadeus as it's possible to get with wigs and britches."
"Viewers will either be all in to see if love wins out, or they will have turned ""LUZ"" off long before then."
Great-looking leads in a silly showcase
"Howl is a disappointingly mundane movie about a vibrant, iconoclastic subject."
"Its attempts at broad comedy too often feel like the characters are drawn around the pratfalls, rather than the other way around."
"The stars and director are back but the thrill is gone, replaced by a muttonheaded script and slapstick comedy that starts in hectic mode and quickly strips its gears."
"Director Clint Eastwood, brings his story to the big screen with the mushy simplicity of creamed corn."
"Point Break soon becomes a mixture of spectacle and discomfort, with striking scenery, eye-catching stunts and awkward performances."
"A film that can be described using a term that Jobs spits out with palpable distaste as ""the worst thing you can say"" about anything undertaken by Apple: ""It's fine."""
Franchises don't work if the movie improves when the main character is offscreen.
"By and large, English-Canadian filmmakers need to hear one thing: if you don't have a budget, don't try so damn hard!"
Rupert Friend plays an assassin even deadlier than Homeland's Peter Quinn... But his very indestructibility means the story's formulaic action never gets particularly gripping.
"Paul Bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe, but the movie is certainly not number 1."
Keanu Reeves's latest is the perfect example of what not to do in this genre. [Full Review in Spanish]
"This is a film that had a great deal potential, but got too involved in its action scenes."
"strips Cassidy of the myth, reminding us that even Paul Newman couldn't escape old age."
"Jane Eyre with William Hurt as Rochester sounds dicey enough, but the last thing you expect from Zeffirelli's latest is a Jane without juice."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq. has pockets of intrigue, and writer-director Gilroy and Washington have teamed up to create a promising dramatic character. We just never get full delivery on that promise."
"Like the storyline, the visual style eventually becomes more frustrating than rewarding."
"A mess. The screenplay does too much meandering, Norton has to recite bland police procedural details, Fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced, Hopkins looks like a drag queen."
"These jokes are of course tired junk, aiming for the lowest of the low-hanging fruit and still somehow not always hitting their targets."
Better character-connection would inject this well photographed episodic journey around the island with a higher level of dramatic justification.
"[The film is] rendered in a witless, banal environment that makes the whole thing pointless as it creeps to its oddly conformist conclusions."
"Though Stopkewich has astutely recognized the contradictions in our uneasy relationship to the dead, she doesn’t seem to have examined her own uneasy relationship to the story she tells."
A film in which grandeur of conception is not up to grandeur of setting.
Parents wishing to protect their beloved daughters from clich overload might do well to withhold the old allowance money for a couple of weeks.
"Ultimately it's just an old-fashioned shocker--'Psycho' crossed with 'Jane Eyre,' and reworked for the teeny-bopper crowd. But it lives up to neither of its exalted models."
"But if you don't mind being taken for a mindless adrenaline ride across the glittering blacktops of Los Angeles, this could be excused as a guilty pleasure treat."
"While the story in this latest adaptation plays out largely the same as the original, it feels problematically dated and not especially funny."
(re)Assignment is one hell of an ugly film and I'm not just talking about its grimy aesthetic.
Paranormal Activity pretends to be a heart-stopping edge of your seat entertainment. It's actually just a homemade horror movie blown all out of proportion by studios sensing a hit.
"To its credit, it remains fairly watchable even as it veers around wildly in tone. Yet Second Act also proves that all-in-one products have their downsides."
"Everything blows up, nothing is at stake and Dom's team looks like the Power Rangers, except more cartoon-like."
Even Nicholson's usually scene-stealing bluster can't get this disappointing addition to the Brooks filmography going.
A 'Carnival of Souls' for Mitch Albom readers...
"The picture is not nearly as deranged as it should've been, trying urgently to stay friendly when a nice shiny set of Verhoeven-sharp fangs would've done the premise more justice."
"[The leads] really deserved more from the director, Peter Howitt and co-writers Aline Brosh McKenna and Robert Harling, who among them come up with less than one serviceable screenplay."
"Saint Bernard is weird for the sake of being weird. There is a specific audience that will revel in that oddity and enjoy the movie strictly on those terms. However, as a film with characters and a story to tell the film falls far short of its goals."
A portrait of the artist as an old fart.
If you're hoping El Chicano might do for the Latino community what Black Panther did for African-American(s) last year by making a positive cultural impact and celebrating representation at the highest levels of Hollywood - don't hold your breath.
"CGI baboons, the wizard's CGI monkey companion and colorful but soulless CGI landscapes of Oz are no substitute for the absence of even one great song and characters who develop the greatest of friendships as they fight the greatest battle of their lives."
An uneven chase movie with a running time of 90 minutes that feels way too long. [Full review in Spanish]
What The Hoax really needs is a storyteller of Irving's imagination and skill to create a lie worth telling and believing.
It might as well have been re-titled Red Herring: The Movie.
"An often insipid, mostly meandering horror/comedy hybrid that's too dumb to really recommend, but oddly endearing enough in the end to render it somewhat dopily palatable."
"Mix 150-proof Victorian romance with some HP (Harry Potter) sauce, add a dash of Munsters humour. . . . The heroine becomes obsessed with surrender and submission to a man constantly tempted to kill her. That's one sucked-up subtext."
Just very silly.
"The film itself, two hours and 20 minutes long, would have benefited from a greater sense of the economy. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The absence of a clear, overriding perspective ultimately renders it a skin-deep portrait."
Carries the leaden whiff of the ghosts of thrillers past.
A minor chiller and major downer from the talented Alexandre Aja.
"The film seems to advocate reason as a good first approach to any problem, and all-out destruction as the next best thing."
All that's truly scary about The Covenant are the words that appear before the title: 'A Renny Harlin Film.'
"Taylor either borrows from the passive savagery of previous Terminator flicks, or lifts shots from competing products. We've seen it all before, but with higher stakes and stronger craft."
Somehow manages to be both louder and dumber than the original.
Right when things begin to get interesting &#8212; when tensions begin to fly&#44; alliances start to crumble &#8212; the film meekly ends&#44; choosing to go out on a note as unremarkable as our lead hero&#8217;s journey&#46;
Neither funny nor particularly scary&#44; the film presents a tonally uneven experience with gritty home-invasion violence on the one hand and kooky creatures taken far too seriously on the other&#46;
"Aside from being annoying, depressing and repulsive, ""Chaos Walking"" has a lot going for it."
Stupid every step of the way.
"Jon M. Chu's weaksauce adaptation of the 1980s Hasbro toy turned cartoon not only fails resoundingly as a film, it also fails as a nostalgia piece -- which, honestly, might be the greater sin in today's pop cultureverse."
Seven Psychopaths is one of those movies that's too cute by half.
"Endings/Beginnings swerves toward an uplifting and positive conclusion doesn't feel natural or earned. By then, one can only hope those familiar, poorly lit faces made the viewing worthwhile."
"It's clear director Shane Salerno is an admirer of Salinger, but his movie has no patience for the writer's work."
This new take on Charlie's Angels seems confused about what exactly it wants to say and thus intrigues audiences with items that aren't explicitly the Angels themselves.
"Nanjiani and Bautista are clearly having a blast, but their easy chemistry is at the mercy of a depressingly formulaic buddy-actioner script. It's watchable, for sure, but is that really good enough with this much talent involved?"
The low-budget film relies on character authenticity but ultimately requires too much suspension of disbelief.
"While Gondry calms his creative instincts to toy with the ordinary, he indirectly errs on making ""Microbe and Gasoline"" his first forgettable film."
"As the sulking, moody male hustler in the title role, [Franco] has all of Dean's mannerisms and self-indulgence, but none of his sweetness and vulnerability."
"At the end, theater exit signs are welcome beacons."
This really is the schlockiest and cringiest sequel ever.
"Despite the best efforts of the technical crew, the film would have faltered in the hands of lesser actors. You only sit through it because the Manoj, Tabu and Annu never let you down and hold your attention throughout."
"Gives you the creeps, the giggles and the groans in almost equal measure."
"The filmmakers try really hard to be hip and inventive but aren't. Steve Buscemi, Fred Willard, and M. Emmet Walsh are among the indie casualties."
The filmmakers are themselves too celebrity besotted to comment in a meaningful way on how Benson's career balanced depictions of the rich and famous with in-the-trenches risk-taking.
The B-team version of the story.
Coriolanus fails to successfully create a believable environment for this verbose narrative to exist.
"Son of God takes no real chances, opting for a moderately involving re-telling of an oft-told story."
Shaft doesn't begin its radical downfall until it moves into a midsection that grows more and more tedious as time progresses...
"[T]he whole enterprise feel[s] indulgent, a vanity project for one of Netflix's biggest stars and not one that demands in any real way to exist."
"Camcorded, Suffolk-set drivel about four friends drawn to a haunted tree."
"The frights, the archetypes, even the predictability of it all is predictable, leaving behind a dull, brainless novelty that makes more sense as a TV sweeps stunt."
The simple-minded presentation ultimately makes it ring hollow.
The result is disappointing.
A toothless and nearly laughless buddy comedy.
"The movie squanders its potential with a sloppy script chock full of false notes. Even the bumptious score intrudes, often bumping into important dialogue."
"You can't really fault Lord & Miller and their team for going all out in an attempt to entertain us, but The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part is more of an exhausting experience than a truly enjoyable one."
"I'm sorry, that's the point of the film...I know we're supposed to be annoyed by her, but not this damn much."
"All said, the film shapes up as a mildly entertaining missed opportunity, notable for its performances, especially Bernal's."
"TURISTAS seemed to have a fascinating, cautionary premise,but in execution, the movie turned out to be messy and decidedly unmemorable."
"Essentially, The Misfits is a desert-set Ocean's 11 knock-off, presumably made for an audience of the very young, drunk or recently concussed."
Geared to know-nothings who not only haven't read the original novel but haven't seen any of the other Musketeer films.
"The film isn't terrible, but it's hard to shake the feeling that we're being robbed of an important story for this moment."
"What button, on whose box, did Kelly push to get the money to make this awful, preposterous thriller?"
"The film wants so badly to craft her into something universally appealing, when all it had to do was just let her be herself."
Insipid black comedy about suburban materialism and murder.
"OK, we've seen the biceps and the abs. Very nice. Now, back to the brain."
a movie that doesn't need an audience--just a box of tissues and some lotion. That anxiety you get is the dawning realization that the movie kind of wants to be by itself.
"Kudos to Eastwood for good intentions, but stories, like trains, need a dependable surface. This train is running on jointed tracks."
There are some laughs to be had along the constructed way but the minuses outweigh the pluses and the whole female police mismatch was done better in The Heat with Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy.
"An overwrought, ramshackle weepie."
"This has not a single ounce of the charm that you might find in LOVE, ACTUALLY or a number of other films revolving around romance. It's just plain bad."
"Noah Bambauch makes it easy to dislike his films. Problem is, he also makes it easy for New York's media elite to praise them."
"Engaging enough though a mess historically, but runs out of gas-or hot air-before a strenuously triumphant finale."
Plodding account of how a rebel uprising led by Sun Yat-Sen helped overthrow the Qing dynasty in China.
It's just not stirring enough as historical drama.
"I have seen worse films, but I'm not sure I've seen a worse performance. And that's really saying something."
Puts the viewer in the middle of flailing truncheons and tumbling bodies without necessary context.
"O'Shea works hard to find a denouement which will tie up all the loose ends and lend The Transfiguration suitable pathos. Sadly, one can't help but wonder if it would make Milo's video library."
"An ugly film dressed up in a cheap suit, the flaccid Kingsman is less biting, transgressive Bond tribute, and more akin to a gorier, swearier Stormbreaker."
"Take a dash of Cinderella, add various safe, predictable, cute scenes, a couple of funny characters, plenty of Pretty Woman make-up."
"The one-dimensional, nearly cartoonish antagonists and the fact that there's never any shade of doubt about what verdict the jury will deliver means the dramatic suspense remains flat. (Full Content Review for Parents Also Available)"
"Internal Affairs is all stylish visuals and no substance whatsoever. That may be an attempt to hide the silliness of Henry Bean's first-time screenplay, but it doesn't work."
"This is a film at odds with itself, wanting to be a 99 percenter rallying cry but wallowing in and fetishizing 1 percenter accoutrement at every turn."
"There's no jaw-dropping scene...the movie's biggest flaw is that it tries to do too much, and it overreaches."
"I couldn't decide if ""TrollHunter"" was trying to be funny or scary, but I can tell you it succeeds at neither."
Allen seems utterly convinced of the film's comic value and novelty by extending what are essentially lame skits to a nauseatingly long running-time.
I feel pretty dumb for having had such high hopes for this one.
It can not make up its mind if it is a movie for the early teen set or its target audience is grownups.
"It comes off as hagiographic, tamping down van Gogh's dark side so that he can fill out the ""tortured artist"" trope to the letter."
Waterston and Kirby manage to convey the stilted English of the era and I did believe they shared a special rapport. But the roles of the husbands are practically non-existent.
The start of a great movie.
"Regrettably, Widows forgets that it is - first and foremost - supposed to be a believable heist flick."
"For all of Glover's substantial achievements, [Guava Island] is shockingly facile and utterly limited in perspective."
"""Seven Days to Live"" is an OK country song, packed with faith, family and fighting for what's important. Oh, wait, that's what ""Premonition"" should have been, instead of a preposterous thriller that wastes Sandra Bullock's time, and ours."
"Although Watson Watt's project is always in danger of being axed, the film lacks credible tension."
"A film with lots of potential that ends up short. Feels like a thin ""Cliff Notes"" versión of the whole (book) series. [Full review in Spanish]"
"There is a lazy, wine-soaked charm between the two leads, but ultimately there is no tension or interest in their ""wacky"" road trip."
The clichés just pile up and there is little attempt made to deviate from formula. (Full Parental Review also available)
It looked and felt and seemed a lot better than it really is. 
"As it is A Very Murray Christmas wants to come off as unique and effortless as its host, simultaneously sad, pensive, spirited and off-the-cuff, but too often it feels as forced and uncomfortable as the Internet's cult of Murray."
"After the commercial and critical success of How to Train Your Dragon, which elevated the usual father-son tale, Megamind's shortcomings seem even worse by comparison."
It's not a film to watch when you're tired.
The film backs itself into a corner when it must choose between either being relentlessly nasty or suddenly heartwarming.
"The movie is Bat-s--t crazy. A dour, disdain-filled demeanor, plus a gluttony of complex plot twists, dissipates most of the contact high."
Multinational corporate terrorism as narrative second fiddle to mock sleuthing around via poetry and existential sweet nothings dropped into a voice concealment cell phone device. The Caller: Dial-up assisted suicide by gumshoe.
The movie doesn't have half the personality of the average hound - or even the most entitled housecat.
"The Coopers go through the motions of saying lines and emoting feelings, but they come off as authentic as a tinsel Christmas tree."
Worse than unwatchable.
"essentially a futuristic Night of the Living Dead without the social commentary, pacing, or interesting characters"
Isn't as clever or as timely as it clearly perceives itself.
"The offbeat comedy is not entirely devoid of charm, but its derivativeness is almost embarrassing."
If I may offer Savage and his returning Host co-writers Gemma Hurley and Jed Shepherd a piece of unsolicited advice: log out.
The other problem with this cinematic adaptation is that dialogue and believable plotting are not Owens&#8217; strength&#44; so this suffocatingly faithful rendition imports all the source&#8217;s flaws intact&#46;
[Bavo Defurne] lacks the mordacity and inventiveness to live up to [the film's] ambitious purpose. [Full Review in Spanish]
"The 2016 book which many turned to as an explanation for Trumpism has been turned into a contradictory and culturally bland adaptation by ""The Shape of Water's"" Vanessa Taylor."
One to miss.
"'Alien Trespass' is neither soulless nor bad. Yet it does not improve on the sources that inspire it, so why not watch them instead?"
"If a movie is going to tell yet another story about life during World War II, it better be a lot more special than this one."
Pathetic acting and a scattershot plot sink this pitiful attempt by producer Robert Stigwood to turn the landmark Beatles album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band into an engaging film.
How much more stuff do we need to see getting blown up?
"So when you sit in this movie and can count on one hand the number of times you laugh, it's disappointing, especially when it's the same joke repeated over and over and over again."
The desperation apparent in Affleck's bug-eyed attempts at whimsy may be the most uncomfortable aspect of Surviving Christmas.
"The scenery looks nice and she and Arnaud try hard to make it all appear less dopey than it actually is, but the end result is fairly laboured and forgettable."
An underwhelming blockbuster that takes itself and its dour characters too seriously.
"The basic problem of ""Vanilla"" is not its adherence to the earlier movie, however. It's the stifling air of emotional detachment that hangs over the entire film; next to this, Cruise's similar ""Eyes Wide Shut"" looks downright heartwarming."
"Ask any high school teacher - or, for that matter, any high schooler - and they'll tell you the surest way to get two teenagers to fall in love is to tell them they can't see each other."
"The film just kind of sits there, gradually escalating a zombie apocalypse and hoping that having the zombies retain a smidgen of humanity as they turn homicidal will somehow automatically yield hilarity and poignancy."
"Most of the echoes are stirred up from earlier, better movies."
Hopelessly convoluted and vague.
"1 Plexiglas ball sporting 1 hamster was fine for Disney's Bolt. Along comes Bruckheimer -- now it's 3 Plexiglas balls with 4 hamsters, er, guinea pigs, and 1 Transformer. Seems he's hell bent on excess."
"It is, at the end of the day, a body positivity film telling you that you need makeup to feel confident."
Need for Speed celebrates reckless driving with the bloodless consequences of an Xbox game rated for 10-year-olds. (Little wonder: The 3-D film is loosely adapted from the video racing series of the same name.)
Will probably play best to fanboys who love Power Rangers and Ultraman.
"This unpretentious, bottom-feeding boo! ride reminds us that nothing--including games of our childhood--is safe from being plundered and yanked into a place of nightmares."
"By the end, I was ready to hop in my own car and do 200 MPH out of the parking lot."
"Block intended this movie as a loving portrait of his relationship with his daughter. Instead, it's a reflection, and not always a kind one, of the man behind the camera."
A movie that ought to entice people to want to travel with Gulliver instead inveigles them to run from him.
"The film is bare and ravaged, and its most haunting moments look casual as well as ominous."
"a solid thriller - until it implodes. It gives you a savory first course, then rudely dumps seconds on your plate, even though you've already lost your appetite."
"What we're left with isn't an embarrassment, but isn't anything for this proud cast to glory in, either."
"This is a by-the-numbers rehash that will leave anyone much over 5 enormously grateful that, if you duck out before the lengthy end credits, it lasts just over an hour."
"What Host really had, and Safer at Home lacks, are credible characters. Instead, we're confronted with the same nonsensical solipsism that made everyone glad that Cloverfield had monsters."
An enigmatic thriller that never quite gets going.
"I would have been happy to just sit back and watch a master filmmaker recreate these events -- maybe five years from now, or ten."
Aronofsky's long-time-coming version of spiritual wonder is finally more mind-numbing than soul-stirring.
"an ill-conceived amalgam of sentiment played sweet not sappy, mixed uncertainly with the standard lower-than-low-brown humor with which Sandler's films . . are saturated"
"For I Hate Valentine's Day, Vardalos has chosen to direct. And that's a mistake that only compounds the ones in her screenplay."
The film celebrates individuality even as it suggests that everyone needs their own A.I. tech to validate everything they like and think.
"It's just another attractive costume drama, with a few sexy scenes thrown in for spice, and a classical music setting that qualifies this as another difficult-to-market artsy film."
"The bleakly savage comedy Observe and Report is very nearly a great, if somewhat disturbing, film. What lets it down is not the gratuitous violence and foul language - it's that it doesn't go far enough."
"Isn't exactly a dull experience, but it is a monotonous one, because the capabilities it so obviously holds is put to zero good use."
Tiresome instead of zany. Incoherent instead of riotous fun. Charmless instead of charming.
"The picture is hobbled by its shuffling pace, and by the ship's dim soundstage corridors and hazy colors (brick reds, teals and tans, a cold mortuary blue)."
A nasty-edgy drugs-and-sex Wilde-and-Rockwell comedy spoiled by a cloying Jane Fonda narration.
"If it were up to me this would be called The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window, Fell, and Was Never Heard From Again."
"Badly timed sight gags, weak one-liners, incessant music videos and sloppy sentiment are the order of the day. The stars throw themselves into it, but to no avail."
"Despite its title, Life Itself doesn't revel so much in the joys and travails of life as it does in the shameless emotional manipulation stemming from the ham-fisted tendencies of its own maker."
"feels a lot like a retread of Chinatown, only without the style and panache that Polanski brought to the table"
...the lowest-of-the-low in terms of direct-to-streaming horror flicks...
"Jim Hosking's An Evening with Beverly Luff Linn is terrible, but I bet the outtakes are incredible."
The concept is fun&#44; as we&#8217;ve seen the older characters become their younger selves&#44; and vice versa&#44; but not a 30-year-old pining to be an old lady&#46; There&#8217;s some inherent humor in that alone&#44; but nothing especially clever ever comes from it&#46;
"Bruce Willis, once the biggest movie star on the planet, has been made to surrender top-billing, and Shyamalan, once the path-breaking genius, is now offering meta-commentary on not only comic books and comic book culture, but also, strangely, his career."
"Pointless goof of a film, can't decide if it wants to be a superhero movie or a parody of one."
"Cloying fancy gives way to gross-out comedy, twisted social commentary, affecting pathos, and weirdly sexualized romance in this lurid live-action version of the classic children's book."
"As for the series maturing, well, Allegiant (a fancy word for 'loyal') is like man's allegiant best friend, stuck at the puppy stage--seeming so cute, but mostly just chasing its own tail, round and round, barking through the same old motions."
"It's very funny to be honest and most of the characters are perfectly cast, but Youth in Revolt is a movie in which literally nothing happens. At no point are any of the characters or plotlines developed and most of them are abandoned towards the end."
"Amy Adams adds plenty of welcome 'moxie' (and a tight pair of aviator's britches), but otherwise there's not much here besides noise, chaos and monkey-slapping."
The humor in The Favourite requires a level of estrangement and distance with history and the upper-class.
"It doesn't soft-pedal its material so much as it suffocates it with the meticulousness of its choices, with every aspect of its squalor noticeably art-directed."
"Inept as a monster movie, a romance and a cautionary tale, this disaster makes the case for letting this franchise go extinct."
The script is practically apologizing for its own existence.
"After seeing a very familiar routine performed, I can only assume that even Hart hasn't figured out how to move forward since he's still relying on tactics from his past."
There's one moment where Priscilla Shirer literally compliments her own prayer and I laughed out loud
"Part 3 makes your blood curdle, especially during the gory mall killer attacks. And it also scars your soul."
"I saw it. I didn't feel it. Look, I'm happy for Julia Roberts to travel the world. I just never felt connected to the journey of Liz."
Action-adventure tale has bloody violence and language.
This is a massive misfire that I unfortunately never connected with on an emotional level.
The movie's lofty intentions are hamstrung by having to coexist uneasily with a trio of stock characters.
"[Varda] seems less the confident, brilliant filmmaker history would make her out to be and more of a doddering old biddy with too much time on her hands."
"Brokeback Mountain is an epic love story about gay cowboys and that, in itself, is something. Otherwise, the film is not one to get particularly excited over."
"Death at a Funeral has almost no delightful machinations, no consistency of tone, no relatable characters, and worst of all, no funny jokes."
Consider it a bump in the road of Cage&#8217;s long-overdue return-to-the-mainstream resurgence&#46;
Thomas Carter's direction is flavorless.
It would take a very powerful Jedi mind trick to convince me this was any good.
This might have played better if the same riffs weren't already explored in Six Feet Under.
Everyone is now richer and better looking and it's a good deal cuter and more sentimental.
"Merchant's screen adaptation retains much of the novel's incident, but fumbles both the humor and moral ambivalence."
"The Place Beyond the Pines wants to be a deep-dish meditation on fathers, sons, and the consequences of the decisions we make. But it's a slow-burner that burns so slowly its wick completely fizzles out."
"This movie's ""believe in yourself"" message is borne out, in a perverse way, by the very fact that it even exists. And yet the whole thing remains nakedly idiotic."
It feels like a wasted effort that such a strong filmmaker would needlessly water down a serious topic for easier consumption like this.
"Nothing gets in the way of the rote staging, the ham-handed predictability, the feeling that you've been to this house, and yawned at these ghosts, once too often."
"Assayas' camerawork and use of technology is his downfall. Awkward mid-scene fade-outs feel clumsy and distracted, while some truly embarrassing CGI breaks the flow of the psychological drama."
"Forced, ungainly vehicle that stalls each time it threatens to actually start."
"While much of ""Awake"" simply doesn't work, there are just enough things on display that do to make you wish that someone had taken the time to elaborate on them"
"If there's anything worth mulling over about The Drowning, it's the way it proffers the East Coast couple as an inevitably miserable institution without really meaning to."
"The performances are transfixing throughout. But it does not satisfy emotionally, as the ending of The Sense of an Ending makes no sense. It's a (Non)Sense of an Ending."
"While the intentions are genuine and the performances excellent, the narrative's central failing is the stoic premise."
Idi's got da bling!
Lugubrious study of the perils of genetic engineering.
"This ""Brahms"" is a lullaby of horror, lulling you to sleep without any threat of nightmares."
"Familiar, routine story about not so interesting characters."
"Romania has delivered some of the most bracing filmmaking of the past 20 years... but ""Queen Marie"" shows that its cinematic output also extends to stiff, exposition-clotted biopics."
"The first third of The Switch, directed by Josh Gordon and Will Speck, is so bizarre that it leads you to wonder if, through some miraculous lack of oversight, the movie will blaze an unpredictable path. No such luck."
"Because of Winn-Dixie meets cute, but in the end it grates on the nerves."
James Cameron's waterlogged epic is as vainglorious and over-inflated as the ship it's named for.
"An aggressively awful opening 20 minutes gives way to over-the-top characterizations and an increasingly wan series of bits aping film moments we've all seen before, executed with more grace and charm."
"Most of the ""jokes,"" such as they were, have a mean-spirited edge and virtually none of them made me laugh."
"The movie is so uninvolving that it inspires renewed respect for Broken Arrow, which was equally stupid but excitingly filmed."
"Bleak, blue lighting and washed out colours emphasise the wintriness of the tale; but there isn't nearly enough dramatic conflict to sustain this to feature length."
The film's producers should give audiences a sew-on badge for surviving this.
"The tunes grow less exciting in tandem with the visuals, as ""Vivo"" runs out of steam as it trades Key West kitsch for swampland wildlife."
"Visual trickery cant buff up the dullness of the story at hand, with the predictable plot direction feeling particularly disappointing after the psychological complexity of Decker's previous works."
A little of it goes a long way. There's a reason the Stooges always made short films.
"Chock-full of visual tricks and treats, Hocus Pocus is actually just what its title implies -- cinematic chimera without much substance."
"You might label 'Trolls' as 'F.T.O.'-meaning 'for tots only,' like the Smurfs, though the studio is obviously hoping it can appeal beyond that demo."
"Burton really needed to lean his horror-comedy more toward horror. Instead, it's reminiscent at times of Love at First Bite and the feature film remakes of The Addams Family and The Brady Bunch."
"Continues the deliberate bad taste that is the franchise&#8217;s hallmark, with the usual hit-and-miss results&#8230; What&#8217;s missing is the heart that leavened the first two films."
When is a movie remake not a movie remake? When the filmmakers involved know what they've made is so wretched they don't dare admit it. The most oblivious MTV viewer won't miss the blatant plagiarism.
"... not a terrible film. It's brief, mostly good natured, and is populated by an entertaining cast that can bring interest to anything. But like a watery bowl of gruel, it's not much fun to choke down, nor is it particularly nourishing once you do."
A quick sweep-up is in order.
&apos;Old Man&apos; is hypnotic in the moment&#44; but deflating in the aftermath&#44; as the climax will most certainly invite discussion but little insight into the old man&#8217;s character beyond the most superficial observations&#46;
Only a slight cut above the run-of-the-mill American slasher picture.
"The plot is as negligible as ever, the sex-obsessed teenagers interchangeable and the grisly murders all twists on the old favourites."
Christopher Robin's attempt to bring Milne's classic stories into the adult world collapses in a resolution that even a child would recognize as insultingly simplistic.
"Two of our best actresses never develop the on-screen sparks together that we're expecting - that, indeed, would seem the entire point of making the movie in the first place."
"The film appears to have been devised to pander to the presumptions of Western, liberal viewers."
"So what else works, besides [Ewan] McGregor's performance? Darn little, even compared to The Phantom Menace."
"Tesla is simply too messy. There's plenty to say about human nature and about capitalism's claws and the correlation between past and present, but there's too much getting in the way of the story. It's pretty, but frustratingly hollow."
Patronizing and predictable.
The performers are more engaging than the screenplay in this thinly sketched romantic comedy.
"Bronson attempts to wring some unearned emotional redemption from her dimwitted characters, but the faux-Southern sincerity and June's incessant voice-over prove too annoying."
To the Wonder's scenario threatens to become a hermetic montage of Malick tropes. All divine energy without the gravitas of the dark matter.
"Ultimately the characters in Love the Coopers don't feel like a family. And yes, you could argue that's kind of the point. But they don't even feel like a dysfunctional family."
Love and Thunder is also surprising ugly&#58; just flat&#44; bad&#44; obvious CGI backgrounds and greenscreen work that makes the whole thing feel especially weightless&#46;
It is also typical in that it contains a lot of witless bathroom and ethnic humor...
"Ultimately, I can commend the parts heartily, but I'm not sure I'd recommend the whole."
"Prepare to be dazzled, we are told in the first few minutes, as fireworks are lit in eager anticipation. But the fireworks fizzle big time, as does this tedious, tired comedy that is short on appeal and laughs. Wacky and low-brow it is, but fun it ain't"
"A terminally muddled movie, uncertain as to whether it's promoting Neale, God, Mammon, Putnam Books or the capitalist exploitation of spiritual need."
"With a rather stilted and unfocused aesthetic, this tale of bias and bungling covers the same sad ground that documentary WEST OF MEMPHIS did so very well. Reese Witherspoon works hard but she and Colin Firth are wasted."
"As the title character, Michael Fassbender gets the SOB part down just fine, but there's little evidence of the personal magnetism that enabled Jobs to bend so many people to his will."
"Machete Kills is a film in which style sardonically routs substance, a cloying gag built around the iconic quality of Trejo's matchlessly craggy face, which resembles a plate of sundried corned beef."
The lurching rhythms of Ferdinand make a clean story feel ungainly and episodic ...
"Not completely horrific, although if I keep peeling back the layers, it might disappoint me more and more."
The urine-quaffing gags and hearty barfing asides are the lowbrow price extracted for...gestures towards semi-intelligence.
A stinker.
Never engages the viewer at a gut level.
High school horror flick more dreary than spooky.
"With the exception of Akerman's Annie, the characters are uniformly annoying, their stories insubstantial and the tone one of smug contentment. Production values are grade-A."
"Tside from a handful of stunning shots, the film often drags while its new ways of approaching the text fail to bring anything new to the table."
"a darkly humorous, but uneven cautionary tale that takes too many easy potshots at Bush-era religious conservatives"
...isn't interesting until it's almost over.
"Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan makes a valiant, if also, terribly forced and muddled effort to pull together two of his previous films and three character mythologies that span some 19 years."
"After a spate of manic superhero blockbusters that ricocheted from one digital spectacle to another, this one takes its time with character and plot but doesn’t develop either to any satisfying degree."
The second half has so much stuffed into into it that little makes an impact - including the flood. The narrative races choppily from one disconnected scene to another.
"One-dimensional characters try to stay ahead of the water rapidly filling a vast, unmapped cave in this survival drama produced by James Cameron."
Martin could have made a much more compelling film by focusing on just a few characters instead of trying to deconstruct an entire record label.
"I was sorry to see the zombie crows from the last film make only a token appearance here, but this was balanced by a return of the zombie Dobermans from the first movie."
A sleek psychological thriller outwitted by its own hyper craftsmanship.
Twelve and Holding is a tale of young friends who deal with death and family crises.
The problem is the movie's witless script ... can never decide whether it wants to be Grumpy Old Men III or GoodFellas II and it comes up short on both counts.
"Despite strong performances from Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn, The Interpreter unfortunately doesn't quite translate into a compelling sociopolitical thriller."
"It poorly realizes Thor, and hands us a ton of filler for what is a comeback movie with a paper thin premise."
"When the tour winds to a close, it's clear that you're supposed to feel the pangs of heartbreak as everyone heads off to brighter climes. Frankly, we were over the moon to be rid of these wet dullards."
"There are the makings of a poignant Harold and Maude-style drama here, but the movie is so amateurish and eager to be shocking, it just winds up feeling creepy."
The sequence of events that take place in this film just don't build up to anything that feels like it matters...
"In his arduous, sweaty attempt to be 'provocative,' what Renck does instead is make something transparent and fake."
"Teacher's Pet barrels along on a diverting enough sugar high, but in the hangover that follows you may wonder where the wonder was."
"Don't Look Up spends an inordinate amount of its time mocking a web phenomenon that's ubiquitous and requires very little effort to explain, virality."
"Inspiring film about small town villagers working towards a common artistic vision, but an unfortunately rushed climax and a missed opportunity to memorialize their performances."
"The deliberately lackadaisical, almost improvisational approach occasionally achieves striking moments, but mostly seems more flat and redundant."
"Stiles is a smart, beautiful, mature actress who has demonstrated a keen taste in projects in the past--note her much-admired rather minor role in the smart thriller The Bourne Identity. She's better than this."
"Not only is the screenplay far too long-winded, it is far too loose and lacking in dramatic tension until the very end."
Low emotional wattage in what ought to be a soaring romance.
"A visually stunning, but emotionally empty sci-fi classic."
Slow and plodding.
"When they decide to sic [those monsters] on downtown Los Angeles, the movie turns shockingly watchable. Until that sequence, there was no evidence that anybody involved with this laughable fantasy knew what he or she was doing."
Flimsy cinema. [Full review in Spanish]
"...director Baz Luhrmann wants to dazzle you with razzle, make you swoon over the gauzy glory of paperbook romance and hit you over the head with Fitzgerald's symbols if not his themes...It's a shame, really, as Leonardo DiCaprio is a great Gatsby."
"A box office phenomenon in France, this crowd-pleasing drama is based on a true story but sticks closely to the template for a Hollywood buddy movie."
could've been riveting stuff if only its subject was half as interesting as its approach
"Lame, tedious and decidedly NOT funny."
"Collett-Serra mechanically serves up stingy doses of action, humor and romance -- watching his film is like watching an alien try to create a summer blockbuster based on a checklist."
Wilson's phenomenal performance as a family man undone by sexual and financial temptation is more than this movie deserves.
The thrill is gone. The Marvel Universe shoots a blank. A tiny one.
"Derivativeness is not the problem -- all these stories stem from somewhere -- but the lack of imagination, coupled with the film's deadly earnest tone, is another matter entirely."
Tears is efficient and gets the job done -- but there's not much personality on display.
A cool sterility lingers beneath every cue meant to tug at our insides.
"A film so awful that if one were to put up a list of the great films celebrating motherhood, it would rank considerably lower than the Gus van Sant version of ""Psycho."""
"Sandler proves he can stretch beyond his more typical comedic range, but his role is contained in an ambitious but wobbly executed serio-comedy that feels more like a disjointed collection of ideas and moods than a wholly heartbreaking tale of friendship"
A Babel cast in a piece of free-associative gothic babble.
Human connections the actors well establish are more convincing than political messages. . .Much is head-scratching and moral debates are more rueful than thoughtfully deep.
"A visually interesting, well-acted and economical movie that ought to work yet doesn't gel as a complete experience."
Dobra vijest za gledatelje je da Seks i grad 2 nije loiji od prethodnog filma; loa vijest je da nije nimalo bolji
"2011's attempt is suitably monosyllabic and winningly grotesque, yet it just doesn't possess the stamina to carry out its quest without resorting to shallow Hollywood tricks to dazzle the crowds."
"Hats off, however, to the production team for the set designs and one very imaginative death-by-laser sequence. The rest is a derivative, tedious mess."
"Pleasant, it is not."
"The only thing to dislike about 'Love and Other Drugs' is how clearly, and desperately, it wants to be liked."
Zombie is a one-trick pony. I don't like the trick or the pony.
"The Legacy of a Whitetail Deer Hunter lacks true grit. Its designed to feel relatable, yet Brolins impassioned performance can only do so much to override the stock dialogue and the narratives lack of originality."
...Dickens as farce.
"Can't come up with a single reason to recommend this leaden excuse for an eco-thriller, which one Damian Lee claims to have written and directed."
"The stars look great, and the Mediterranean looks grand, but I spent more time looking at my watch."
While compelling in individual scenes&#44; especially as the boys navigate their increased anger at the world&#44; Beautiful Beings ultimately whiplashes between too many ideas and subplots to create a coherent thematic through line&#46;
"A mix of gung-ho action and heavy-handed patriotic pride, the point of South Korean war film Operation Chromite may be somewhat lost in translation for western audiences."
How much you enjoy this comedy will depend upon how gross you consider the idea of a married 50-year-old father having an affair with his best friend's 24-year-old daughter.
"Tim Meadows is very funny and entirely endearing, and it's too bad he got himself into this mess."
"It's clear that [Director] Jolie-Pitt is going to take her time to develop the plot. Also, that the story itself is small. [Full review in Spanish]"
"A movie is a movie, not an outlet for the most expensive arcade game ever made."
"It fails to evoke one laugh over the course of 90 minutes, revealing Woody Allen's sense of humor to be not merely ailing, but dead -- completely, utterly, forever dead."
It’s a tale that has been told hundreds of times and will be told again countless other times. And all of the past and future versions were or will be better than this.
"It's a reasonable film, unpretentious in its way."
The theatrical trailer for Joker -- tight&#44; controlled&#44; and intriguing -- suggested the best movie Martin Scorsese never made&#46; The actual movie is a shallow and sophomoric effort that isn&apos;t about a raging bull as much as it&apos;s merely raging bulls&#42;&#42;&#42;&#46;
An overly complicated film based on an otherwise simple cartoon.
"[Hillcoat is] an expert in creating and sustaining gut-twisting tension. Good qualities all, but used here in the service of a story that is truly unappetizing."
It mainly strikes fool's gold.
"""Low Down"" nicely evokes a smokey mood of '50s jazz and Hollywood noir and deserves points for its emotional straightforwardness, but its tired story and deliberate pace never really draw you in."
"It's distant, aloof and painfully self-aggrandizing, clearly overconfident in its ability to scare the audience."
"Do Revenge is surely the most shameless attempt yet to plug into nostalgia for Heathers, Cruel Intentions and other staples of the genre."
"If you believe that Trudi's silence about Rudi's illness is unethical, you'll want to throttle instead of console her."
"On the labored side of moribund, Come to Daddy feels like something we've seen before, considering its amalgamation of noir and genre tropes cobbled together."
"The Heart of Me would have been decent fare on television, but it lacks the grandeur one hopes for at the cinema."
There's good stuff around the edges of the film -- all that word play and all those visual gags demand that you pay attention lest you miss something even in the slow scenes But at the center no magic.
"The topic deserves a more substantial, more searching film than this jeu d'esprit - and Oldman and Banderas definitely deserve to be in that film."
"You can take the kids, you can take grandma; everyone will be ever so slightly entertained."
"With Dementia 13, Coppola glutted himself on exploitation."
A murky swamp of a movie.
Tough to watch without getting bored in the middle - it's a two-hour-plus film that easily could have shed half an hour - and not imagining how it could have been better.
"Thin on plot, not too long, no bad language and with enough silly jokes and visual gags to keep the average medium-age child amused... I just don't think it was intended as such."
A slight improvement upon its 2010 predecessor.
Do you like shoes? False sentimentality? Something that mistakes generalizations for insight? Then In Her Shoes is the film for you.
The apocalypse starts here.
"Lack of dramatic intensity is all the more surprising considering the emotional clout of helmer Marc Evans' two best movies, the chilling Resurrection Man and scarefest My Little Eye."
"Like the first movie, it has a few ideas -- a few too many, perhaps. But new director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is so determined to keep up the pace he explores them even less than Boyle did."
"For anyone who has ever said, ""Cate Blanchett is such a great actress that I would watch her read the phone book,"" Manifesto is here to hold you accountable."
"When a small delivery of casual swearing from Seymour Cassell earns your movie's biggest laugh, there's definitely a problem."
"Not much happens in Twist, apart from a dismal series of personal degradations, each more depressing than the last."
"I'm calling foul. Not sure if it's carrying or traveling, technical or flagrant, but Space Jam: A New Legacy isn't half the film that 1996's Space Jam was."
"A lethargic, very silly would-be thriller...featur[ing] scenes of abuse that are extremely nasty and protracted."
Tries to be more than a sitcom but keeps falling back on cheap laughs.
"entertaining, but not enough to make you want to root for the characters"
An incompetent comedy that must have either gone horribly wrong or simply started with a low bar.
"Ostensibly political stories rarely take partisan stands, and movies like the ponderously earnest ""Stillwater"" sink under the weight of their good intentions."
"A timely film that is disturbing but not necessarily fulfilling, as it never takes a stand and makes clear what is its thinking."
The movie doesn't even try for coherence. Each of its three distinct episodes is barely comprehensible in itself.
Nothing much here that you couldn't experience by watching 20 minutes of music television.
"Full Frontal is the kind of unplanned, meandering film that any aspiring filmmaker could make, but that only a big-name director could easily get distributed."
"There's something interesting here at the core of the conflict, but the story is offered so little room to breathe, coming across rushed and undercooked."
"This film's fanboy ejaculate loves you short time as it spews the buildup of what could be interpreted as a ""story"" and ultimately ends without one."
"If this had been made as a spoof of 1950s black and white sci-fi horror films, it might have been fun, what with the clash of zombie and sci-fi and mad scientist elements."
[A] shiny sitcom pilot that looks like something yanked from NBC's shelves circa 1989.
"Allen lingers over tired Hollywood jokes, dragging down the first half of the film and making the second half seem slower than it is."
Bones wanted to be stylish but ended up being a waste of time.
"""8"" a Dim Echo of ""11"""
"It's not bad, but as Scorsese, America's greatest living filmmaker and film history buff should know, even Hitchcock came up short on occasion."
One gigantic missed opportunity.
"There's not a whole lot to Cop Out besides watching Kevin Smith pretend, with a crudeness that is simply boring, that he's an action director making a comic thriller about cops versus a Mexican drug gang (yawn)."
"Pushes itself as strenuously as its young protagonist, but ultimately collapses in a welter of sentiment, cuteness and whimsy."
"Coward's storyline feels painfully dated, and the efforts by the new writers to goose things up with references to the pre-war equivalent of Viagra seem to go in the wrong direction entirely."
"The trouble is, to move forward you've got to learn from the past, and the dark roots of the Hemmingways feel neglected in Running From Crazy."
"Reminiscent of the films of Aki Kaurismaki and Jim Jarmusch, this wry, very slow German import by Michael Schorr has amusing moments but doesn't possess the droll absurdity needed to make it genuinely compelling."
"This has been a regular payday for Beckinsale and she certainly gives it her all, but you have to wonder why she bothers, certainly now that we know what she can do with more interesting material."
"The Silence doesn't manage to captivate its audience like it should, and it certainly doesn't bring anything new to its genre. Ultimately, the greatest thing it achieves is that it makes the viewer appreciate A Quiet Place even more."
It's little more than a revisionist version of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew without the clever wordplay.
"This is a fantasy with no poetry in it, which explains why barely a frame of it stuck with me after I left the theater."
"For moviegoers, the nerve gas might be no more irritating than the film's preposterous plotting."
"Slowly but surely, ""Flight"" degenerates from a tale of moral paradox and wounded romance into a mid-1990s after-school special about addiction and recovery."
"If you can accept Mads Mikkelsen as a depressed high school history teacher in the suburbs, maybe you will also believe that his beautiful doctor wife (Maria Bonnevie) would take him back after he makes drinking on the job the guiding principle..."
The adorable dog at the wedding did not say anything. That made him the most interesting guest at the reception.
"If Town & Country were a play, it would already have closed."
Satisfaction is fleeting.
"The picture is an exercise in exploitation joi de vivre, and your enjoyment of it will depend on your tolerance for shameless, reckless, unredemptive violence with relatively little artistic or spiritual value."
"An ugly, mean movie that represents the low point for Tarantino knockoffs -- and Tarantino actually produced it!"
"The ""ugly"" truth about this film is that it's all artifice and very little amusement."
Ultimately it all feels as hollow as its subject's ostentatiously avaricious lifestyle.
"Neeson's late-life rebirth as an action star may be drawing to a close with this limping, wheezing entry in the ""Taken"" franchise."
"It's shocking that for all of the advances in computer generated imagery, they still can't make a realistic looking werewolf. Lon Chaney's original 1941 werewolf far outshines the hairy beast here."
The performances deserve mentioning [because]...there is little else that proves worthwhile.
"Jennifer's Body tries hard to be cool, gross and nasty but feels forced and misses the mark."
This third Johnny English film comes seven years after the last one. It is clear that time was not spent honing the jokes.
"Occasionally funny, but all too often driven by the juvenile conviction that anything even remotely connected with homosexuality is riotously funny..."
"The racial message is crystal clear and the concept of turning the tables on oppression is rather interesting. Unfortunately, the movie is never focused or convincingly solid to realize the cynicism in its meandering material. At best, ""Burden"" is merely"
"It's not good, but it's enjoyable on a purely visceral level. It is an improvement over the first film in every possible factor."
There is no reason on earth 'The Collector' exists.
This film feels incredibly fake
Watching the movie is like listening to a friend explain a Wikipedia article that he's been obsessed with since he was 15.
I can&#8217;t deny that certain moving parts piqued my interest&#44; but all too often did they come to a halt&#44; with even such star wattage unable to blindingly distract from its messy assemblage&#46;
"While Farrell, Chastain, and Morton flex their theatrical muscles in entertaining ways, a 129 minute runtime proves to be bloated, exhausting, and unnecessarily drawn out."
"Intermezzo is the work of a film-maker gone down the rabbit hole, an ugly picture built on objectification and contempt for the audience."
"Never Go Back is deeply mediocre, as rote and indistinct as most of the action flicks that've marked Liam Neeson's late-career lull."
"Intentionally challenging, but the tastelessness is surely inadvertent."
"Max is cynical, joyless, and filled with surprising violence."
"May be humorless, paranoid nonsense, but its biggest failure is its inability to scare."
A beautifully made meandering mess of a film.
A superficial tween comedy that mocks celebutantes like the Olsen twins while simultaneously pushing stars Hilary and Haylie Duff as their replacements.
"A ploddingly pedestrian dramatization of Tupac Shakur's brief, tumultuous life."
"Although adeptly acted and featuring a good handling of tone by Berg, she occupies a position of too much observation and not enough visual expression, even if the film's core narrative is engaging."
It's as cold and dead as one of the many corpses produced by the defendants. ... Rarely have two hours felt so much like two years.
Kevin Bacon gives another stellar performance and there are some powerfully good action scenes but the structure of this Sentence doesn't feel like it was ever well-defined.
"The mayhem feels more familiar than fresh, despite the occasionally amusing sight gag or one-liner. It's time to put this series in the coffin."
It falls apart in the third act when plot decays into melodrama.
The Watcher will have written itself in your head by your third handful of popcorn.
"It's too long for kids, it's too slow for teens, it's too light for adults. It's too deep for those who don't like to think about their movies, it's too on-the-nose for those who do, and it's completely lacking in memorable action moments for those who ar"
The film is so emotionally obvious and awkwardly handled that it doesn't deserve much consideration as a political or historical statement ...
An uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening.
"Factotum is an existentialist indie film about the loneliness of the human condition, which is normally the cinematic equivalent of having a hole drilled in your head."
"Koel Purie has a nice blithe presence. Unfortunately, White Noise does not prove to be an adequate stage for her."
Sad
"The pieces are all there, but they never really snap into place."
"It may sound oxymoronic to criticize a movie like ""Leatherface"" for being depraved and mean-spirited, but this particular installment is ugly and distasteful in a way the previous seven entries were not."
Psssst...Don't tell anyone...This movie is pretty lame!
The unbearable and atrocious Midgets vs. Mascots can now be included in that select group of films that makes prostate exams seem appealing.
"When We First Met is a joyless, 90-minute slog that tries to split the difference between cutesy and crude, and subsequently accomplishes neither."
"Sloppy and inconsequential, like a keg party in a parentless home."
"[Dorff] spends most of the movie confusing tough-guy stoicism with simple inertness, despite the occasional Jack Bauer-style yell."
Not even Bill Murray could save Garfield.

Somewhere inside this lumberingly long fantasy-horror is a smart little black comedy trying to scuttle out.
"In spite of Caine’s charm and Plaza’s pluckiness, nothing in the movie feels genuine, and that’s a shame, because the conceit of having a politically incorrect dinosaur of a writer working with a young publisher could have been funny."
Only about as sexy and dangerous as an actress in a role that reminds at every turn of Elizabeth Berkley's flopping dolphin-gasm.
"This is where Hollywood is these days. Bereft of original ideas, it remakes better foreign films. Like most of these remakes, this doesn't come close to the original."
There are times where I couldn't help but wonder if the show would be better had all the actors just given into their inner drag queen.
"While I appreciate the gorgeous production design of The Photograph, because we don't know anything about these people, their wonderfully moneyed lives are more puzzling than comforting."
"The actor-musician, so magnetic in last year's EMMA., is convincing as a tortured glam rocker - just not the one who ever sang about Major Tom's interplanetary adventures."
Brady achieves the remarkable feat of squandering a topnotch foursome of actors ... by shoving them into every clichd white-trash situation imaginable.
It's unfortunate that the director who gave us one of the best horror films of the year with The Conjuring is the same guy delivering the terribly underwhelming Insidious Chapter 2 less than two months later.
They make Statham talk too much. And Lopez? Thanks for stripping.
"Two hours go by fast and don't leave you fuming for having wasted your time, rather feeling nothing at all - minus an overwhelming urge to slap that pipe from Gooding Jr.'s mouth."
"""Snowpiercer"" would clearly like to be the contemporary equivalent of Aldous Huxley's novel ""Brave New World,"" but it's closer to a better-directed version of Neill Blonkamp's sci-fi dud from last year, ""Elysium."""
"The actors do a decent job with the material , but the execution of the film was not presented well, plot was left in shambles and ""the noise"" is not understood in any way"
"All I know is that I can never get through Times of Harvey Milk without a handkerchief, while Van Sant's Milk left me forlornly dry-eyed."
"Redford himself seems to believe his own legend; he has joined his knuckle-headed, self-righteous progeny -- George Clooney, Sean Penn and Matt Damon -- by directing a film that is as dull as it is politically hip."
Reunion plays like some dizzy-minded daytime drama that's complete with transparent pesky personalities wrapped up in a numb sermonizing of faith and fruitless frolic.

It aims to play fast and loose with the splatter formula.
"The musical choices are so on-the-nose as to make you do double takes. How do we know that Micky has his heart back in the fight game and is ready to commit fully? Why, we hear Aerosmith's Back in the Saddle."
"Begins as a story that has intriguing and seriously complex moral and ethical implications before giving way to what is a fairly by-the-numbers, beat-the-clock serial-killer thriller."
This filmmaker's madness could use just a little more method.
Besides the cloying plot and melodramatic dialogue -- a lot of which is so obvious that audiences shout it out before the actors mouth the words -- the acting is wretched.
"The spectacle flies high, but the script sinks fast. Still, it's better than Pearl Harbor. [Full review in Spanish]"
Honest Thief has insincere characters&#44; a mundane plot&#44; and is a fairly bland thriller by any standard&#46;
"With animated movies coming out every other week or so, mediocrity is becoming a rule. Open Season loses more points than most films because of its similarities to Over the Hedge, one of the few kids films that did it right this year."
"these creatures attack strictly one at a time, so that Anacondas misses every opportunity to live up to its titular promise."
"In many ways, Daredevil is a bubbling pot of clichs."
"Unlike the bear of very little brain, this is a film pulled in different directions with entirely too many thoughts in its head."
Nothing special to show at the end for this existential trip to nowhere.
"... I liked this premise in movies like Dave, or the Eddie Murphy movie The Distinguished Gentleman, where the unknown or the underdog becomes the candidate or even the president, but this is so poorly done."
"For all its flaws, it is far from the worst entry in the MCU, but it is, perhaps, the first of Marvel's films to be less than the sum of its parts."

"I hate to say this, but Cars 2 is the first Pixar movie that feels dead inside."
"This is the kind of movie I would give my life for, if my life spared the world from seeing garbage like this."
"What's missing, besides narrative drive, is the existential angst at the anime's heart: the titular ghost in the shell is the soul, the humanity, resident in the surviving human brain planted in an electric Barbie Doll."
... settles in a field where nothing is really serious or has serious consequences. [Full review in Spanish]
"Alternately precious and vapid, the movie attempts to wrest metaphors from a jar of house keys, and eternal verities from pastry. Slice the pie how you will, it's still half-baked."
Something tells me the only good deduction likely to come from this Sherlock Holmes is a tax deduction for Warner Bros.
There are times when 2012 feels as if it is not going to end until 2012...
"Just another farfetched potboiler, making less and less sense as it hits increasingly predictable plot twists."
"The dialogue was standard and dull, the acting was there but not fascinating, and the mystery of the killer wasn't as cool as it could have been."
"A deeply lazy and sentimental raunch comedy from director Judd Apatow and writer-star Amy Schumer. Basically, a marshmallow covered with bodily fluids."
"In its noisy, pointless way, Street Fighter does come close to the frenetic meandering of a video game scenario -- which is precisely the problem."

"Born out of a desire to explain the seemingly inexplicable, the Ouija board remains enigmatic."
[T]he film's overabundance of preposterous pop-corny-ness and simultaneous and surprising naivete defang it.
"A deeply unpleasant micro-budget indie that has no clue how to extrapolate a single location into an entire feature, Free Samples is an ugly bit of work."
An oddly juiceless older woman-younger man romance.
"At least the funny stuff keeps you laughing once in a while, but the romantic portion feels forced and becomes quite boring"
A fairly standard-issue teen romantic comedy.
A film with a story that little kids will find to be too obscure and older viewers will find too juvenile and which is told with a visual style that viewers all ages will find drab and uninteresting.
The socio-economic moral is ladled on like great big dollops of paella.
And that's it: The bad guy with the sideburns tortures them and lets them have it one at a time.
While Luck is in no way a disaster&#44; the film has nearly no truly notable elements either&#46; The performances are strong&#44; but their characters feel forgettable and the story they are stuck in is completely dull&#46;
Interior. Leather Bar ultimately rings hollow in its diatribe and agenda because its chief instigator refuses to open up.
"We've heard those trumpet riffs before; we watched Rocky do push-ups to them. And that's all ""The Cutting Edge"" is -- ""Rocky"" on skates."
"Halloween Kills is an ugly, messy film. It's a little depressing to learn that yet another sequel is supposedly in the works."
Pretension and poor writing dressed up as art-house cinema.
"The story would qualify as your basic spy opera... if there was any feeling to it, but the film has no more engagement than a big-screen video game"
What's lacking is a story to keep up the interest between incidents.
Smallfoot really flounders with its obligatory message-mongering.
Warren Beatty's portrayal of Howard Hughes has the overly polished feel of an anecdote that's been told too often.
"Amateurish, low-budget ghost tale; some smoking."
Typical Sandler comedy overflows with stereotypes.
"Have a Nice Day has fair comparisons to Quentin Tarantino, specifically his bank heist debut masterpiece Reservoir Dogs and is broken up into chapters, but it lacks interesting dialogue, memorable characters, and an engaging narrative"

It illustrates why them French went and invented the word 'merde.'
"If you're looking to kill a couple of hours, there are worse fates awaiting you out there."
"If there's a silver-lining to any of this, maybe the film could become a bestselling educational DVD, under the title, 'Mistakes to Avoid While Making a Sequel.'"
"The multi-decade-spanning drama ""The Affair"" raises more questions than it answers: Questions such as ""Who?"" ""Which?"" ""What?"" ""Where?"" and, mostly, ""Why?"""
The idea that revenge is a prerequisite for transcendence is an odd underpinning for a modern blockbuster. What would Nelson Mandela have made of that I wonder? If only we could ask him.
"If there was a device that could measure the impact of jokes falling flat, this film would be an ideal test subject."
"Colin Higgins, who also directs, manages the farce with clumsy, uninventive energy.  "
"I get that these movies are not primarily targeted at English-speaking audiences, but they've got a writer (Chris Morgan, who's done a half-dozen of these) on payroll. He could try writing a little. It would pass the time."
An annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere.
Jewison is not sure if he wants to make a chase or message film.
Hey...please don't do anything like this to us again. Thank you.
Swinton's presence proves as strange as the rest of this sometimes-stimulating but often-ludicrous endeavor.
There's more scatological action in 8 Crazy Nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career.
"A clumsy, implausible terrorist-action-drama, Olympus Has Fallen falls in a period between prime movie-going seasons and it shows."
There is literally no tension in this movie. The failure falls squarely on both Wright and Letts.
"For all Brougher's smart choices, her film is frequently compromised by too much tidiness."
"The look is gorgeous, of course, but seldom has so much aestheticization served so much heartlessness."
"Though it's mostly entertaining (if overlong), there is a sense that the whole thing has become somewhat rote."
"It's ugly in the way that only films driven by fanatical vision, unfettered by checks, and galvanized by awards and money can be ugly"
Motherhood gives upper-middle-class whining a bad name.
"The movie is 87 minutes, but it feels long... Most of this is just visual weirdness."
Good performances and convincing setting; but could have used a spark to light things up
"On ice, the movie is often fairly funny. Off it, the garish outfits, the genitalia jokes, the beer-slob gags about gays, the women as cheap laughs, even the cute guest cameos start to shiver and melt."
"The high-altitude combat is thrilling, and aviation buffs will thrill to all the pretty biplanes sailing through the clouds. But the characters are corny and the situations are clichéd."
"Ticket to Paradise may well do great business to those looking for some escapist fun, and that’s entirely understandable. But I found the wacky double-act of George and Julia slightly hard work."
"By the end, the whole endeavor wears out its welcome and the empty calories become more obnoxious than just apparent and benign."
Shameless anti-HMO propaganda...Only Washington's performance salvages a hint of entertainment value.
"Never reaches a fraction of the impact of Friedkin's The Exorcist, but the director narrates with an overly straight face that calls to mind Robert Stack's no-nonsense voiceovers on Unsolved Mysteries."
"comes off like a rejected ABC Afterschool Special, freshened up by the dunce of a Screenwriting 101 class. ...provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns."
"An exquisitely filmed piece of urban impressionism that, unfortunately, leaves one feeling that a sleek gadget has been needlessly purchased."
"What a curious arc this movie has described: starting in terror, and ending up on the very brink of kitsch."
"This new update shares commonality with the franchise in name only, opting instead to create a tonally-confused road trip into the unpredictably bizarre."
As the plot develops it does lose momentum a bit and at times verges on cliche.
"I think it's a very interesting story, a slightly frustrating one but very vibrant use of the locations."
Goes in search of brilliance without any shame and therefore falls into a dazzling immodesty. [Full review in Spanish]
A grandly mediocre accomplishment.
"Rightfully angry, but too simplistic, annoying and tedious."
Such an awful chapter of history doesn't need to be packaged as a grand romance to evoke an emotional reaction.
"The film is calm and quiet, but without the intensity (and element of protest) at its core that Hou's films once possessed."
"Every time the story shows some glimmer of originality, it immediately retreats back to formula."
what was fresh in the original is stale in the sequel
"Despite its manifest improvements, there is something so sour and unpleasant about the new film that it left me almost nostalgic for the innocent idiocies of its predecessor."
"Romantic comedy hits a new low, and my stomach bile hits a new high."
"Falls into the category of works that should not have been remade - or, at least, it should not have bothered to use the original screenplay as a starting place."
"So aware of genre conventions, manipulations, and symbolism that it functions more like an intellectualized primer than an actual terrifying experience."
"Abandon's tsunami of conflicting tones -- it's quirky but humourless, studied but predictable -- frequently make it feel much stronger than it actually is."
These sequels are wet noodles.
A decently executed but generic thriller ... most notable for advancing the dubious theory that the best way to help a child who is being bullied is to traumatize the heck out of him.
"Lucio Fulci's mid-period The Black Cat just pilfer's Poe's original for exploitational imagery, essentially ditching the self sabotaging inner turmoil for a superfluous supernatural yarn stuffed with non sequiturs."
"Trust me, this movie doesn't deliver on any level, high or low."
The story quickly slips into Austen formula.
Plays like a second-rate version of Rob Reiner's multiple Oscar nominee A Few Good Men!
The Unborn is like a scary movie sentence without the necessary linking verbs. It's all genre gears and no motivational motor.
"Blood, gore and not much more"
"Overall I felt disappointed in the film, I wanted to more engaged then I was."
"It's certainly good to see that Disney didn't give us just another song-and-dance romp, but in their attempt to be serious, they forgot to keep us entertained as well."
"It doesn't do its inspirations justice, but Pet Sematary at least makes the story its own in a world full of reboots and remakes."
Best to leave this package unopened on the stoop.
"Yes, Keke Palmer looks ""cool"", exacting vengeance in a style that would make Cleopatra Jones proud, but none of it feels earned."
"Fails in making this character understandable, in getting under her skin, in exploring motivation...Well before the end, the film grows as dull as its characters, about whose fate it is hard to care."
"The biggest problem with Man of the Year is that, much like American Dreamz, which came out earlier this year, it simply doesn't seem to know what genre it aspires to be."
"Unfortunately, John Kani (Rafiki) and Alfre Woodard (Simba’s mother Sarabi) are wasted in their underwritten and one-note roles, as is Beyoncé."
"""Adult World"" is a coming-of-age story in which the starting age seems to be approximately 9. As a result, it just doesn't work."
By this point... I think I've had enough of The Lego Movies. These things can only go so far and I think they may have exceeded their natural life span.
"Even the top ensemble case of Knockaround Guys, headed by the ever-remarkable John Malkovich and charismatic Vin Diesel, can't jump the brick wall that the script hits in the last 20 minutes."
"As Alig, Culkin makes a complete embarrassment of himself, but the true horror of his performance is felt most whenever he shares screen time with the incredible Seth Green."
"A Yule-themed comedy horror that is neither funny, nor particularly horrifying, Better Watch Out feels like a malicious spin on Home Alone."
"There's an attractive air of menace hanging over the proceedings, but otherwise the movie feels stagey and stilted."
"The idea that phone sex workers can turn out to be quite different than their disembodied voices imply might be worth exploring by a more earnest, diligent and engaged intelligence than whatever drove this project."
"By Jig's end, director Sue Bourne seems to have lost interest in all but two of her young subjects. In fairness, that's two more than I managed."
"Randolph's vendetta also turns out the be the death of Smoochy, punctuated by Williams' incessant screeching and Wily E. Coyote-esque antics."
"To the list of insults, real and imaginary, committed by the Great Satan against the Arab world, add 'Sex and the City 2,' in which Carrie Bradshaw and friends bring their name-brand materialism, exhibitionist licentiousness and Western bunk to Abu Dhabi."
"Hillbilly Elegy is exactly the kind of movie that makes ""Oscar bait"" the target of ridicule."
"Even if they are middle-aged, Smith and Lawrence still fly through the air, in slow motion, shooting two guns at once, and drive a Porsche 911 recklessly through the ""this time, it's personal"" plot of the film."
"a flat, derivative psycho-thriller that suffers badly from having no chemistry between its two leads"
"Lacks originality, inspiration and invention."
"Putting its emphasis on broad comedy at the expense of ingenious plotting and technical wizardry, it has virtually none of the mythic or cosmic sensibility that marked its predecessors."
Avoid like the plague.
Plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial.
"The sloppy, tone-deaf script rushes things out when not repeatedly jumping back and forth in time... a torturing experience."
Ascher proudly entertains the half-baked musings of the same sorts of dudes who worship Elon Musk tweets. Breathtakingly bad.
"Skyline might be a midnight B-movie, but it's also hopelessly inept and a grievous waste of time and talent with no ending whatsoever."
"By the time kids are old enough for some of the film's content, I'm not so sure they'll care about the lackluster Igor."
Indifferently acted and insufficiently frightening.
"The romance develops so suddenly (note the three-day weekend of the title) that we never quite believe it, and several murky flashbacks suggest a twist that never satisfactorily arrives."
"The little beasties in the new film are computer-generated, reasonably realistic (way ahead of Garfield) and cute. It's not their fault the humans, especially Jason Lee's Dave Seville, are excruciatingly boring."
Even 2003 Robin Williams would have thunked this script in the fireplace by page 50.
"Of the 350 different species of shark, 46 of them are swimming freely through this Louisiana lake, which I suppose makes sense, since it's made up of salt water. Uh-huh."
"Minus the corn, it's almost good."
Mortensen attempts to channel the Ghost of Clint Eastwood Westerns Past.
"Josh becomes increasingly distraught and depressed, but not nearly as much as the poor people watching the movie."
"It might have been a premise for an effective romantic comedy that pointed up the plight of undocumented immigrants, but Morris and his co-writers aren't up to the task."
Remember when Martin Short was funny?
Can't decide whether it's high stakes or high school.
"Aside from a few changes, The Hitcher '07 is pretty much the same film as the original, just not done as well."
The fatal flaw of The Overnight is that neither the screenplay nor the directors &#46;&#46;&#46; bother to establish the foundational mechanics of what&apos;s even happening&#46;
"It's Tyler Perry's aesthetic in a nutshell: strong, suffering female protagonists, no-good men, clear-cut ethical quandaries, schizophrenic tonal shifts handled as gracefully as bumper-car collisions, and a complete absence of moral ambiguity."
"Lots of familiar faces are brought in to liven things up. But it's all rather diluted, as though the ice has melted in the dry martini."
"An experimental, transgressive work that pretty much fails on every level."
There's a drab air to this low-budget film ... which even Sam Keeley's presence and Tom Vaughan-Lawlor's menace can't totally re-animate.
"A standard story delivered well with not many stylistic discretions, which gives it a timeless quality."
"It's the perfect showcase of 'an idea' and not a film. While there are some laughs, it eventually feels like a waste or time."
"As ""Zero to Hero"" comedies go, this is one of the strangest -- and one of the most irresponsible."
A spirited spoof on high school life.
Not one of them manages a convincing argument as to why this film was made.
"At the end of the film, I felt as if ""Lady of the Lake"" would better fulfill its purpose as a documentary rather than a docudrama."
"Actually, instead of Captain America: Civil War, a more appropriate title might be Captain America: Cap and Iron Man Get Their Iddy-Biddy Feewings Hurt."
"Despite the interesting and pertinent subject matter, Crow's film feels shapeless and unfocused."
Smut.
Can audiences who've seen the Harold & Kumar films and watched Method Man and Redman smoke John Quincy Adams' bones in How High settle for so little?
How I Fell in Love with a Gangster is too overwrought with style and uneven in its storytelling to be taken seriously&#46;
Somewhat pretentious and entirely too slow and self-conscious to be of more than passing interest 
"It's not easy to make a thriller that's both incredibly convoluted and intensely boring, but director E. Elias Merhige scores on both counts with this lame excuse for a spooky crime story."
"Forget the rocky character development. Give me a fat guy falling down, and I'll start to laugh."
Larraín wraps his story of revolutionary poet Pablo Neruda within a fictional narrative; the approach is sadly unsuccessful.
"The special effects are better and the dialogue slightly more humorous than in the first movie, but the anti-Arab subtext is repugnant."
... a minor entry in the Kiss the Girls/Along Came a Spider line ... Seyfried isn't the least bit convincing in a role that called for hysteria cut with outrage. She manages little-girl peevishness.
That Spielberg refuses to go after bigger game keeps the film a banal exercise in sentimentality.
"Palmer is a sneaky kind of vanity project... It works to shrink and reshape Timberlake into a serious actor with a political heart, imbued with a mission toward social justice."
Not even the soundtrack can save this Crowe effort.
"If you want a gore fix, this is it. If you're looking for a film with purpose, better wait until the bill changes."
Those images lack emotional impact when they're used to deck out a plot of dinner-theater flimsiness.
The characters are basically delivery systems for the film&apos;s metaphors&#44; and the actors can&apos;t access much beyond the basics -- fear&#44; love -- in the moment&#46;
"These early fights, as goofy and inventive as they are, build up our goodwill toward Jaa, [but] the limb-breaking, tendon-severing finale dispels it."
Nostalgia only gets you so far&#44; and beleaguered director Colin Trevorrow comes close to ruining a legacy&#46;
"The film is more gimmickry than poetry. The effects are state-of-the-art, but the effect is remarkably earthbound."
"...its slack pace, aided by Allen's insistence on slow, improvisational acting styles, plus its soft center turn the film into an Allen also-ran."
"Con una historia mala, actuaciones simplonas y direccin mediocre, Tomb Raider es otro de los grandes fracasos del ao"
The drama here is rather trite and never adds up to anything you can put your finger on.
"It's not a bad idea for a movie, but what we get is undercooked, with poor logic and even poorer pacing conspiring to prevent any much-needed tension to build."
"I wish the script/the way the film was put together, had complimented and partnered with Charlie Saroff's elegant cinematography and the rest of the film's technical beauty, but it unfortunately got lost and fell flat within its own demented obscurity."
"Singleton seems to struggle to keep it under control, finally giving up in the end and letting a dopey Hollywood finale overrun the film."
Too flatly refined to evoke the turbulent existence it examines.
The Spirit is the very definition of style over substance.
"Rather than acting as social commentary, the remake merely exploits the overarching theme of crime and punishment to unleash more violence and death."
"There is nothing startlingly new in Resident Evil: Apocalpyse, but it is delivered with some panache and humor."
"When the last bullet hits, it's still the same old runaround, only with several new faces striking poses and emptying their weapons into one another."
"If I could explain [Breaking Dawn] in a way that would make it less weird, I would, but there is no amount of extra explanation that achieves that goal."
"I had wanted to like HAPPY FEET more -- I went in expecting a more lighthearted piece. While Miller is to be commended for adding layers to the story, I do feel it went on way too long and that its points were hammered home. And I'm well aware I will be"
"Comes at politics from a rather odd angle, trying to make earnest points about politics while following around the ridiculous Matt Gaetz."
"THE CAPTIVE is a disaster, but I must admit that it's at least entertaining in a ""wow, I can't believe this exists"" kind of way"
"Spoiler alert: babies are similar around the world. That's it. While that may be just barely enough to hold together a TV special, it's not nearly enough for a feature documentary."
"A Good Day to Die Hard and Max Payne director John Moore has updated the notorious 2006 flop Firewall for the smartphone era with I.T. , and it's every bit as unpleasant as A Good Day to Die Hard and Max Payne."
Not at all funny David Spade movie.
"... Barry Levinson's bizarre, blundering, pointless misreading of Philip Roth's penultimate novel."
"The movie might suffice on late-night cable, but it is hardly worth big-screen prices."
Nick Frost shakes his funky stuff in this likeable if unadventurous British romantic comedy.
"Blatantly crass, crude and raunchy, it's only occasionally amusing, prompting the question: Why bother?"
Murder on the Orient Express makes for some great set pieces...but the whodunnit mystery doesn't really need another adaptation.
"Over-the-top imagery, music, and rapid-fire editing are the culprits that stigmatize the story."
It's all rather mannered and the final denouement is disappointingly banal.
"Leave it to the Material Girl to confound all knife-sharpened expectations, even in mediocrity."
The chase scenes -- and there are many -- are well shot with deft comic timing. The rest you can see coming all the way from uptown.
"Kebbell portrays Doom not as a dictator with supreme technical and sorcerous powers, but a video game playing beardo with daddy issues (to be fair, they all have daddy issues)."
Children would learn more about natural processes from five minutes of any David Attenborough film than they could from all of FernGully.
"Even with an amusing soundtrack and some exciting action scenes, it plays more like an extended music video than an engrossing film with a narrative.

"Instead of the promised lighthearted tone of the TV series, the big screen update avails itself of its PG-13 liberties and comes stuffed with a barnful of profanity and enough marijuana references to satisfy even the most stoned out Cheech and Chong fan."
Unquestionably the worst movie of Wim Wenders' career and indeed one of the worst movies ever made...
Can one smell bull**** in space?
Proof that Cage will sign up to anything that involves a mad hair weave and a motorbike.
"Ultimately, the material starts to feel thin, with Guzmán attempting to cover everything in less than 90 minutes."
"It's funny, but strained. Now may be a good time to stick a fork in it."
"As we follow their adventures, it's impossible to ignore how poorly women come off in this story, alternatively as nags, cheats, liars and cloying opportunists."
"This take on undersea adventure movies, though studded with amusing bits, feels smug and self-satisfied, as if the quirkiness no longer is merely a by-product of the way Anderson views the world."
"As the movie goes along, a dullness begins to creep in. This is a conventional and unimpressive effort by Van Sant."
Would-be thriller about snuff films is a snooze.
"Vince Vaughn would make an excellent Willy Loman in a revival of Death of a Salesman. Here, he has the presence, charm, desperation and sense of yearning that characterise Arthur Miller's doomed anti-hero. Unfortunately, this is a very goofy comedy."
Simply animating things that were already animated using a different animation technique is Apple-level fanbase abuse.
The Fear Street trilogy comes to a merciful close with this inert and hopelessly uninvolving entry&#46;&#46;&#46;
"Despite the potential for some fun retaliatory reciprocation between the two main characters, the film comes off as rather flat and uninspired, with only a few, occasional laughs breaking up what's otherwise an unimaginative and monotonous exercise."
Relentessly twee and monumentally muddled.
"This film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers. For the rest of us, sitting through Dahmer's two hours amounts to little more than punishment."
"An abomination, and the favorite movie of the year for people who like to say, ""But what about black-on-black crime in Chicago?"""
The real pity is that the film could have made its points without being so insufferably preachy and ponderous.
Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer strives to capture the insouciance of Megan McDonald's popular book series but overshoots its comedic potential.
A movie that's likely to appeal only to the most susceptible and uncritical romantics.
"It's certainly a film that's cruel to disagree with, but for all the goodwill and positivity it brings, there's a hollow, gimmicky quality left behind that doesn't sit well when the picture starts to take matters seriously."
"It's broad, naughty, and irresponsible, but never inspired, carefully coloring inside the lines, refusing the challenge of barnstorming blackout entertainment."
"Ambiguous to a fault, it's at least unique and challenging, and in a season largely dominated by imbecilic efforts like Need for Speed and Pompeii -- films that go out of their way to kill precious brain cells -- that certainly counts for something."
Exceptionally small and simple - and uncommonly un-cinematic.
"There’s an interesting concept in Brett Neveu’s script, but it would have likely worked better as a longer short than a feature."
"This update of The Taming of the Shrew has appealing stars in Smith and Union, but their charm is too fragile to survive the dopey script."
Woefully sentimental and maudlin.
Save yourself the horror of watching a man&#8217;s work dry up and watch some of his more admired work instead&#46;
Del Toro seems to use this movie as batting practice for The Hobbit.
A mess of a movie.
"This is a well-meant story of someone pulling himself up by his bootstraps, with some help from his grandma. But it feels contrived and self-conscious."
"August Diehl excels in the eponymous lead role, as he so often does, complete with an endearing glint in his eyes, as somebody you feel gets a real kick of out a debate, as if waiting, fervently, for somebody to have the courage to disagree with him."
Wanders from joke to joke with not enough narrative -- or blood -- to make it all stick together.
Holy Rollers is based on true events but it lacks any spark of originality.
"[It's] a blood-soaked, macabre and initially fascinating film. One where style made sure substance never got the invite to attend, then takes over the whole mad -- and maddeningly slow -- shebang."
It's an excruciating experience...
"Set to the operatic background score of an Old Spice commercial, all the emotional manipulation gets in the way of inspiration."
It's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like Punch-Drunk Love.
"Where is the humor, the propulsion, the story sense of del Toro's best work?"
The movie can't overcome characterizations that are as spare as the landscapes and a Searchers- like story line that just isn't interesting enough to sustain interest over the course of 135 minutes.
Schlndorff's treatment of this material is horribly flawed because he's too interested in making the audience feel comfortable before he starts damning everything.
8 Mile isn't about race or hip-hop as much as it is about making a valuable commodity more palatable to a mainstream audience.
Battling in-laws face off in formulaic comedy.
"the arresting start and reality-challenging end are left in search of their middle, a sort of narrative black hole filled with much aimless scurrying about, Scooby Doo-style sleuthing & snot-nosed weeping into the lens (à la Blair Witch Project)."
"Uzo Aduba gives a fine performance in the otherwise flat ""Miss Virginia,"" playing real-life education advocate Virginia Walden Ford."
Disappointingly strip-mines the very fatigued comic hit-man genre to diminishing returns.
Needed more work on its vim and vigor.
"If you like your films light and bright, without pause for any of the authentically raw emotions that would naturally be associated with any one of these story lines, then go on, take your mum and go see Mother's Day."
Playmobil lacks plenty of charm. [Full Review in Spanish]
"While there's time for action and chaos, the detective work is sloppy, resulting in plenty of collateral damage and destruction; it's all brawn and no brains."
Mel Gibson's insanity finally gets the public spotlight it truly deserves.
Brad Pitt plays a watered-down version of his 'Inglourious Basterds' character in this disappointingly bland look at a World War II tank crew.
"If I were to attend to a night school such as the one portrayed in this film, I would be down on my knees, pleading until my throat bleeds to be expelled from the class, because Night School is one of the most insufferable comedies of the year."
A nightmare of blandness.
"That's a fairly delicious scenario, but even so, the film never really catches fire"
"Even the most forgiving fans of supernatural horror will balk at Mirrors' cookie-cutter characterizations, predictable shocks, and ridiculous, punishing plot."
"It's ponderous and endless, and raised only two question in my mind: How many times can Kevin Spacey rehash the same performance? And is death the ultimate deadpan?"
"Essentially an autobiographical coming-of-age movie, one that includes a good many affecting moments but, in the last analysis, doesn't manage to bring them together into a satisfying whole."
"The noble intention to make us dwell on our culture, and perhaps shame its more voyeuristic members, quickly devolves into a cavalcade of tedium."
"[T]his can't be called naturalism ... Vera has to represent the bad medicine that fills the gap for low-income women, the bad medicine that results inevitably from bad law."
Childish.
Old School is testament that even the greatest improvisers in the world should be avoiding directors such as Todd Phillips like the clap.
Neither the former sitcom star nor the washboard-abed Scotsman is served well here.
There are stray sparks of satiric wildness shooting out from this preachy teen message movie.
A Tarantino-esque mishmash of tough crime cliches spit out in Aussie accents.
"Do we really need another version of Edgar Rice Burroughs' most ripping yarn? Not on the basis of this Tarzan, a bland motion capture animated feature."
"There's a moment in the third act when the emotional tangles feel dangerous and exciting... But the rest of the film is not as good as these brief few minutes, and cruises in a lower gear"
You will leave the cinema utterly disenchanted.
"Except for the scintillating first half hour on the plane, Blake Edwards told the story of an alcoholic much better in 1962's 'Days of Wine and Roses' with a more realistic, non-Hollywood Ending."
Lacking compelling reasons to stick around&#44; the film offers a reminder of why working from home may be the solution rather than sticking around for a second view of this disappointing slog&#46;&#10;&#10;
This film just wades into a murky lake of self-consciousness and sinks inexorably to the bottom.
"The real shame is that Jackson and Tommila have a prickly chemistry together, and it would have been special had it not been in a movie that sucked quite as hard."
"Between 'Hook,' the faithful 2003 adaptation and the 1953 classic, there's not a lot of fertile ground for new Pan stories and this prequel fails to validate its existence."
"The action sequences are forgettable, a blur of CGI punches and jumping sequences in which Morbius leaves a trail of streamy ribbons in his wake that are supposed to show his flight but instead look like the remnants of a retired cheerleaders pom-pom."
Man on the Moon captures the mood of Kaufman's stand-up act while paying loving tribute to the late comic.
"Keeping the Faith struggles hard to be a modern romantic comedy about commitment and, well, faith, but it doesn't quite make the grade."
It's crap on a leash--far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of Joe Dante's similarly styled Gremlins.
"Occasionally thrilling, but frequently meandering."
"To be honest, Branagh's stately direction means the mystery itself is a bit of a plod. Even if you don't already know whodunit."
"The elements never quite come together, and the main characters never quite spring to life."
"To really get under your skin, a bad-seed horror movie needs a demon child whose dastardliness sneaks up on you. There's nothing too subtle, however, about Esther."
"If you're presold on it, you're likely to forgive the film's flaws -- or at least try to. If not, you'll rarely have been so glad to see the ending credits finally start."
"It's hard to tell if it's Cruise or the dragging weight of the movie, but he's almost totally devoid of the star power that makes the ""Mission: Impossible"" movies compulsively watchable."
"Two minutes 48 seconds of cuts by the BBFC have taken the edge off some unnecessary sadism, but the brush-written credits remain the highlight."
A self-consciously crazy action romp which overdoses on cartoonish violence and non-PC comedy.
"Filmed mostly in winter, in browns, grays and soiled whites, Sleepwalking sustains a mood of unrelenting bleakness, wearing its aesthetic of desolation like a badge of integrity."
"Without the relatively tight focus of Scream movies to draw upon, Scary Movie 2 is scattered and more than a little starved for inspiration."
"This glamorous, sadistic fabrication appears one long procession of derivative ideas."
"It's like a sober, centrist, irrelevant op-ed column, but with bad words and belly laughs."
So-so romantic comedy sunk by the cast
Yet another case of Hollywood execs trying way too hard to give the audience what they think it wants.
"If there's a small saving grace to this crude thriller, it is the work of Montreal-born director Christian Duguay, who shows flashes of real flare."
"The cast is great; the book was great; so why is this movie so wrong, Mr. Wright?"
"When dealing with larger-than-life personalities, world conflicts, and a future of unspeakable misery, 90 minutes and some sugared patter just doesn't satisfy."
"Insidious 2 really wants you to be happy, but it's far too much of an uneven mess to do it very well."
"We know that Sabian will do the right thing and help Danny in the end, but when the mystery is unraveled and the frame-up is revealed, I, personally, had no idea what anyone was talking about."
"The Hollywood comedy Tropic Thunder comes at us like a mad army cresting a hill, intent on audience massacre. My advice: shoot first and don't wait for the whites of their eyes."
Am I the only one who's concerned that two of America's greatest living actors are spending their golden years making mediocre to bad movies?
"A big fat zero...an exhaustingly busy cinematic puzzle, this year's Butterfly Effect--but even less entertaining."
"The film, like a TV show that paints everything in black and white and aims for tabloid-style shock value, proceeds along predictable lines."
"Even at 85 minutes, [it] feels longer than it should, enough so to feel much more like its original title: Homework."
"Although it was directed by Billy Wilder, this 1955 CinemaScope classic sometimes seems presided over by Frank Tashlin, with its satire of 50s puritanism and its use of wimpy Tom Ewell."
"In valiant pursuit of Hill's higher dignity, Mock finds only stability. Anita's well-meaning faithfulness squanders its cinematic potential."
"To quote a line from the movie, bad things happen and people get hurt."
"Despite the film’s bloated length, we simply never get enough time with one single event to understand how Whitney’s mind worked or why she made certain decisions. There is almost nothing new to learn about her life."
A completely pedestrian piece of entertainment... with a shrink-to-fit ending [that] builds to a dizzyingly ludicrous DIY climax; ...half-baked and over-baked at the same time.
Scream-a-thon.
You know a movie is bad when it's supposed to be a comedy but its first dozen or so jokes leave the audience in deathly silence.
The Brady Bunch Movie is just another weak attempt to hit our nostalgia buttons.
There's no spark or fire or passion - just a series of episodic military operations unfolding with only the odd minor reverse to spoil the party and Che going through several changes of facial ware.
Bland performance and massive indifference: not one of Mann's best efforts
"Shanley, who has not directed a feature film since his maiden misadventure almost twenty years ago with Joe Versus the Volcano, has neither the skill nor the perspective to turn his Broadway powerhouse into a movie of similar punch."
This fainthearted bid at social satire stars Nicolas Cage as a middle-aged man gazing into the yawning void of his life.
Jumper is a barely coherent genre mishmash about a guy who transports himself across the globe at will.
Mirthless family romp that hits all the lowest comedy dominators.
"Films set in different countries can teach us so much about other cultures. For example, did you know that Memoirs of a Geisha is Japanese for 'Sominex'?"
"Joyless, tastelss, and soulless, Last Action Hero can't decide if it's an actioner, a comedy or a spoof."
"Von Donnersmarck, who brilliantly depicted government surveillance in East Berlin before the fall of the wall in his earlier German film, astonishingly can't even find a way to make Interpol's spying interesting here."
"Rogerson lets the cameras roll, and we get real insight into daily prison life. But he doesn't stop to create context, and we feel stuck inside the razor wire."
"Can a gaijin ever be trusted like family, or will his motives ultimately be self-serving? It's an interesting question in a story that's otherwise completely devoid of interesting questions, but The Outsider is too enamored with its foreign star."
"The movie takes as its subject grown-ups' incomprehension of adolescent sexuality, but tells us nothing really new about it %u2014 the picture seems rather uncomprehending itself."
Simply not funny.
"For a jerky, clich-riddled yarn about the evils of fame, Undiscovered has enough sensitivity, wit, and inadvertent guffaws to rise above its lame underpinnings."
It does not succeed on merit.
"The best way to tell when things are getting bleak is to check Dakota Fanning's face. When she starts to look like a poached egg, that's when you better hide."
Duncan's summation of her life at age sixtysomething is as staccato as a telegram with bad news: 'Dissatisfaction -- fury -- and the clock ticking by.'
"The story of Samara Morgan, once potent nightmare fuel, has become less scary with each new iteration, culminating in this new, ridiculous installment directed by F. Javier Gutiérrez."
The film all too often has the feel of an acting exercise.
"The highlights of the entire movie are the imaginative pop-video-style sequences, which make clever use of stop-frame animation to bring the duo's songs to life. If only there was the same vim and vigour elsewhere in this otherwise plodding tale."
"Cautiously, Eastwood has chosen to omit Kyle's self-mythologizing altogether, which is itself a distortion of his character. We're not watching a biopic."
A dumbed-down comedy that descends into a bad soap opera.
"When you've resigned yourself to the tiresome body switch storyline, it's time to say goodbye."
"A great thriller should be the model of simplicity. Perfect Stranger, like so many other thrillers nowadays, is often complicated just for the sake of being complicated. This more-is-better approach isn't more, and it isn't better."
The lousy John Q all but spits out Denzel Washington's fine performance in the title role.
"A box office bomb that also had to endure a critical mauling, this subsequently enjoyed a healthy life on video and is now considered by many fanboys to be an exemplary action-fantasy-comedy. The truth actually rests between those two extremes."
What ultimately makes Windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story.
"While there is a great deal of laughter among the quartet, there's scarcely a giggle in it for the audience."
Dylan has to rely on Ferrell's manic energy to keep Kicking & Screaming a step ahead of Ladybugs in the youth soccer movie pantheon.
Guerschuny never manages to make The Film Critic much more than mildly cute.
"An austere film-making exercise, wallowing in anguish and despair. There's a reason why it was rejected by both Netflix and Amazon."
"While the monster battles are undeniably entertaining, The Great Wall comes to a screeching halt whenever it focuses on the people. The characters are frustratingly paper-thin, as is the plot."
"Mayday has elements of a good film, but they never come together, leading to one of Sundance's more frustrating experiences this year."
"Writer-director John Maclean insists at every opportunity that the American west teemed with brutality and that every positive myth about the region was built on a lie, yet he doesn't deliver this familiar revisionist history with much force."
"[Motherhood] not only overdoes its premise, but it's hampered by several flaws. When it tries to be serious, it's too earnest, and when it tries to strike a chord, it's banal."
"Predictably, the gross-out gags, ribald humor and action pieces don't work as well as in its 2014 predecessor, but it does reflect a frustrating, gender-based double-standard."
Portman spends most of her time crying or pouting.
"Stoller ... apparently has major trust issues with his odd-couple stars, women and the audience. Did I forget anybody?"
"While not especially good, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, directed by Scott Derrickson, is still a fascinating cultural document in the age of intelligent design."
"What conducts most of the energy is the warmth, charm and radiance generated by the two leads. They even sell the false notes with honesty, humanity, heart and sincerity."
"Amazon's new Cinderella is radical. Bad as it is, it dares to eliminate even the fantasy basis of traditional ethics, goodness, and scruples."
"The entire enterprise seems dated, as though the picture was made two months after the original movie rather than two decades."
"Even clocking in with a running time short of 90 minutes, the movie spins its wheels (in more ways than one) and repeats itself to the point of becoming ridiculous."
The title makes promises that the script cannot fulfill. There are better spy films that have come and gone with far less fanfare.
It offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment.
"There's little that's subtle about that combination of elements, nor about director Kriv Stenders and writer Stephen M. Irwin's exploration of the attitudes that both bind and divide contemporary Australia."
Violent chronicle of gangster's final descent into dementia.
"It helps to have energetic and gifted actors, but you really need to give them funnier things to do and say."
"The hollowness of the stories that lie behind each of these shameless heart-grabbers, laugh-getters and tear-jerkers becomes quickly apparent."
a surprisingly tedious checklist of Shane Black-isms
It&#8217;s rare to encounter a movie in which virtually every scene and line of dialogue feels false&#44; but this one manages the trick&#44; and tops everything off with an ending so misguided it boggles the mind&#46; 
"The central character simply comes across as whiny and entitled instead of troubled and dark, and the central theme of getting your groove back by acting like a kid again has been done many times by much more talented filmmakers."
"After a while, all these visual poetics start to feel like a pretentious means of suggesting enigmatic depth where there really is none."
"Hollywood doesn't know what to do with Kate McKinnon, so The Spy Who Dumped Me was perhaps inevitable."
Let's not and say we did.
"It might be fair to give Ben Stiller an 'A' for effort, but to call what he does in this movie ""acting"" is a misnomer. He does a lot of running around, occasionally falling down or bumping into things."
"No, Bee Season is just plain awful. That's right, awful, A-W-F-U-L, awful, and if that doesn't spell out my feelings succinctly I don't know what will."
"A half-decent comic premise gets beaten to death with lame slapstick, monotone performances and a hug-it-out finale."
"If only the whole matched the power and potency of the details. Masquerades as a searing exposé, but turns out to be a lurid and overwrought account."
[Anderson] misses out on the original film's theatricality of the racers and the dark humor of making targets out of pedestrians - a satire on the audience bloodlust to which Anderson cluelessly panders.
"To borrow Robert Evans's famous quotation about ""The Godfather,"" you can smell the spaghetti, but less sauce might have helped."
"It's not a very good noir, but compared to, say, Taylor's Traffik, which used the existence of sex trafficking to claim it was based on ""actual events,"" it represents substantial improvement."
It's atrocious. Twisted sociology.
"No movie could possibly capture the full emotional extravagance of such an individual, but Paul Schrader's Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters, despite some vivid moments, is an exasperatingly misconceived attempt. "
"The problem is that Weiner tells a fully expected story, leveraging laughs out of the politician's pre-mocked predicament, and shaping near-silent appearances by Abedin into a sympathy-courting foil."
Kooky Joan Cusack can't provide sufficient comic relief in this incredibly naive attempt at schmaltz.
"The film's reputation exceeds its achievements, and the ""true story"" angle has been vigorously disputed."
"If the subtext of this misbegotten parade of lame shock tactics is the death of cinema, then The Canyons certainly knows how to nail the coffin shut."
"You don't have to be a student of history to know that the trenches during World War I were horrific places to fight. Journey's End does not attempt to glorify that field of battle, but it also never quite fully commits to the true horror either..."
A lackluster&#44; contrived and vapid political thriller that&apos;s not nearly suspense&#44; emotionally engrossing or biting enough&#46;
"I can't really recommend it to anyone, unless it's one of those lazy video nights and you're in the mood to experiment."
Quite the worst animated movie of the year...
"When you've got cute young tourists, an exotic locale (well, sort of: Mexico), ancient Mayan hoodoo and surly peasants with machetes, you expect a bit more than The Ruins gives you, which is: killer plants."
"It felt disjointed. I loved God's Own Country but with this film, Francis Lee misses the mark for me which is down to the script rather than his direction."
"As I wasn't expecting much, I must say that Pirates doesn't disappoint."
"Turning a four-minute country tune into a viable feature-length film proves too daunting for this cliched drama about, well, hard luck, love, and songs."
"Clothes to die for, a script that needed more life."
"A tedious, labored affair that's only not boring when it's laughably over the top."
That sound you hear is of checkbooks closing all over Hollywood.
"Certain details about Rodriguez, especially his personal life, remain in shadow, calling into question whether they would have interfered with the inspirational narrative."
The mystery elements are just not very keen.
"The film feels like an elaborate therapy session, where its protagonist is hell-bent on ""finding himself"", even if he doesn't know that ""himself"" is what he is looking for."
Batla House openly [uses] the language of 'them' and 'us' - literally - with regard to Muslims.
A chill-deficient suspense flick that shares too much common ominous ground with [Judd's] past thrillers.
Finding Your Feet eventually managed to win me over despite its many hackneyed contrivances.
"Surely writers David Leslie Johnson and Alex Mace deserve their own circle of hell for thinking up the story, which moves with breathtaking cynicism from disturbing to grotesque to perverse to ludicrous."
"I can't imagine what type of picture there would be without Quinn and Schilling's commitment, but their professional investment helps to save a mediocre movie from becoming just another bland soul-searching drama."
"What you feel, watching Close, is not that you are watching gender being bent into new, absorbing shapes but that you might as well have stayed home and leafed through a book on Magritte."
The Aniston-Sandler pair is not enough to save this parody of mystery films (and novels). [Full review in Spanish]
Zwick and his cowriters (Marshall Herskovitz and Charles Randolph) are constantly letting Gyllenhaal and Hathaway down.
"At one point the actors are really trying to give, and it was clear that the movie wasn't giving back."
"With a thinnier, sillier story than ever before, the threequel is left with its twin pillars of appeal: musical performances by the core cast, and shtick, also by the core cast."
There is no need for a scene in which your hero loses touch with reality via cockeyed camera trickery and thumping techno music.
"We need to endure rather a lot of amateurish filmmaking to get to the raw, important story that's being told"
A slow build to nowhere.
Passable entertainment that ultimately reflects Disney's failure to find their new groove.
"An overstuffed, head-scratching paranoid thriller with shades of horror and sci-fi thrown in for sometimes confounding measure."
"A blind man who 'sees' in reel life. That's the tagline to draw you into Shadow, a film with such an improbable plot that you give up all expectations of logic, and wait helplessly for it to pass."
"At the end of the day, Basterds is a series of strongly made, if expertly (over)written, pieces that never really come together into one coherent whole."
"The true story is fascinating, groundbreaking and inspirational. It's a shame the cinematic treatment is predictable, conventional and trite."
"The film's bright spot is Q, who has really become a capable, confident, sexy action star. I can't wait to see her in another action movie that is not this one."
"Apart from reminding us of his well-documented affection for Ernst Lubitsch and the Hollywood comedies of the 1940s, [Bogdanovich] doesn't have anything to tell us - even after all this time away from the big screen."
Torres often strains to match the kookiness and kink that come so naturally to Almodvar and his ilk.
"It would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in Dragonfly, yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling, shamelessly manipulative and contrived, and totally lacking in conviction."
Overstuffed and formulaic...
"Sophomore slumps don't come any more irritating than ""Wish I Was Here,"" the painfully sincere, emotionally fraudulent new comedy-drama from actor-writer-director Zach Braff."
The only truly amazing thing about Carol director Todd Haynes' children's fable is its wholesale lack of authentic humanity.
It doesn't possess the serious edge necessary to effectively realize the source material's formidable warrior (nor does it stay faithful to the origins and conquests).
"Girls reveals plenty of potential, but nothing gels as Foner imagines, making the feature appealing and honest, but only periodically."
"It's not so much that the story is hard to follow -- it's that there's no real story being told at all. At World's End is packed with incident, but on a scene-to-scene level this leaky vessel just barely stays afloat."
"The tone wavers between the pantomime and the mawkish and while little has been lost in translation, less still has been gained."
Wonderstruck offers much to occupy the eyes and minds of movie buffs and Haynes fans. Yet there's little room left for insight and emotion in this overstuffed cabinet of curiosities.
"What do Robert Duvall and Melissa Leo have in common? They both have won an Oscar and they both cashed a paycheck for the fake virtuous hack job called ""Seven Days in Utopia."""
"Younger audiences will still find plenty to enjoy about Space Jam: A New Legacy, but LeBron James' trip to Tune World feels like it learned all the wrong lessons from the original film."
Will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002.
The movie is visually exhilarating&#44; but it suffers from the same problems as the original&#46; The movie is punishingly long&#44; and its thin storyline and cast of imminently forgettable characters don&#8217;t provide much payoff&#46; 
Purports to be concerned with the many fine lines between fantasy and reality though it succeeds only in celebrating torture and rape for cheap thrills.
"Despite bearing the stamp of horror king James Wan, La Llarona is dreadful, predictable and truly a must-miss."
"""The Snowman"" is like if aliens studied humanity and tried to make their own movie in an attempt to communicate with us."
It says nothing more useful than: isn't this shocking? Aren't we powerless to do anything about it?
"They say that death just follows around Clancy hero John Kelly. Regardless, don't blame Michael B. Jordan, the guy who plays him, for killing the movie. That distinction goes to an insanely convoluted screenplay and too many tedious action sequences."
"Actors such as Michael Clarke Duncan, Mo'Nique, Mike Epps and Cedric the Entertainer have been persuaded by writer-director Malcolm D. Lee to do crass routines that should have gone out with minstrel shows."
"Me Before You presents itself as classier than its genre, but it fundamentally delivers an imbalanced central relationship that comes off as quite sexist."
"It's barely a movie at all, more like a thousand car commercials spliced together in an hour."
"47 Meters Down sinks rather than swims, even if there are a few buoyant moments along the way."
The plot grows increasingly ludicrous as additional details are revealed.
"A film that, unfortunately, with a very ephemeral result. [Full review in Spanish]"
It amounts to making entertainment for adults by hijacking a story intended for kids...
"It's got some strong action sequences and some clever touches, but mostly the film gets bogged down in a ludicrous, hole-filled plot."
"Convincingly pointless and breezy in its hedonistic hokum...Hence, the third time around is not the charm for this foolish and faceless fright flick."
Too bad that the final sequences try to be magical and ends up in no man's land. [Full review in Spanish]
These days&#44; the world&#8217;s largest entertainment franchise is capable only of churning out advertisements for itself&#46;
"If you enjoyed the early Bond films as much as I did, you'd better skip this one."
"John Lithgow and Blythe Danner make an offbeat and winning combination, with total belief that they're in a really good movie. Unfortunately, they're not."
The filmmakers mistakenly think nothing is silly if it's done with a grim enough facial expression.
"There are a few terrific thrills, and some eerie moments of dislocation that only Kubrick could achieve, but most of the movie is unfelt, unscary, and bizarrely heavy-handed. It's the first pompous haunted-house movie. "
Feels as though everyone involved forced themselves to grit their teeth and get on with it.
"What does it say about a film when you come out going ""well, it looked pretty nice""? Not much, in this reviewer's opinion."
"The stakes don't seem all that high, despite claims of world-ending consequences. If what you want is schlocky fun, then John Dies at the End should deliver. If you want something more, then you may want to look elsewhere afterwards."
"Throughout, Barbarians oscillates between smugness and apprehensiveness about the film that its trying to be."
The warmed over humor is a tired one-trick pony that spit the bit barely 15 minutes into the original.
"As revisionist holiday fables go, you're better off watching Aardman's delightful Arthur Christmas than this lump of coal."
"The direction, by Robert Ellis Miller, is flat -- as if neither he nor anyone else had any confidence in the material. He and the rest were right, of course."
"Like the star's acting, the movie is bland, full of good intentions and generally as stiff as a fireplace poker."
"Suspend your disbelief and you might find The Time Traveler's Wife a charming if mildly depressing fantasy. Or you might, as I did, travel elsewhere during it. Either way, at least it's a picturesque journey."
"It could have been a much better movie. But, unfortunately, Al Pacino can only play one character at a time."
"There are a number of things it does right -- among them the hiring of poor, talented Jonathan Lynn to direct -- but none of them have even the potential to transcend the overwhelming inanity of the plot, which is one part cliche and two parts complete id"
The film doesn't hit with the impact it should.
"The movie is in love with death, and even if that doesn't bother you, you won't be able to stomach the preposterous narrative and visual manipulations that director Tony Scott unleashes in this Tony Scottiest of films."
"A watchable if not particularily compelling tale of the never-ending woes of the protagonist, a walking basket case of self-destruction.The Coens are trying to say what?"
"Thappad's exaggerated screenplay isn't equipped to distill any new insight on the Indian mentality toward displays of male force, taking refuge instead in existing tropes."
"Chloe & Theo is a mess of a message movie, simplistic, sappy, silly."
"...while not following the same playbook of the first two, [Part III] is an equally lazy, unfunny slog that fails to even indulge in the raunchy excesses these guys are known for."
"How particular can this set of skills really be when we see them so often? Outside of a physically persuasive performance from Mary Elizabeth Winstead & a couple of nimble fights, ""Kate"" feeds the content machine a meal it hasn't had in a few weeks."
Maybe the worst thing this forgettable remake does is associate &#8220;Goodnight Mommy&#8221; with being soft and dull when the original is absolutely something much more severe and scarring&#46;
American Sniper may have been served better if Eastwood had let Cooper show more of the complexities of this real-life figure.
The Snowman registers both as a bad thriller and a kind of anti-tourism ad that makes you never want to go to Oslo.
"Perhaps it was necessary in the name of clarity, but, in spite of the inherently crazy story, a straightforward retelling becomes a bit rote after a while, especially in the third act."
"Dreamland doesn't quite work, but [Robbie] deserves an A for effort."
"Its cheap jump scares follow one another at a cruising speed, based on sound effects or worn-out tricks, and the film does not have a particularly original atmosphere. [Full Review in Spanish]"
The Love Guru isn't really about spiritual well-being or hockey; it's about Myers' mistaken belief that the comedic possibilities of male genitalia are endless.
"I pretty much hated it. Like the zombie spoof Fido from a couple of weeks ago, this is a one-joke movie -- and the one joke gets old fast."
"For Cage, it's just another quick roadside stop on a seemingly endless B-movie journey."
"Frustrating and tone-deaf, the movie remembers the L.A. riots as an absurd comedy."
The last fifteen minutes is pretty good but that end does not justify the earlier means.
"If you like being hectored, preached at and told you're wrong, then this is the film for you."

"Diamonds feels like it was conceived as a showcase for Douglas at 83, and so it is, but what a dreary story and unconvincing characters he has been surrounded with."
"In a film so hellbent on promoting its own vault of material, it's futile to propose a title change to Server Jam, but at least that would've been more appropriate."

"Keaton and Holmes should seriously consider firing their agents, as they both deserve better than this."
"It's a blockbuster trying to zoom to screen glory on four flat tires, growing more tedious the harder it tries to peacock instead of electrify. As far as 2012 is concerned, Mirror Mirror is the fairest one of all."
"As a thriller Deception isn't deceptive or thrilling enough; it's like a puzzle one can put together too easily and, when finished, doesn't reveal much of value."
"This Frankenstein's monster of a horror film may display genuine affection for the genre but, aside from the occasional giggle-inducing moment, exhibits all the energy of a limp corpse."
"Forget diving straight into the deep end, as this is one of the most shallow comedy experiences in quite some time."
The cartoonish way in which the characters are played drains the film of any grittiness the setting is supposed to provide.
"Despite a committed performance by Simon Pegg, the challenges of portraying mental illness on screen prove troublesome for this otherwise earnest drama."
Never comes close to being as wild and&#44; ahem&#8230; gutsy&#44; as it tries to be

"When people gripe about Hollywood's reliance on sequels and cheap franchise cash-ins, this is the kind of movie they mean: no Grimm's Fairy Tale, but a grim tale nonetheless."

"Waters can't develop a consistent tone, and the script -- credited to no less than four writers -- crumbles like cheap eyeshadow."
"Photographers, like writers, do not usually make the best film subjects. Director Dawn Porter, who also directed John Lewis: Good Trouble, doesn't find a good way around this."
This surprisingly critical portrayal of a cyclist's utopia raises all kinds of issues about traffic planning and bike safety that the doc does not address.
You never really connect with these lovers any more than they connect with each other.
"""The Watch"" is a Dream Team in which no one's drawn up any plays and nobody passes the ball. Everybody just shoots and hopes for the best."
A prime example of a dispiriting trend: movies whose primary point of reference is other movies.

The theoretically fail-safe team of the writer/actor Seth Rogen and co-writer/ producer Judd Apatow - the Knocked Up duo - deliver a funnybone- clobbering spree with more energy than wit.
Come True does a great job masquerading as something intelligent and it almost succeeds.
Shadow feels like a missed opportunity.
Creepy atmospherics aren't enough to compensate for the muddled storyline.
"Whatever charges you can level at the movie, and they are legion, boring isn't one of them."
"It contains some interesting visuals, great sound editing, and a decent score by Game of Thrones' Ramin Djawadi. However, as a villain origin story, which it purports itself to be, Dracula Untold is an absolute failure."
"Tiresomely plot-driven and unnecessarily drawn-out, Royal Engagement is the prim and proper cousin to its comparatively anarchic predecessor."
"Isn't as sharp as the original...Despite some visual virtues, 'Blade II' just doesn't cut it."

A holiday farce that pairs a colorful cast with a generic filmmaker.

"Like so many modernized supersized reboots, this one is twice as long and half as good."
"Marred by shoddy special effects and half-formed fantastical conceits, Terry Gilliam's ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"" has the feeling of a comic fantasia desperately seeking to find its rhythm."

"The film is such a misfire, such a disappointing collection of failed attempts at emotional affect and confounding storytelling choices, that it seems more like a bad director's attempt to rip off Jackson's style than his own work."
"Wired is in some ways a sincere attempt to deal with the material, but it is such an ungainly and hapless movie, so stupidly written, so awkwardly directed and acted, that it never gets off the ground."
"Zoo avoids any taint of exploitation, but it errs on the opposite extreme. I came away from it wanting a little less Art and a lot more simple reportage."

"[The Nightingale] tries hard to be as bleak as possible, but winds up feeling rather one-note."
"Cold, unmoving, and desperately in need of a beating heart and a soaring soul, Minority Report is one of the most depressing disappointments of the year."

An eyerollingly silly script and a less than convincing performance from a rogue CGI lion ate away at all my enjoyment.
"Blessed with a perfect title, Erased will quickly disappear from the memory."
Pretty to look at but shallow deep&#46;
"A vague hint at spiritual rebirth in the closing seconds does nothing to wash away the acid taste of this character, and he's all there is to the movie."
"This is one of those movies where guys literally stand in line, waiting to get beaten up."
the end result feels like business as usual done by-the-book.
"Had loads of potential to be truly frightening, or at least intriguing, but it's dead on arrival."
The pummeling and plotting grow tedious.

Queen made great albums; Bohemian Rhapsody is just a playlist.
The film is a structural failure&#46; Butler&#44; who pours his heart and soul into every moment&#44; deserves so much more&#46;

"Skip it, if you don't like guns, explosions or Kurt Russell."
"...it's not tense enough, realistic enough, or exciting enough to lift it much beyond the ordinary."
"This brittle, satirical romance is plagued by thick British accents that make it difficult to deceipher much of the dialogue. Perhaps it just doesn't cross the pond too well."
"It almost ends up being an entertaining, guilty pleasure sort of misfire. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, Nudity, etc. - also Available)"
"...for all its moments of brilliance that rival anything Roeg ever did, Eureka fails. The film stumbles under one of the weakest scripts he ever dealt with."

"Overall, RINGS is sadly disappointing."
"Nope is a movie about aliens in which fear comes too late, and collective survival is not a priority. That self-absorption is the allegory of the times. [Ful. review in Spanish]"

"If you're going to set a faith-vs.-uncertainty debate in the heart of a church milieu, shouldn't some of the characters at least mention the beliefs that they've not just dedicated their lives to, but built them around?"
Another useless recycling of a brutal mid-'70s American sports movie.

What is it with the Smurfs? Why do people like them? Why have people always liked them?
Some of this is funny. A fair amount of it -- including the toilet joke -- isn't.

A movie winking at its hero's age is only fun when we can root for an unlikely burst of energy without worrying about the big guy breathing too heavily to deliver his lines.
"This newest version of Mortal Kombat is ultimately a mess, attempting to mask the narratives various flaws with ultra-violent action, and not entirely sure what kind of movie it's trying to make."

"While it arrives decorated with cooler hair and a louder soundtrack, it still sticks to the ""Unusual Outsider Teaches Middle-Class People What It Means to Really Live"" template."
"The movie doesn't tell us anything we haven't heard before, and more eloquently, in other movies."

Probably the worst superhero movie I've ever seen. [Full review in Spanish]
"Based on Christianna Brand's Nurse Matilda kid's book series, one can see how the material might have had potential, if the cast were not pressing so much for laughs."

This moderately intriguing thriller tends to further trivialize the remarkable story of its enigmatic subject.
Tiresome and plodding.
The eruption itself makes for some pyrotechnic thrills but the action and romance don't produce many sparks ...
"Instead of pride or anger or resolve, all it left me feeling was a little bit of regret that I hadn't been home, watching ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"" instead."
This take on Cinderella never once shows itself to have a reason for existence. We've seen so many better versions of this story.
"A threepenny opera of lurid plot turns, oceanic bloodletting, and pseudo-existential dialogue."
"A Jerry Bruckheimer-produced video game adaptation-it has to be good, doesn't it? (Ya, sarcasm.)"
"Director Gentry does a lot with clutter, small spaces and darkness to create a mood of paranoia, but neither he nor the writers have worked out a way to make Broadcast Signal Intrusion deliver what it seems to promise."
"A very messy endeavor that wants to live in the good ol' days of the 80s without being held to the improved standards of modern action movies. It's rushed, overstuffed and frequently loses its own focus."
The movie's run of the mill stuff - fairly entertaining but not particularly inventive - with the standard twists and turns. Yet another film featuring a cute but horrific serial killer fixated on a beautiful and intelligent female law officer.
The Lovers is a dispiriting parade through all of the worst parts of adulthood.
This tragic effort at a homegrown comedy delivers second hand laughs.
"Neither outstandingly good, nor bad. It's a reliable choice for the historical action keener."
"By the climactic, tragically 'ironic' denouement, you feel as if you've been made to pay for all the early, dirty fun."
"The black comic aspects of this gloomy paradox are never fully realised. I kept wishing that it had fallen into the hands of Armando Iannucci (The Death of Stalin, Veep), a social satirist with all the gifts to make it work."
"Watching good actors let their hair down can be fun, but watching them let their standards down isn't."
This romantic comedy/fantasy goes exactly where we expect it to go. (And that can't be considered a serious plot 'spoiler'. Anyone who's ever seen a movie fantasy will be able to predict this film's ending.)
"Bellocchio is a master craftsman, but his talents are wasted on this thin material."
"Even at its most entertaining, this film never really gets you to suspend your disbelief and invest in its characters. For now at least, Dwayne Johnson has nothing to worry about."
A rather unimaginative thriller.
Its smug&#44; glazed beauty walled me off from feeling anything about it except impatience&#46;
"Since the majority of the movie resembles a long, stylized music video, the DJ just might be the most important recruit of them all."
"A particularly cynical brand of celluloid nihilism, in which über-wealthy movie producers finance their Hollywood mansions by marketing films to an audience feeling disenfranchised by the status quo."
Each scene in The Holiday is more annoying than the last.
"Drop Dead Gorgeous doesn't drop dead, but the gags often arrive like planks hitting our heads."
"San Andreas ticks off all disaster-movie requirements as it runs its characters through a mill of ever-escalating challenges. But if you're looking for a challenging film, San Andreas would itself qualify as a disaster."
"Blake Lively gives it her all in The Rhythm Section, but the movie only meets her halfway."
"Witherspoon lacks the abandon the May-December love angle requires, and the movie is so tidily formulaic that it feels as if it's been airbrushed; the send-up of Hollywood falls flat too."
...it's a wonder that Joe Carnahan was able to find a second gig.
"It's a mess, son"
"There's something relentlessly superficial about the movie, and in one area that cries out for sensitivity -- the treatment of racial differences among the characters -- it falls down badly."
"No one involved in The Dark Tower seems to have given a damn about what they turned out, so why should anybody else?"
"Though a clearly gifted new filmmaker, Lugacy doesn't get a handle on the combustible material, and she gets scalded in the process."
Sully's exploit lasted about three minutes. So even at 95 minutes the movie feels stretched and padded.
"I forgot Unknown by the time I got to the car; it was a real act of will to call it up again long enough to review it, and I'm already forgetting it again."
An unpretentious film whose destiny it is to toil in the shadow of Steven Spielberg's Jaws.
The dark and bittersweet twist feels strange as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film. First-timer John McKay is never able to pull it back on course.
"Occasionally features some exciting moments here and there, but otherwise feels dull and only points out how some of the past entries in the series were so much better. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
Whose side the documentarians are on is never clear -- in a muddy rather than an ambiguous way. Did anyone die from the Weathermen's bombings? We don't find out here.
How did an apparently sincere tribute turn into such a weirdly clueless vanity project?
"If it only took craftsmanship to make a haunted house movie, The Changeling would be a great one."
"...the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex, outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs."
So bad it takes points away from BATMAN BEGINS.
Aggressively mean and even more aggressively stupid.
"It's handsome, well-paced, and nicely acted, but suffers from a fatal lack of purpose, as if Dorling and Nyswaner couldn't commit to whatever movie they wanted to make."
"The story is all over the map, and ""Voyagers"" never capitalizes on its intriguing premise."
Forget government conspiracies about aliens -- what about the entertainment media&apos;s conspiracy to persuade America that this movie doesn&apos;t suck&#63;
Pity it doesn't bend many cinematic rules along the way.
"Congratulations, John Cusack! You star in the worst movie of the year!"
It's hard to muster the attention span to care about Earth's Mightiest Heroes when we know they'll just be back to do it all again in a few years.
"A movie based on a video game based on two entirely separate sci-fi horror series -- so whatever was interesting in the originals has long been bred out, like double-jointedness."
...the same time our government debates torture...our movie industry produces another heinous horror flick that centers on the cruel and unusual punishment of captive humans.
"Chazelle whips the story into cream-puff whorls of myths upon myths. He delivers a movie that's neither unified nor disparate but homogenized, its elements of reality and hyperbole alike assimilated to the same creamy glow of rueful wonder."
It's a fun espionage thriller and Florence Pugh is a marvel. But didn't it also feel extremely phoned in?
"While the material is slight, the movie is better than you might think."
"Heist goes from lousy to even worse. The screenplay is so clunky, not a single cast member manages to sound believable. Familiar, likable actors from Kate Bosworth to Gina Carano to Morris Chestnut are buried under an avalanche of awful."
"Here's a shocker: In Pixels, his latest, Adam Sandler plays a stunted man-child who turns out to be very, very special."
Just not the best director Sam Raimi is capable of offering his audience...
"The gloomiest and grisliest of the X-Men franchise is expertly crafted in detail but overlong, dreary and dispiriting as a whole."
"[T]his is a film about catharsis and camaraderie, not logic."
"In Hollywood, it's all about the concept, and some studio executive must have thought it would be fun to watch Adams slogging around in the Irish mud. Unfortunately, there's no accounting for taste."
Mid90s thinks it's about resilience. Actually it's about stupidity.
"A postcard-pretty portrait of feminist icon Gloria Steinem, Julie Taymor's The Glorias fails to deliver."
Cool critters foiled by every time-travel trope ever... as if someone transplanted a great idea for a monster movie into the cheapest derivative script available...
It's almost as if Sigismondi and the writers are daring the audience to say nice things about their reworking of James' source material.
Kills takes the respect earned by it&apos;s predecessor and squanders it for buckets of gore&#46; Myers continues to be a standout as he tears through a series-high bodycount&#46; The script and characters&#59; however&#44; are the movie&apos;s biggest fatalities&#46;
"For churchgoers it's a nice change of scenery, a visual aid beyond stained glass to reaffirm faith. For the rest of us, it's a trap. We're reminded how cruel the world can be, and if we don't believe in Spencer's pies, we stay miserable."
"Had it been any longer than 80 minutes, I would have given serious thought to making an early exit."
Mr. Steiger bellows and weeps and overdoes absolutely everything. He won't even pick up the phone before it's rung 12 or 15 times.
"Although director Chase Ogden dutifully captures that nagging call of the wild, he misses a golden opportunity to more thoroughly investigate the formative stimuli that prompted the seemingly carefree Giraud to pursue his limit-pushing lifestyle..."
It's a great idea but there are too many confusing sup-plots and no satisfactory resolution.
"Murphy may want to disappear whenever he can, but if he let loose some more, he might not need a facade to hide behind ever again."
"A cereal pack of space-and-psych movie clichs, scrambled together like Fruit Loops but recognizable in bite-size doses."
"Instead of tapping into that dramatic potential by asking difficult emotional and systemic questions, Howard habitually reaches for the comfort of sentimentality and simplicity."
"There's possibly a provocative documentary in that, but Long Live Rock finally feels like an ode to this tribal art form that doesn't possess much appeal, despite its intentions, to those outside the tribe."
"The film's signature song, the Oscar-winning ""Whole New World,"" fares a bit better and Massoud and Scott sing their hearts out to great affect. Overall, Aladdin has flashes of greatness but ends up an overlong retread."
"Instead of the clear-headed resolve the material demands, Beresford's film offers slush, blarney and grandstanding actors ..."
Little children wake and listen
"The film is like Jason Bourne fan fiction in how much it completely reworks things we've seen before, only with a few more years of cyberterrorism buzzwords to give viewers the illusion of not just depth but a plot."
"Excessive best-bud banter gives the movie an improv feel, not in a good way, and the film transitions from light comedy to dead-earnest drama with the subtlety of a malfunctioning gearshift clutch."
Wish Upon is a Final Destination redux that pulls too many punches.
The Final Destination is a catastrophe in and of itself.
I couldn't wait for this movie to end.
There&#8217;s something so dispiriting about seeing talented people drowning in a comedy that can&#8217;t find the rhythm of its own jokes&#46;
"To me, ""Joy"" ... played more like pandering - creating a role-model ""survivor"" rather than a truly whole and complicated person, elevating one character only by tearing down everyone else."
"Almost completely unfunny and mostly uninspired, The Wild Life coasts by on attractive visuals alone. Otherwise, this is a painful 90 minutes."
"There's more flab than muscle packed on this galumphing franchise reboot, which, as it lumbers from scene to scene, reminds you of what a great action god Steven Spielberg is. Too bad he didn't take the reins on this."
"If unfunny isn't enough, the flick is also guilty of unforgivable smugness."
The Legend of Zorro is a sequel that arrives too late to benefit from any of its predecessor movie's residual warm fuzzies.
It is a facsimile of a good film. Or perhaps a parody of one.
A head-scratching disappointment that's as frustratingly unsatisfying as anything I've seen this year.
Drier and dustier than just about any academic-history text out there.
"Unfocused and too often unbelievable, Amy Poehler's ""Moxie"" feels like a battle between two competing visions: go-girl crowd-pleaser and serious high-school harassment drama. Neither wins."
"Like the old adage about too many cooks, The Tale of Despereaux is full of ideas, but the combination is more perturbing than satisfying."
"The villains here chart new territory in one-dimensionality, the essential storyline is bereft of surprise and the picture ends where most Robin Hood tales -- sensibly, as it turns out -- begin."
It strays too far from the original to please hard-core fans and it is so confused in tone and purpose that it is hard to tell where it's aimed.
"Oh, how we miss the likes of Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Katharine Hepburn. And even more, the funny, witty, adorably romantic scripts penned by men like Billy Wilder and Ernst Lubitsch."
The movie feels thoroughly like a project Gilliam did halfheartedly&#44; just to stay in the game&#46;
Irritating vulgarity. [Full review in Spanish] 
"Aftermath, with its promising premise, could have been an intense drama but what you get instead is a wandering, forgettable story that reeks of nothingness."
"The romance with Stefan, steamy though it is, is unnecessary baggage, a sexy distraction from a quietly devastating story about a marriage gutted by loss and estrangement."
Its 95 minutes feel like a trimester...
If you're willing to take a trip to Romantic Comedyland...
How ridiculous is this? They depend on cellphones that even work in the remote jungle.
"Very much the visual version of the wildly popular YA novel, complete with voiceover for the choice bits of narration that its legions of fans presumably couldn't live without."
"Right in the beginning, a minor character asks Sidhu: &#147;Are you stupid?&#148; He nods. That&#146;s prescience."
"Glibly portrays selfishness as a life choice, ranking gluttony on a par with finding God and a life partner."
La Douleur? Oui. Et les longueurs!
"Twenty-five years later, this new version brings little to nothing new. [Full Review in Spanish]"
All the well-meaningness in the world can't erase the fact that The Believer feels like a 12-Step Program for the Jewish Nazi.
"Ironically, as the credits are rolling, Eastwood finally deigns to elevate the music and the energy to a level that the preceding 132 minutes could have desperately used."
"Jack Nicholson fans should feel cheated by Man Trouble, an insultingly trivial star vehicle."
"The stitching of Veber's contrived entanglements falls apart at the tug of a thread, because nobody onscreen buys the ruse being perpetrated."
Lacklustre mix of dated screwball and Irish whimsy.
Comedies don't come much flatter.
"Surprisingly flatlines less than it should . . . But 90 minutes after its intriguing opening, Eagle Eye zooms beyond its reassurance that, hey, basically everything's OK post-Patriot Act, folks, to resurrect a Hollywood happy ending from the dead."
"The weakness of Black Girl is in its slow, journeyman style; one feels that Sembene learned filmmaking by making this film."
Becomes a vanity project bathed in poignancy.
"Not only does it offer nothing new, it offers something old, out of date and not very exciting."
"Kadeem Hardison is the best thing about this film, playing Maximillian's slowly rotting ghoul henchman. However; one has to wonder about a film where Eddie Murphy needs comic relief."
"The movie ultimately feels exhausting, raising issues it doesn't have the energy to address (about morality, the role of journalists, the public's right to know) and presenting a wide-eyed Rice as a lamb led to slaughter."
Retitled this to I Know What You Did at That Sorority Party with That Tire Iron.
Americans might want to approach him first on the printed page rather than the hyperactive Zizek!
An L.A. neo-noir raised to an insufferable degree of artiness.
"It is an anecdotal, nostalgic, crowd-pleasing coffee-table book of a film, neither shocking nor challenging."
I feel confident that Confidence will not end up anyone's short list of great caper films.
"Were it not for the participation of two A-list actors, Nicole Kidman and Colin Firth, Before I Go to Sleep would have been headed straight to video."
"A boozy Irish-American cop, a sweary African-American cop and a bent Italian-American cop walk into a brothel. What do you get? The climax of the least original cop movie in the world. And that's exactly what we've got here."
"Cherry comes across as a film that tried desperately to stuff everything in, and in doing so, ironically hollowed out the story."
"Humiliating for both US citizens and Mexicans alike, towards each of the characters and in each one of the scenes. [Full review in Spanish]"
"This one is geared more toward the volleyball players we see early on, leaping and spiking in the sand."
There's nothing particularly surprising here. Not even the rather tediously obvious 15-minute all-nude lesbian f*ckfest.
"The film feels epic in scope, visually at least, but the depth of its deep-focus composition is bitterly at odds with the flimsiness of its characterization and plotting."
"Apart from the under-seven set, it's hard to imagine anyone not being agonizingly wearied by the interminable cascade of lowbrow slapstick and Rube Goldberg set pieces."
"Dikkers' ""Onion"" connection raises expectations that the film can't meet."
"The fights are parceled out at intervals during the last half, all leading to a climactic battle. But it's hard to build suspense when you know it is coming and you know who will win."
A culture-clash comedy that tries too hard to please the back rows
A contemporary premise with serious dramatic potential is all but squandered by dull direction and emotionally clinical acting.
"Ephron and Resnick seem to have lost their way home, allowing the story to unfold rather aimlessly after a reasonably sound set-up."
"Leads to a trip to a gay bar and a resolution that is as unsatisfying as it is unbelievable, not to mention pretty tame by LaBute standards."
"Neither Goldman nor Kasdan had made a horror film in their 65 joint years in Hollywood, and they were the wrong people to entrust with this one."
"A waste of time, money, effort and talent - and yet another reminder that games and film are two very distinct mediums that rarely should or do coalesce."
"If it's remembered at all, it will be seen as a missed opportunity to tell a powerful story."
"Never mind giving 1000 chimps 1000 typewriters and having them produce a script in a week. Instead, give 1000 chimps $US100 million and see how long it takes them to come up with a blancmange blockbuster such as this."
I miss the the world we lived in before I saw Winchester.
"If a ship flips over and it's full of people that nobody cares about, does it matter if anyone makes it out alive? Allow me to answer that rhetorical question...no."
"... slogs from disaster to ordained disaster to a disastrously soggy ending, with dialogue as bankrupt as Jimmy's business and as ungiving as his bookie."
"The semi-plausible Day Zero, a rather formulaic male buddy saga, asks hypothetical questions about the impact of a reinstated draft on three vastly different amigos, well played by Klein, Wood, and particularly Bernthal."
"The Surrogate proposes an interesting moral quandary, one that might have been explored in more depth with a better script. But ultimately, the baffling characterization of Jess lets the film down."
"With its awful ending, the whole film ends up as embarrassing as telling someone what it is you've just watched."
"The set design, by future director Derek Jarman, is probably the most successful element of the film."
"Julia Louis-Dreyfus... is effective in bringing out Billie's frustration. However, the issues of the movie are beyond her control, a real case of 'force majeure'?"
In between the farcical ballets of ungainly violence we're offered scene after scene of interminable dialogue delivered by actors so endearingly inept that you'll begin to sympathize with them.
I'll be straight with you: this movie is awful.
"We actually begin to laugh at the inanity of it all, wanting to yell at the screen: 'Just shut up and dance!'"
Uncle Drew is exactly what one would expect of a movie produced by a soft drink company and based on a character created for a series of commercials.
"Back in my day, when we were certain the new, odd neighbor was a vampire we'd spend the bulk of the second act in knots because nobody, nobody, would believe us."
I am apparently allergic to 'Peanuts.'
The movie's primary interest seems to be in following several good-looking men wherever they care to meander.
"Expensive movies aren't necessarily good movies, and although we see many exceptions, Pearl Harbor is testimony enough of that."
Maybe the problem is that novel...
Bleak and underwhelming outback thriller about greed.
"It's a movie where every pause is long and every line of dialogue is supposed to carry great meaning, but ultimately sounds weighed down by excess pretension."
"Sorry gang, but 2005's variation on 1979's original is no more successful or scary than that bizarrely popular film was."
So weirdly clueless that the only appropriate responses are jaws dropping or laughter.
There is no mention of the corporation's rap sheet. A cursory glance reveals innumerable instances of the fast food giant's malfeasance on a global scale.
... a movie that beats you over the head until you -- along with all the fanged and furry beasts of the future -- are senseless.
"The problem is that the ghostly culprit, some sort of nature spirit, isn't nearly as terrifying as the arguments that Pollack makes, or the fact that the ice in such places really is weakening."
As an escaped slave stoically and doggedly running from hunters in Civil War Louisiana&#44; The Shortcomings of Actor Will Smith are on full display&#46;
"Few would claim there are no flies on this one, but at least the outstanding 3D effects are some compensation for the dumbed-down inanity of everything else."
"I suggest you get out the books, which for once can truly be said to be more spectacular than the movie."
"The Danish Girl is stunning to look at but rarely powerful to behold, technically accomplished yet also dramatically inert."
"Here we are, only nine months after the Sex and the City movie, and an obsessive spender with an overstuffed closet -and credit card bills to match- no longer seems quite so cute."
This film should be so empowering&#44; but it falls flat&#46;
A long slog of family cliché and idiotic coming-of-age yuks thrown at us with the subtlety of a naked Garry Marshall.
This is special-effects wizard Ray Harryhausen's baby.
"Like Tom Hanks' motion capture-animated character in The Polar Express, onscreen Vardalos appears completely dead behind the eyes, chillingly blank as if she's a wood figure who came to life."
"Without the first movie's element of surprise the joke goes stale fast, and laughs grow few."
"Consumed by the urge to shock, he lays on so much gratuitous nonsense in his lead-up to the hyperkinetic climax that the actors themselves seem unconvinced by what they're called upon to do and the whole thing collapses into absurdity and tedium."
Is the movie good enough to do what it's designed to do? Not really.
A hit-and-miss drama.
"There is much to enjoy here, but is there ever really any justification for a two-hour long zombie movie? Train To Busan argues not."
"Jackman shuffles along with zombie obligation, as though he can't believe how much money he's been paid to go through these motions."
Roger Moore's last Bond and not before time.
"Luis Buñuel's final film is regarded as a masterpiece but disappoints as shallow, vaguely sexist look at a cursed romance between a rich old Frenchman and a teen tease played by two different actresses."
You could get whiplash from his movie's mood swings.
Holy hokum.
"The problem with Five Feet Apart is that it chooses to focus on the weakest narrative - a dull, sappy romance that is heavy on melodrama and light on realism."
"Sitting on the shelf for nearly five years hasn't done ""Above Suspicion"" any favors, but it proves Emilia Clarke is a timeless and versatile actress who deserves better."
"Luc Besson's clunky, space-bound actioner apes '80s B-flick excess but skimps on all the good parts."
"In the end, Troy is an empty Trojan horse, likely to be swept under the rug in early July by the arrival of King Arthur."
"Wears out its welcome, and energy, through unswerving conformity to its dramatic scheme."
You know a sequel serves no other purpose than to make money when it has no respect for the rules and history it has set up for itself.
All digital dazzle and little substance.
"Where did all the money go? That's all I could think about while watching Miami Vice, the summer stinker for this week."
"The Boondock Saints, sorry to say, wasn't worth the trouble."
"An after-school special posing as Booty Call, stumbling badly over its clunky message-movie scripting."
A flawed but amusing at times comedy that tries to cover far more than it really needs to.
"If you want to see the movie that made mild diversion for ten-year-old boys the model of commercial filmmaking, ruling out nuanced characterization and emotions that last longer than 20 seconds, this is where to look."
Bel Canto trades what could have been stimulating and exciting for simplistic emotional gains and familiarity so brazen that the actors might as well be reading plot points from a checklist.
The tortuous mystifications and ponderings (shakily shored up by the revelation that she sometimes suffers bouts of amnesia) wear out their welcome long before the final gush of explanations.
"To really do its source material justice, Get Smart needed to get a whole lot smarter."
"If Conviction had felt as edgy and urgent as Lewis' performance, brimming with surprising comedy and unhinged tension, then it would be far more enticing."
"Cage merely stands around looking glum, letting his hair extensions do the acting for him."
Stutters with repetition and monotonous episodes.
"There are certain movies that you really want to like based on their ambition, or their weirdness, or their ambitious weirdness, and ultimately you just can't. Ben Wheatley's High-Rise is one of those movies."
They had 20 years to prepare and this is the best they could do?
"Inferno begs to be made fun of, but it's impossible to do so given how Ron Howard reduces the material to a dull spectacle of earnest puzzle-solving."
"Americans desperately need to have some difficult conversations about the state of public education, but Won't Back Down goes about the task too awkwardly to be helpful or interesting."
"A hollow concept gussied up with a few big names, a pretty set and some fancy clothes."
We end up with an almost saintly portrait that glosses over milestones&#44; mostly skips internal conflicts&#44; and favors a passionate yet overcooked romance&#46;
Outside the Wire repeatedly pushes the central irony of pairing an emotionally detached human with a compassionate killing machine without drawing any meaningful conclusions from their contrasting personalities.
"Rather than face its own moral incoherence, Deadpool 2 blinks."
"Even if Red Rocket does feel like it captures something about our national makeup, it's a draining experience to spend so much time with Mikey..."
Penelope Cruz is outstanding in an otherwise lame male fantasy.
It's Johnson's committed central performance -- in a movie with a lot of shortcomings -- that only underlines the fact that he's got an awful lot of charisma and screen presence and hasn't yet had a truly great vehicle to channel that talent into.
"The gangland clichés can be cringe-worthy at times, particularly when the film emphasizes Lansky's Jewish background."
Loktev's persistent use of long takes with little dialogue renders it a repetitive exercise that's more pretentious than profound.
"A movie that benefits from -- but doesn't make very good use of -- the history and the chemistry between its stars, David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson."
"That's the film's first shortcoming-namely, that it doesn't really make a single, lucid point."
"There's the frustrating sense of ideas bubbling too low beneath the surface, of mordant jokes serving as an end rather than a means."
"Gabe Polsky's film took an age to get going, which made it run far longer than the story merited. As for that story, there was too much of everything, from strippers on the ice at half-time to bears serving drinks."
"When the fat lady finally sings -- the filmmakers turn up the volume and the visuals explode. It's these sensations, and not necessarily the content, that might overwhelm some youngsters."
"In 1988, Gary Hart's promising presidential candidacy fizzled out. Perhaps it's only fitting that his movie follows suit."
This should make for fine family friendly entertainment. But the problem with Wonder Park is that it is neither rich in storytelling nor production design.
"Most of its supposed observations sound more like touchy-feely mumbo-jumbo than honest, useful information and advice."
Too contrived for its own good and it feels as artificial as a bouquet of plastic pansies.
"Like far too many documentaries today, this formulaic kitsch-fest rests on the strengths of its subject matter to avoid having to present artful or deep filmmaking."
"Sober, respectful, but rather stilted and talky...may be long on factual accuracy, but...it lacks dramatic energy."
"For ""Sahara,"" the problem is that we have the Indiana Jones movies to compare it to, and I'm afraid there's no comparison. It's never more than a likable poseur."
Not one for the ages.
The film is depressingly obvious and mulched with a score which is the musical equivalent of pre-masticated invalid food.
"The dialogue has the flavor of 2014, even as these paramours simply borrow the dating wisdom -- and gender politics -- of their 1980s counterparts."
One of those movies where you have to get popcorn just to throw it at the screen.
"Regardless of its esteemed pedigree of writer Neil Gaiman and director/animator Henry Selick (""The Nightmare Before Christmas"") this creepy gothic kids' movie doesn't approach anything that the Brother Grimm cooked up on a off day."
Forgotten almost as quickly as it's watched.
Walking With the Enemy is one of those cinematic conundrums critics face: encountering a should-be-told story in a should-be-avoided movie.
"'American Pastoral' the novel is a primal scream. ""American Pastoral"" the movie is a whimper."
"My reaction to everything that happens in 50/50 was ""Why don't they just walk out?"" But nobody did, so I did it for them."
Ends up looking more like a motivational self-help video about fixing the mistakes of the past than a genre movie. [Full review in Spanish]
"Unlike the gargoyle I remember, Langella's Nixon exudes a seductive charm and vulnerability. He's the film's chief virtue, and its biggest flaw."
"The mummy may, but the audience shouldn't."
The film cuts too many dramatic corners and skimps on characterization (some of which is replaced with maudlin sentiment).
"""Into the Ashes"" is by no means a terrible film, but still fails to leave a lasting impression."
... A tedious nonsense.
"There's a few laughs to be had along the way and if there's any justice we should see a lot more of the truly talented Will Poulter, but this well-hyped comedy isn't as funny as its well cut trailer would indicate."
"I can't say if this nicely crafted nonsense will sell as a franchise, but I know that I miss the unpretentiousness of the Bourne movies."
"If the point of Encounter is to play games with its audience and keep them guessing, it's a massive failure, largely predictable from plot point to plot point. If the point is a compelling drama, it's also a failure due to its sheer ridiculousness"
"A high-concept situation, and potentially a complex, fascinating study of how family and children shape a life for both good and ill. His life has become a Benetton ad."
"The emotional impact of the story is blunted by underdeveloped characters, a muddled climax, and a frustrating lack of action."
"Credit Shrek 2 for being the rare sequel that more or less equals its predecessor-the first film was garbage, and so is the second."
"Eli's decision is much less about which role model he'll follow. It's much, much more about whether or not he'll be able to kill a bunch of goons..."
Rohmer has somehow created a spy thriller without a single thrill--the entire film consists of heavily overwritten political dialog.
"From Yentl to Yenta: At 70, Streisand still commands the screen with ease and charisma, but this mother-son comedy is so lame and retro that it's embarrassing to watch."
This is forgettable stuff.
"Is Allen just pulling our leg, or is he so detached from modern youth, privileged or not, that he can't write them as anything other than his own fantasies?"
"No serious exploration of the issue of the invasion of privacy of celebrities but a classic exploitation picture -- topical, punchy, occasionally unintentionally laughable and morally dubious."
"This isn’t one of those films that’s so bad it’s good. Instead, it’s so bad it’s boring. It may be the longest one hour and 49 minutes of your life."
"The only thing worse than a movie without an ending, is a ninety-minute endurance test without an ending."
My Father&#8217;s Dragon is another beautifully animated effort from Cartoon Saloon&#44; but the story fails to hit the heights of their previous work&#46;
"Alas, I didn't buy a word of it."
Far too high-and-mighty to truly be moving.
"It’s understandable why so many talented people got together on the film, specifically Messrs. Harbour and Mackie... There’s just so much going on in We Have a Ghost that it might tax a viewer’s credulity, if not his or her patience."
"Stripped-down to a point where it doesn't resemble a movie so much as it does pure, chemical testosterone, ""Undisputed"" is a prison boxing drama that you wish had something more than prison and boxing on its mind."
"This all sounds clever enough but in truth, Mars Attacks! is not as much fun as it should be."
"The shame is that Rosario Dawson gives an earnest, sympathetic, even moving performance as the victimized character. In contrast, none of her castmates seem authentic."
When in Rome is an insipid waste; every ounce of potential has been steadfastly turned away from in order to make a safe little piece of clowning.
The material is indisputably dramatic but it hasn't been shaped or shot with any dynamism
"Because Crossroads is essentially a platform for Spears' fledgling acting efforts, the film struggles with her."
"Essentially a PG-13 version of Alexandre Aja's Piranha 3D with fewer jokes and even less of a point, The Meg is a faceless, lifeless, workmanlike, unimaginative, lowest common denominator-courting, movie-like substance."
"Surgical kidnapping in 3 languages, and out of control mismanaged health care with no possibility of medical malpractice lawsuits in sight. Or more to the point, what in the world is bugging director Tom Six. Hold the insecticide."
A movie that wafts in and out of clarity like a wavering transmission.
"By film's end, the notion of a rational and satisfying climax has hopelessly disappeared in a silly spiral of one-upmanship and a barrage of half-baked revelations that won't make you marvel so much as shrug and forget about them."
The characters and situations here are all stereotypical or undercooked.
"An infuriatingly-offensive, soft-porn primer on how to treat girls as objects who exist at the disposal of men."
"A cold, passionless, underwritten tale of a relationship wrecked by circumstance."
"Even though all the supporting elements of a superior film are here, the actual plot that everything is at the service of is disappointing. The texture of reality and the sheen of fine craft disguise this for a while, but not forever."
"If I'm less than totally enthusiastic about The Pink Panther Strikes Again, maybe it was because I've been over this ground with Clouseau many times before."
There are at least two characters whose stories are more promising than the main character of Handsome Devil.
"There are moments of fun, but this is an otherwise disappointing start to Robert Downey Jr.'s post-MCU career."
More frustrating than the film's inability to impart a full-bodied portrait of its subject ... is a more general directorial ordinariness.
"'The Kitchen' is not a bad movie. It simply lacks the courage of its convictions. Berloff tries to have it both ways - fighting mightily to keep our sympathies vested in Kathy, Ruby and Claire, while darkening their characters."
"Susan Stroman, who directed and choreographed the Broadway show, has shot the movie as if it were the show ..."
"The interminable final act of Tony Scott's heretofore modestly entertaining thriller turns the modulated cool of a Michael Mann film into a brash, loud Viagra ad. This is the great disappointment of the summer so far."
"Despite being entirely unrealistic, this is a mildly entertaining movie thanks to its breezy tone and a cast that seems to be having a good time."
The movie needs Meg Ryan or Jenna Elfman (and a better script).
"If you are looking for a harmless action comedy, you could do worse than this. Just don't expect anything other than a few random laughs thanks to inspired casting."
A film approximately 48 times worse than the original.
"A serviceable picture, but hardly a top-notch vehicle for Washington's remarkable gifts."
"This tale of a philosophical Great Dane who speaks with Owen Wilson's voice is not entirely without merit. Well, actually, it is, but never mind."
"In Clint Eastwood's hands, Richard Jewell becomes a martyr to the director's career-long cause: heroism when it exists in direct opposition to authority."
An embittered writer's movie about the coruscating damage of jealousy and the impossibility of finding nobility in failure
"What's lacking here is the cold-eyed structure of a storyteller and filmmaker, both in the writing and the direction."
"Not the stinker that everyone says it is, but you do have to ignore its flaws in order to be entertained."
"While the heartless Brit caricatures may be an accepted genre staple, the smouldering cultural exchanges between a fiftysomething Oz farmer and a winsome Turkish hotelier push this from old-fashioned melodrama into modern-day mush."
"A convoluted, boring storyline and a way-too-long feature."
"At its most stylish, the picture is worth taking in - the music video vibe overwhelms at times - but then it snaps out of its trance with nothing in particular to say."
No amount of vibrant scenery can distract from the tired melodrama that engulfs the rest of the film.
"The movie's chief purpose seems to be reminding audiences of what they enjoyed in the previous movies, but the best way to enjoy those is to just go watch them again."
It's a movie so foul even the folks at the NAACP Image Awards would have to look the other way.
"If I ever have to watch another Scary Movie film, I'll give up on writing, cinema, and society forever."
"It's an oddly factless piece of historical reenactment, and feels a bit mushy and insubstantial because of it."
"As much as I sat amused (occasionally highly amused) for 136 minutes, I never felt particularly engrossed or even all that thrilled. The stakes were too low."
The movie starts by letting you know that no low-brow subject is off limits. But then there are long stretches of nothing in between the gross-out gags.
Mr. Snyder's blood feast is strictly by the numbers: this second-rater could be the world's most expensive Troma film.
"More Perry than Shange, and all the weaker for it."
Sometimes incredible true stories don't make for incredible films.
About the best thing I can say about Juwanna Mann is that it's not dreadful.
"Benevolent Capitalism: A Love Story. And why bother with pesky facts, when your objective is a feelgood film. Marx once said it's not enough to be right, you have to be convincing. Moore grabs the latter notion, with faulty fact checking for the former."
"For all the noise and thunder early on, Prometheus just runs out of steam, but what a ride until it does."
These Pants are torn and frayed.
"I'm glad I saw Twilight for one reason: It made the phrase jump the shark obsolete, to be potentially replaced with The vampires are playing baseball."
"What screenwriters [Tom] Morris, Elliot Feld and Jaz Kalkat fail to build is dramatic tension: affable, extremely self-involved Levi easily skates around all obstacles."
"It would be nice if [Beck] could rely on the script to get him through, but since it's filled with dialogue like 'Don't go in there,' it can't save the day."
Move along. Nothing to see here.
Its downfall is its clich-riddled and fusty script.
Missiles have the only sensible dialogue in this otherwise technically awesome picture.
"What drives the world of Black Mass is Bulger's enablers, henchmen and virtually faceless rivals whom he stylishly dispatches. It's the human factor that's missing right across the board."
As tiresome an evening at the movies as any humorless drone could ever hope to inflict on an audience.
"Perhaps it's fitting that a movie entitled The Aeronauts should only work when airborne, but we the audience don't have the option of only watching the good part."
When serial killers begin targeting well-connected&#44; burgeoning career women&#44; then perhaps Run Sweetheart Run will be regarded as the urgent feminist commentary it desperately wants to be&#46;
"Oliver Stone doesn't just create trainwrecks. He knocks the train off the rails, sets it on fire, then kills every person onboard. (And takes three hours to do it.)"
"Decent, but innocuous and offering nary a surprise or unexpected plot or character development, this romantic comedy doesn't possess enough of either obligatory element to appeal to anyone beyond diehard aficionados of the genre."
"Blackhat works best when it's suggesting visual connections between people and things, cities and tech."
The Faculty consistently draws attention to its own ill-joined cracks and seams.
"47 Ronin fails to be a good movie out of a fascinating pitch. Even with intensely beautiful distractions, they are not effective enough to disguise the gigantic lumps."
We Are Marshall has little of the bone-crunching sincerity of the recent pigskin rouser Invincible. This one is more like Unconvincing.
"How Do You Know is more Why Should I Care, and I can't honestly say I recommend you rush out to see it."
"...it screams for a coherent, well-told story."
"It's tempting to think of ""Molly's Game"" in poker terms: Sorkin's holding a queen, a king, and at least a couple of aces, but the tell is that he talks too much, and in the end you realize he's bluffing."
"Cruise runs and shouts his way through set pieces, while others mumble mythological explanations, and Ahmanet simply stands around showing off her hieroglyph tattoos."
"""Enzo Avitabile Music Life"" succeeds at conveying one-quarter of its title."
"Bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable. But for the most part, The Weight of Water comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness."
"One of those movies that reaches such ridiculous heights, you hang around just to see how outrageous it'll get."
"...laden with vomit, turd, and genitalia jokes that feel like they were written by a ten-year-old who just heard the word ""nads"" for the first time."
"""Lovelace"" becomes too distracted by industry politics and the cultural context of the film's release to provide more than a snapshot of her life either before or after she stepped in front of a camera."
"The Family that Preys shows grand advances in the filmmaking education of playwright-turned-filmmaker Tyler Perry. It's also his soapiest film yet, an overwrought melodrama of sibling rivalry, infidelity, family business power plays and terminal illness."
To try to present an epic concert like this is little more than an hour and a half - and to then devote even less than an hour of that to the music - seems like a very odd choice.
"...Song One is well intentioned, well-shot and has its musical heart in the right place, but it often feels incredibly familiar, and the more contrived, credulity-straining moments don't help."
We've seen this all before.
"13 Sins tries to demonstrate the potential everyone has to fall down a slippery moral slope, but the missions get so ridiculous and gruesome [...] that it's hard to take the film seriously, even on its heightened terms."
Dot the I is okay-ish until it drops one of those Sixth Sense-style plot twists which negates everything that has gone before it into audiences' laps . . .
The most realistic action scenes caught on film since...The Care Bears Movie.
Kids will love it but adults will squirm. A little squeak from the chipmunks goes a long way.
"""Hell Ride"" is so bad that if I were forced to choose between seeing it again or seeing my worst nightmare version of what ""Wild Hogs 2"" might entail, I am fairly certain that I would select the latter without a moment's hesitation."
"Considering Rob Reiner's output lately, it's tempting to call the film a triumph, if only on the grounds that it's not awful. The problem is that it isn't any good either,"
"Thompson gets the best line in the film. The problem is, the British dame is in it for less than five minutes, bookending with brilliance a sluggish two-hour slog that sinks into stupidity without her."
There's precious little effort made to adapt a Hollywood that is evolving away from the era when bros would be bros and women existed mainly to stand around in tiny bikinis.
"A poorly paced, generic action movie with cheap-looking special effects, only a step or two above the sci-fi fare that goes straight to video."
"Lightly informative, though the film is as humourless and straight as its subject."
"Campbell's film has style for days, if not terribly much behind it: It's an antique book with mostly blank pages."
"The performances are also fun, even if the story is derivative and the special effects look to be photo-shopped at a K-mart."
"The plotting is as gloppy as can be, there are long stretches where not much of anything happens."
"To her credit, Taylor-Johnson proves that graphic images are not needed and this is the first mainstream Hollywood film that successfully shows female pleasure in bondage scenes. Unfortunately, we have to wade through an awful lot that is trite."
Rings is a mediocre horror sequel handicapped by poor writing that will only appeal to die hard fans of the genre and source material.
"Unfortunately, this one is too by-the-numbers and unoriginal to garner a recommendation."
"Yoon drew from her own experience as a Jamaican American married to a Korean American, and Sun feels like a missed opportunity to explore the specificity of that in more detail, and with fewer conventions."
"One might expect something more robust than ""Paris Can Wait"" ultimately brings to the table."
"This new adaptations noteworthy commentary on poignant, timely issues is often eclipsed by predictability, superficial character development and inconsistent pacing."
"If Norah Ephron had better producers around to save her from herself, ""Julie & Julia"" could have been the movie it wants to be--that is a Julia Child biopic with Meryl Streep doing a fantastic job as the television chef that taught America how to cook."
"Even by movie standards, the time-tripping in K & L doesn't work."
A muddy and unappealing revenge flick miscast from top-to-bottom.
"Despite an appealing cast that includes Toni Braxton and Cedric The Entertainer, Kingdom Come won't leave you with a happy feeling -- and it may just leave you feeling surly."
"Clever isn't the same as scary. It's the unexplained, not the over-explained, that tingles the spine."
"Everything about Truth or Dare is paint-by-numbers, and its existence makes one wonder which middle-school-sleepover-game will become the next PG-13 horror movie Perhaps ""spin the bottle""?"
The best thing that can be said about Cursed is that it's scarier than Teen Wolf Too.
"The plot is illogical to the core, which one would have accepted had the film been a sheer roller-coaster ride, leaving you little time to notice the holes in the plot."
"With a bare minimum amount of suspense, and a screenplay that needs too much work for one that has so many long stretches of silence, this film leaves you with too many reasons not to care about it."
"Hong's low-key humor and dry comedy also feel sorely missed here, with a lot of the film amounting to watching characters have rather dull conversations."
"What could have been a delicious hoot about dysfunctional dynamics in a disillusioned workplace merely ends up as a woeful, clunky comedy of errors."
"Well, this is an awful movie.So why did I give it two stars?Because, despite the fact that this script is driven entirely by a lowest-common-denominator approach to getting middle-aged men in the theaters, the movie has two single minutes that are simply"
"Has its smattering of laughs, but the new faces bring fewer dividends than the elemental De Niro/Ben Stiller showdown of the original."
"A production that's both amazing to look at and hard to enjoy, The Banquet contains plenty of visual pleasures, but ties its gloomy story in too many knots to be truly entertaining."
It's more appetizer than meal.
"While the details are meticulous, the attitude is all wrong, trading the simple, unaffected charm that has served the character so well since his introduction... for a snarky and fatuous air that leans hard on winking humor and bland, hackneyed irony."
"It's 2/3's of a decent movie. The reworked ending kills it's momentum and ends it on a very sour, underwhelming note."
"There's a vacancy in The Million Dollar Hotel, and it's between Wim Wenders' ears."
28 Days starts out on the wrong foot by attempting to milk far too many laughs from Gwen's sloppy-drunk behavior.
"Not a film so much as a filmed idea. That could be interesting, but alas it is a very bad idea."
Only the modestly entertaining performances of Strait and Ramsey save this film from complete failure.
"As for the storm itself -- or storms, really -- well, you've seen the trailer, haven't you?"
"In Colombiana, a basic formula is reduced to a few broad strokes: she's skinny, she's lethal, she's desperate."
The film's apparent belief that it's more than a tarted-up action flick is even more ludicrous than the story.
An aggressively empty exercise in excess.
It is far too concerned with fitting into the greater Terminator timeline and ultimately the action suffers because of it.
"A nice-looking movie isn't a good movie. Jumanji focused on story, character development, and a strong sense of imagination while Welcome to the Jungle focused more on gags, clichéd moments, and visual effects."
The movie is as conventional a biopic as Earhart was an unconventional woman.
Wonder Woman 1984 is a rather underwhelming affair. It loses sight of the woman behind the inspiring sense of wonder.
"What is strange about Heaven Is a Playground is how this dynamite material is defused -- how the movie meanders and loses its way, drags to a halt when it should be most exciting, and goes through strange shifts in tone and style."
"Pluto's story is scattershot, though it occasionally resonates."
"Overstuffed and, in its own way, preachy."
Green Book owes some of its likability to Capra and to mediocre imitators that play with a secure and almost always infallible formula. [Full Review in Spanish]
"In any event, as history, Charlie Wilson's War is a travesty."
"Produced by the ridiculously successful Jerry Bruckheimer, ""Prince of Persia' is an effort to create another ""Pirates of the Caribbean""-type franchise. But unlike Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley and Johnny Depp, the leads here have no chemistry."
"In the end, 21 and Over is more exhausting - and exhausted - than funny or wild."
"Monster Hunter [is] vapid, empty spectacle that sands down any potential geopolitical commentary."
"Your Honor, I object. It's not fair. Pierce and Moore are just not equally matched. He acts rings around her."
I think the problem with Ruby Sparks is that it's never really sure what the rules are.
Ghost in the Shell might look like the source material come to life but misses all of the things that made the original so compelling.
"I couldn't help thinking that the standard of writing and characterisation was a little bit broad, and frankly not up to the level of TV dramas such as Skins or Queer As Folk."
"Jeez, I was yearning to leave after less than five minutes watching the spectacularly annoying, thirty-something Molly Shannon flounce around as an adolescent social misfit."
"The filmmakers either needed to lean more into the insanity or more into Jibran and Leilani's relationship, but both are given relatively short shrift."
Art and suffocating tastefulness are taken as such inherent goods in [this film] that they utterly overwhelm the real people whom the film pretends to showcase.
"The back story, with the pursuit of the Apple, is vague and frustrating; the back-and-forth between present and past hampers the film's fluidity; and the characterisation is weak."
"A painfully old-fashioned trick, a game played many times before, by far more thoughtful filmmakers with greater commands of and ideas about their medium."
"Visually fantastic, logically flawed and incredibly dull. Just like your friend's dreams."
"As a study in grief, it's too distracting to make an impact."
"There are laughs, even if you have to suffer for them."
This is the kind of material you expect to find in a Lifetime cable-channel movie.
After Love feels a bit undercooked in its final stretch&#46;&#46;&#46; The resolution following the inevitable confrontation lacks some potency in part because it lands better in concept than in execution&#46;
Emma Thompson and Pierce Brosnan deserve better than this creaky heist-caper comedy from 'Last Chance Harvey' director Joel Hopkins.
"When all is said and done, and Cloverfield plays out, we're left with...'a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.'"
"""The Nut Job"" comes up short compared with a film like ""Ratatouille,"" which, despite its less-than-adorable rodents, won audiences over through appealing voicework and writing."
"Joseph Gordon-Levitt, as a fellow who has suffered serious head trauma, comes up with such a moody Method assemblage of twitches, tics, and guilty Memento mannerisms that he's not much fun to watch."
A benign but forgettable sci-fi diversion.
"Fast and chattery, this New York comedy has a huge ensemble and a plot that feels like it's spiralling out of control from the start."
Watching it was a very cold experience.
"It has potential, but it just falls disappointingly short."
"I guess it's okay, if you like garbage."
"Mindless, dumb fun as Arnie grunts a few one liners and tries to terminate an escaped drug lord who's in a fast car and heading for freedom."
A second-rate sex farce...mostly clunky and vaguely unsavory.
What exactly are the perks of being a wallflower? Chbosky's as short on answers as he is on vowels.
"An Unquiet Grave is poorly written and conceived, despite its interesting premise."
"Marvel's 23rd entry feels not like an epilogue to the main story, but a request for a clean slate; a plea for its audience to forget the failings of its films and characters, and to instead accept their iconography at a distance."
"Disregards the political shifts of Brazil's history by isolating the sprawling narrative from the rest of the nation, so that nothing can distract the director from his finicky composing"
There's always something both depressing and perversely fascinating in watching a bad movie made by a great filmmaker.
The purpose of the entire enterprise seems to demonstrate the superiority of slapstick sadism from 75 years ago to the wan attempts at PG-rated roughhouse today.
"Like most of Chan's other older films, this one's filled with plenty of amazing fight scenes, but also laughably bad English dubbing, mediocre acting at best, and a throwaway script designed only as a sparse skeleton upon which to hang the elaborate fight"
Both underwritten and overwritten and shows every sign of being edited with a food processor.
"Together, Lopez and Anthony have created the kind of wildly miscast and misconceived star couple vehicle that hasn't been seen since. . .well, since the infamous ""Gigli"" and even that film seems more explainable in retrospect than this one."
A film that somehow goes lower than your lowest expectations. [Full review in Spanish]
"There could be quite an active drinking game if viewers took a shot every time someone in the movie says something like, ""Here's how it's going to be"" or ""Here's how it's going to happen."""
"""Dark Phoenix"" does little to squelch the sense that it's about time to put a torch to things and boot -- or more likely, reboot -- ""X-Men"" back into a 21st-century universe."
"Wahlberg loses, and The Gambler craps out."
The thrill of the opening movement gradually ebbs away; much of what remains is unbearably slow and predictable.
"Nothing about ""Mortal Engines"" works. Not the story. Not the aesthetics. Not the performances. Nothing. Just tow this clunker to the junkyard and be done with it."
"As hard as the cast works in turning in solid performances, they fight a losing battle against the largely uninspired story."
American Dreamz isn't mean enough or funny enough.
Mediocre spoof.
Another relentlessly violent rampage with no discernible point whatsoever.
Paul Rudd is the only person who remembers that Ghostbusters is a comedy.
Torque is like a third generation copy of a bad videotape.
"So-so teen romcom sequel has cursing, alcohol, sex."
"It is, simply put, an ode to violence, but violence as imagined by 21st-century Hollywood."
"Home Again is plain vanilla, from start to finish."
David Mamet sets him on the path to righteousness in a collection of contrivances masquerading as a meaningful plot.
"The shift into postmodern mode in the film's final act is too expository and feels like a belated attempt to inflect a bit of spice to an intelligent, if rather dry, drama."
"As good as a couple of its action beats are, Max still suffers from the heartlessness that makes games emotionally inferior to movies. Nobody ever shed a tear over a video-game character's death."
The only thing keeping this often trite melodrama afloat is its dream ensemble.
This is cringe-inducing humor at its most wooden.
A curious letdown.
Watching this movie is like watching Godfrey Cambridge's racial switcheroo in 1970's Watermelon Man -- without the laughs.
"Natali whips up an atmospheric frenzy in kind, but every new addition is a subtraction."
"oso amelitea problimatiko ki an to briskeis poy i tainia afinei shedon oli tin anaptyksi haraktiron sto non-prequel poy den yparhei, einai olotela abastahto i ligi poy krataei, na einai arketa halia oste na eyhesai na min ypirhe episis"
A pathetically worthless horror piece from nearly top to bottom that fails in virtually every genre and subgenre it wanders into.
"An uncomfortable combination of humor and horror, Brothers Grimm is full of flourishes, but lacks Gilliam's absurdist heart."
There are shoot-outs galore and the story trots along but what should be rousing entertainment falls rather flat.
"If Simmba is Rohit Shetty's idea of what justice looks for women, I can only hope that we don't have to sit through a film that is his version of what equality looks like."
Falls far short of creating the mesmerizing menace of its justly celebrated predecessor.
"Bad Santa 2 has to make do with director Mark Waters (Mean Girls), who is both more sentimental and more accepting of broad, panicky comedy."
"Despite the odd sharp observation, somehow J. Edgar comes off like the Max Fischer Players' production of Serpico... [Blu-ray]"
"The lack of action, or even movement...will be a turn off to most [but for the hardcore film buff]."
"It's as though director Hugo Rodríguez and writer Martín Salinas watched every movie ever influenced by a Tarantino movie -- not the real thing, even -- and boiled them into something bland."
"The conclusion transforms at least this part of the film from sappy romance to beautifully authentic meditation on life, death and a family's love for its long-time loyal dog."
The Invasion's lack of thematic coherence points not only to a simplistic view of the world but to the fragmentation one risks when undergoing artistic collaboration within the film industry.
"This horribly ill-conceived project is fake from start to finish, without a moment recognisable as real, and the story is often so badly told as to be laughable."
"If the television show Happy Days ""jumped the shark"" and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull ""nuked the fridge"", then The Fast and Furious Franchise has definitely ""launched the Fiero""."
"A dusty soap opera set in the California desert where evil oilmen fight a crusty farmer, The Devil Has a Name is a real head-scratcher."
"Foxx is a talented performer, and he has a charm about him. But this mix of comedy and action doesn't blend well, and he can't pull it off."
"We started to wonder if ... some unpaid intern had just typed 'Chris Rock,' 'Anthony Hopkins' and 'terrorists' into some Univac-like script machine."
"Kristen Schaal is a pleasing addition as the daughter of Rufus (the late George Carlin from the earlier outings), but ultimately, and underwhelmingly, it's business as usual."
"It's ostensibly about adults, but there's nothing remotely adult about it."
"The Zucker/Abrahams movies were genuinely funny, at least some of the time. But this?"
It's an interesting premise but many of the subplots are rushed.
Parental Content Review
"Cross is the only provider of laughs in this film, which is now just a franchise machine whose purpose is to gouge yet more cash out of the kids who liked the previous two films."
"Aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with Townsend. When she speaks, her creepy Egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music."
Anyone who has ever followed the Project Greenlight television show probably will agree that... the movies all suck... Feast does not turn this around.
"Whatever else you may think of Boll's directorial 'skills,' you can't fault him for inconsistency -- his movies are always atrocious, and Bloodrayne is no exception."
"Derivative, white-bread rom-com about a dumped girl seeking happiness in NYC."
"It's an independent film with a difference, but not as emotionally engaging as you'd really like it to be."
Too much of this dialogue-driven theatrical piece is whispered.
'I want you to do a f*ckin' creative repo on these guys. Irony! I f*ckin' love it.'
"When the same surname keeps appearing during the opening credits, it's usually a bad sign."
"For love of the God, what is wrong with the once-likable Kevin Costner?"
It's a horror film for the casual horror viewer and will most likely not scare the more dedicated genre fans.
The movie's lingering close-ups on yearning faces and heart-to-heart conversations force the fake Millers into real familial longing that's more bogus than the family itself.
"There's much more plot floating around during the sequel, all leading up to a climax at the ""KEN Conference"" that suffers in comparison to Silicon Valley's mockery of the same milieu."
Rob Zombie proves he's a filmmaker to be taken seriously -- or at least not to be considered a total joke -- but he still hasn't figured out how to fashion something more than the sum of his enthusiasms.
"Despite some foreshadowing in the opening scene, the film's change of key in the second half feels like a betrayal."
"Sitting through this 2 hour, four minute gawdawful mess was literally painful."
"A Scottish Harold and Maude, with none of the charm."
"The one thing that comes through this pedestrian, by-the-numbers French biopic of the iconic fashion designer is that the guy was a bit of a bore."
Bangkok Dangerous is bad without lifting a finger toward interesting.
"It's all warm, well-shot, instantly forgettable, and familiar to a fault."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you Exhibit A in the evidence that no more video games, under any conditions, should be made into movies."
"Crossing Over has hurtled into Crash territory, and the smash-up is not a happy collision."
The nicest thing I can say is it reminded me of a very funny scene in another movie.
"This off-the-rails paranoid thriller is so untethered -- not helped by Eckhart's unpredictable, inconsistent performance -- that it's difficult to tell whether it's taking itself seriously."
"It's exhausting, yet emotionally unengaging."
"The lack of an insightful screenplay, or well-drawn characters for Schwarzenegger and McNairy to work with leave Aftermath seeming empty and, frankly, dull."
"One of the longest advertisements for PETA I've seen since 101 Dalmatians. Only, you know, not nearly as much fun."
"Far from committing to something original, Men in Black: International prefers to play it safe. You won't need a neuralyzer to forget this. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Doubt still creaks a bit of the stage, displaying the kind of tidy narrative geometry that's easier to pull off in the acknowledged artifice of live theater than in the feigned intimacy of cinema."
This chapter continually hobbles itself&#44; churning out a hackneyed&#44; exposition-heavy story that&#8217;s a nothing-burger &#8211; a feeble&#44; forgettable and frustrating product&#46;
"What on paper seems to be the perfect marriage of maker and material turns out to be a bust in its finished form, a stagnant movie that revisits the ghosts of Los Angeles noir past without adding much to the canon."
"A modestly entertaining, simplistic, paint-by-the-numbers actioner, fuel-injected with race footage."
"It's hard to believe that someone, somewhere, actually said, 'Hey, let's make a prequel to a movie that had nothing going for it except Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels -- and we'll do it without Jim Carrey or Jeff Daniels!'"
"Big, idiotic, overlong. Gyllenhaal spends a lot of time screaming dialogue. Gonzalez's lipstick never gets smeared. Some stunts are impressive."
"If only Black or Eastwood had an idea of purpose or a definite statement about Hoover (The movie offers ample opportunities), those parts could have made a cohesive whole."
A crime against nature
"...things just move quickly from one person's conflicts to another, with little momentum or feeling of satisfaction."
Speed? Yes. Everything else? No.
"""Swordfish"" just doesn't live up to its protagonist ... but that incredibly complex opening segment and a cool, sleek Travolta almost make it worthwhile"
"What does it all mean? Not very much, I suspect, with the cast sombrely delivering lines about trust and frailty while starring broodily into the middle distance."
"The most frustrating thing about the British prenatal horror movie Kindred is not that it's impersonal, but rather that it's not personal enough."
"Invictus is undone by its own overindulgence, turning a unifying moment of celebration and clarity into an underwhelming piece of cinematic cliché."
Satrapi and scribe Jack Thorne split the process of the biopic in ways which seem interesting but tend to negate the human essence of their subject.
"There is absolutely nothing going on in Beautiful Girls that you haven't seen... [in] any other artistic endeavor in which untethered young men and women, bound by geography and fortified by beer, shamble their way toward overdue maturity."
"It is a strange, empty and pointless exercise that lets down some talented actors and a witty script."
"The result is predictably, frustratingly bloated and meandering, even as the short's charms remain largely intact."
"Tom Hooper directs every scene and composes every shot in this bloated, reactionary musical as if he were trying to express a new idea every time any actor moves a fraction of an inch."
"Diesel already has one blockbuster franchise built on explosions, nonsensical plotting and makeshift families; asking for another one is really pushing his luck."
"The murders themselves, apparently revenge for the robbery of a high-roller, were indeed messy. But they don't hold a candle to the disarray that is director and co-writer James Cox's film."
"Second City alum Nia Vardalos stars in this ethnic comedy, which she also wrote -- an ambitious way to break into a leading role; too bad the results are insubstantial."
Another global hot spot generating fossil fuels? I thought Bollywood comedies had happy endings.
"It's a very tony fantasy of class oppression and fascist medical exploitation (themes that may speak louder in England), but it's a lyrically inert movie."
"The lightweight story eventually runs out of gas and stops, but it provides little to take away other than some fleeting humor."
"Unfocused, dry and boring. It's a squandered opportunity to extensively and compellingly tackle provocative political, social and moral issues plaguing America."
What we end up with here is a tonally confused film with jokes that mostly miss and some good performances from the leads.
"It would be overly polite to call this a pale shadow of the tone-shifting Coen brothers farces from which Nelson - who costarred in O Brother, Where Art Thou? - is taking his cues."
It's okay to walk away from You Should Have Left.

"In the end, ""Kong"" lands with a resounding thud."
"There's never really a point at which Blackbird becomes the engrossing, emotional drama one might've anticipated..."
"Strip away the POV angle, and what's left is basically the awful Hitman: Agent 47. It's an all-hype-no-hope endeavor that grows ever more flaccid by the minute."
Frankenheimer's film was prophetic of the Age of Assassinations. Demme's is a warmed-over casserole of anxiety.
In a universe with 20&#43; films&#44; one of them has to be the worst&#44; and Quantamania is a strong contender for that inauspicious title&#44; lacking any emotional mooring or reason to care whatsoever
Five Minutes of Heaven is actually 75 minutes worth of buildup to an ending that's much more fizzle than sizzle.
"As a visual experience, many of the animated sequences are beautiful. But, without the focus of a traditional screenplay, the story drags a bit and even feels tedious."
"It's a mess, though one inevitably worth seeing by curious readers or fans of the cast who just won't be deterred."
Surface gloss is what you get in this caper-romance.
So thoroughly sanitized that it's essentially wiped of personality.
"If you're looking for a sci-fi family lark, you might want to roll the dice on Zathura."
"With an often ropey script, an insufferable key character and more than one moment when I wanted to scream, ""Just get together already!"" this love letter rather gets lost in the post."
What was the point in Ewan McGregor doing an American accent? A well known Scottish voice imitating a generic American? Just get Frankie Muniz and save the money.
A middling showcase for rising star Aubrey Plaza.
"In the end, it's just a tale of passable interest and questionable authenticity."
Prey swaggers with attitude but can't help slipping on the suds.
"[Williams] has played against type before, but his presence feels like epic miscasting in this underwritten dramedy ..."
"This documentary itself is a whirlwind of deceit, switching tenses at will, as if to legitimize Albert's particular delusions, still enjoying her game and the cultural myths to which liberals are susceptible."
"Kids might be entertained by Flora & Ulysses, but I was not impressed, no matter how far the squirrel can fly."
A forgettable addition to the McKay canon.
"Here is a fatuous film about DJ-ing and clubbing in Los Angeles, whose tired music-video cliches and Entourage-style bro-love would be wearisome at the best of times."
Which makes it all the more frustrating that Profile reduces this interesting premise to its most lurid elements.
"I have seen many stupid movies in my life. But [this] would still count among the stupidest, had I seen twice a many movies in half again as many genres."
"Getting off on the violence and making your characters jaunty in this context looks a lot like buying into the same dumb mythology it's your duty as a filmmaker to debunk. Who was the creative consultant on this movie, Barbara Windsor?"
About as enjoyable as a bad trip.
"... as much as I enjoy seeing another living dead flick, some of his earlier magic seems to have faded into this flawed and slightly uneven film.."
"Along comes Marlon Wayans to do in A Haunted House what he once did in Scary Movie. And do it much, much worse."
Blood splashes everywhere and soaks the audience.

Playmobil: The Movie will likely bore anyone who has reached double digits in age.
Ready Player One won't be remembered as Spielberg's worst film but it's not his best either. It's a purgatory state of a film that understands the appeal of the book but fails to convey those aspects in a satisfactory manner.
"The sex? It eventually arrives in a rapid-fire montage of multiple positions that’s supposed to be daring and audacious but is oddly reminiscent of the absurdist puppet bonking in Team America: World Police. Like the entire film, it means well but ..."
This mediocre feature-length sitcom is just another unnecessary remake of a movie that wasn't particularly good in the first place.
"Zahler only really grips you, alas, with his trademark ferocious displays of violence, which felt like a logical endgame in ""Bone Tomahawk"" and ""Brawl in Cell Block 99,"" but too often smack here of pointless sadism."
the Hollywood melodrama is grating enough that it may be worth skipping altogether.
"Even by the low standards of formulaic sports comedies, this one comes up short."
Kaluuya is clinically depressed and his sister is annoying&#46; Peele fails to bring to the UFO genre a satisfying story&#46; A ridiculous ending&#46;
Computer-animated ugliness
The title mainly leaves one wondering when Sandler will chose to finally grow up and stop starring in this ongoing series of terrible comedies.
"Plopping a 45-year-old actress... into a role clearly intended for, at best, a 23-year-old is a bizarre way to deal with the role shortage [for older women]."
"Tonally disastrous, the movie attempts to depict gruesome violence as serious one moment and hysterically entertaining the next."
"The main issue with ""Pay The Ghost,"" is that it does absolutely nothing new - let alone muster up a reason for its own existence."
A warning light came on in my head when I noticed that Cars has more credited screenwriters (six) than many cars have pistons (four).
"The synopsis promises to put the Wolverine, a blue-collar superhero, into an appropriately realistic criminal environment, but in practice it all adds up to Wolverine fighting the usual big robot in a volcano-sized laboratory."
"This sharp-toothed shark needed freedom, free rein for his murderous desires, however, he could not get out of the fish tank. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"This is a movie with few secrets or surprises, however much it tries to warm hearts or sell eccentricity and idealism."
It was hard to stomach.
The whole never quite registers as forcefully as individual pieces.

"It's either too serious or too much of caricature to ever come together and have any poignancy, which really is required."
"With antics too violent for empowering 'tweens and too pedestrian for adult audiences, trying to please both satisfies neither."
"Cocktail starts off headily enough, and bubbles along till half time; post that, the sips get diluted, and the swallows take much longer."
Goes overboard with the perky quirkiness.
"The initial Hitchcockian tension soon slackens into slop, with a dash of lukewarm eroticism."
Hill seems so averse to calling attention to the struggles of polyamory that the characters shy away from any real conflict.
"Hall Pass teeters on the brink, and just about manages to stay in the rink."
"This is not just a bad film, it is a patently offensive one"
"It stars Kristin Scott Thomas, in one of those French roles she usually excels at. But the movie is a mess."
"Concluding on a fittingly less-than-happy note, the promising but uneven film knows what it wants to say, if not, ultimately, exactly how to say it."
"You ought to provide the audience with someone to root for, and this lumbering screenplay offers nothing but lamebrains..."
"Critters Attack! might entertain the biggest B-movie horror fans, but with a script this vapid, what's the point?"
"Reprise is an ordinary tale of post-adolescent angst that would benefit from a cleaner plot line, clearer characterizations and more intriguing situations."
It's no longer clear whether the filmmaker got sidetracked and fell in love or the documentary is simply the byproduct of some home movies filmed under extraordinary circumstances.
"Holidate distinguishes itself only through its reliance on boorish slapstick, exaggeration and vulgarity."
"One laugh -- Vampires, stuffed in their coffins on a horse-drawn wagon, whining to the driver -- ""Are ve DERE yet?"""
"Despite its arresting visual style, its wave after wave of creative and hypnotic images, The Pillow Book, as its name hints, slowly but inexorably leads to sleep."
"[It] disappoints because it should have been much better. Instead of a comic thriller with some depth, it is as lightweight as a soap bubble, and just as likely to pop."
Craven has produced a poor carbon copy of his own New Nightmare.
"One of Minnellli's weakest (or is it modest?) serio comedies, dealing with the adjustment problems of a recent widower (Glenn Ford) and his young son (played by child actor-future director Ron Howard)."
"Note to struggling actors everywhere: if you think winning an Academy Award will make your career spring to life, look at the career of Cuba Gooding Jr."
"The movie is almost a lot of fun, were it not for the fact that Anderson lacks a knack for clarity and lightness; he shakes the camera too much and cuts so fast that the race becomes a blur."
It's impossible not to come out wishing it were better.
Frustratingly superficial.
"Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters has the hypnotic allure of a candy-coated house but in reality, it's a diabetic coma."
"While it's nice to watch a movie that hasn't been focus-grouped into tedium, Yu's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold."
Anyone shopping by the ton for melodrama is well advised to browse the ample display on view in this cinematic square.
"Where in the World Is Osama bin Laden? jokes about Spurlock capturing the bounty on Osama's head, or making the world safe for his child-to-be, but it's really about the narcissistic filmmaker and his enablers the Weinsteins making a few bucks."
What lies beneath? Too much that adds up to too little.
"Egoyan's screenplay, based on a convoluted novel by Rupert Holmes, never achieves any kind of dramatic credibility."
"The Bond films never make sense, but some of the plot twists here are ludicrous even by the usual standards."
"There are the raw materials for a piercing American tragedy, detailing the corrosive hubris of a certain type of moneyed class, but a far more studied and icier eye is needed."
"The movie moves at such an agonizingly stately pace that by the end, side effects be damned, Henry's time-traveling gene starts to look mighty appealing."
More a string of rousing speeches than a narrative.
"Vin Diesel is better than the material, but, no matter how hard he tries, he can't rise above the puerile screenplay."
"Could have been so much more if not for the relentless focus on Wolverine and Magneto. While their performances were good, just sucked the life out of the film. Felt like a retread of the far superior X-Men: First Class."
"French director Benoit Jacquot is fascinated by American crime drama, but pays homage to the form by removing most of the drama and nearly all the crime."
"It's got vision and atmosphere to burn, yet at the same time feels strangely hollow and incomplete."
"fatally overlong, filled with haphazard history lessons and half-drawn conclusions, never jelling into a cohesive film or possessing the energy to move its great bulk forward."
"The much ballyhooed return of Greengrass and Damon has surprisingly warranted a disappointing sequel, an unnecessary chapter that feels written at gunpoint, and the story's curiously transparent about this"
"It's really hard to believe that any of this is meant to be taken seriously, not for a split second, yet there is Garner, stalking morosely about as if she's doing Eugene O'Neill instead of a dopey fantasy actioner."
"Individual scenes come across as amusing, but Guest loses comic momentum when he shifts between the shooting of the lachrymose Home for Purim and the segments lampooning entertainment media."
"A loosely patched-together mishmash of action film cliches, it squanders strong lead performances in an aimless morass."
"Begins with an engaging setup but gradually lapses into a messy web of cloak-and-dagger contrivance, implausible action, silly plot twists and dumb dialogue."
"The frights, the scares, they just weren't there."
"It's hard to figure out where to begin with Under the Stadium Lights, a West Texas high school football biopic that fails at everything"
"If his two leads are adequate to the slick mechanisms of a formulaic thriller, neither they nor Don Roos' script (based on the novel by John Lutz) offer any original insights into insatiable emotional dependence."
"What is the point, other than to show up the director's technical skill at presenting mutilation?"
"All the Money in the World is a poor movie, and all it needed was a bad main performance to sink it. As Getty's ex-CIA security chief, Chase, Mark Wahlberg does the trick."
"[An] inept, studiously naive, childishly sanctimonious phantasmagoria ""inspired"" by the Beatles' great album."
A one-sided soapbox for Harrelson's eco-friendly prattle.
"Trippy in one sense but trite in another...contains some genuinely gonzo eye-candy, but the weirdly imaginative images are wedded to a tired script."
"Rated PG, according to the MPAA, for fantasy violence and 'a smoking caterpillar.' The Jefferson Airplane would be proud; Lewis Carroll devotees, however, may be less than enthusiastic..."
The most overrated movie of the year.
"Where, in short, is this film's personality, or even the characters' personalities, for that matter?"
"Handsome, young and generally good-looking Karl Glusman and Aomi Muyock have limited interpretive skills, suggesting that Gaspar Noah was only interested in jerking himself off. [Full Review in Spanish]"
The real problem with 21 and Over is that it swipes most of its material from better movies.
Emphatically overblown. Slightly underwhelming. Intermittently exciting. Consistently confusing.
It's a perfectly lame movie that speaks intriguingly to the way we live now.
If I Spy were funny (enough) or exciting (enough) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it's trying to reap from the moviegoing public.
"Aside from a couple solid action sequences, this bloated epic is exhausting instead of exciting and sentimental but not sad."
"Intriguing as a flawed experiment in animation, ""nine dollars ninety-nine"" suffers from a lack of thematic continuity that leaves the audience wanting both more and less--more story and less metaphor."
"What sad times we live in when a contemporary knockoff of Roman Holiday stars, in the place of the immortal Audrey Hepburn... Mandy Moore."
"there are characters about whom we never care, incidents which never grip, and only the occasional moments of creative grand guignol ever raise the viewer's pulse."
"Against the Ropes ... is ""inspired"" by Kallen's life but ultimately has as much to do with her story as Schindler's List did with the War of 1812."
No energy!
"A beautiful location, a potentially tender romance, and a talented cast are unfortunately not enough to overlook the film's rocky execution."
"Birds of Prey is so schizophrenic in terms of look and style and tone, it won't be changing Martin Scorsese's mind about comic book movies any time soon."
Raimi does imprint his signature on the MCU in terms of aesthetic and tone&#46; The need to stay attentive to accessibility and sustain continuity stops him from taking bigger narrative swings however&#46;
"This film, directed by Susanna Fogel, is a crass and vulgar spy caper with few admirable qualities, aside from the competent pairing of Kunis and McKinnon and one terrific laugh about the overwrought menu of a certain American restaurant chain."
Office politics take a deadly turn in French thriller.
"Producer Judd Apatow has gone from comedy gourmand to McDonald-izing in four years. And when in doubt, director Harold Ramis makes Jack Black eat his own feces and Michael Cera pee in his own mouth. Yes, this is at the level of YouTube monkey comedy."
"Actors have bills to pay too, and who knows, maybe Transylvania is nice in the summer."
"There is nothing here to justify a sequel, other than the merchandising revenue. What they have given us is a limp, over-stuffed film that lacks class."
Snatched amuses because of who's delivering the jokes rather than what the jokes are. It isn't a Trainwreck by any means.
The action is so badly edited and darkly lit that it's hard to tell what's happening.
Onward begins with an intriguing premise but doesn't come close to fully fleshing out the possibilities.
A glibbest of royalty themed romantic comedies... Standard teenage wish-fulfillment slop.
"If there's any obsession or intensity in this movie, it belongs to Jade's father - a detail that throws the movie somewhat off kilter."
"A routine, genial sports movie."
The film fizzles out in the end.
It's a mid-range thriller with some absolutely terrific performances.
1.5
"The narrative automobile lurches from fifth gear to first, then swerves into a white picket fence and bursts into flames."
"Azumi (based on a 25-part manga series) has eye-popping battle sequences, but the story is superficial at best."
Much of the rest that goes on in Zhou Yu's Train feels needlessly overinflated.
Some people find white noise soothing and listen to it to help them sleep&#46; Others find it annoying&#46; And that pretty much sums up White Noise&#46;
"It's a total cinematic dead zone, deeply troubled from the get-go."
"You'll likely be looking for distractions to help make the time pass quicker. The obvious choice would be to keep count of all the hackneyed catch phrases, though I found tallying the repeated shots of exposed butt-cracks to be more fruitful."
"Unfortunately, the story of Ra'up McGee's pigheaded perseverance is a better story than the one he filmed."
"Smug and dumb as they come, it's a series of eruptive gross-out sketches tenuously linked by a romance plot."
"Far less would have been much more, though the geriatric protagonist's salty sexual wit and impulse to share a joint with a passing stranger, spice up the often dreary chronological procession of family episodes."
"It's the typical, from-the-archives, scrapbook approach that makes Corman's World the safe bet that it is."
"Trier condenses a dark comedy with a dramatic register, in a few minimally interesting episodes, but which almost always remains on the surface of eclecticism when it questions the established roles of femininity. Full review in Spanish"
A phoned-in sex comedy that arrives with all the charm and warmth of a wrong number
"Katherine grows less plausible, and her motivations seem murkier as her cruelty escalates. She stars out as an avenging angel and then devolves into almost campy serial-killer criminality, the mixed tones leaving us insufficiently moved."
"Beyond the eye candy represented by the stars and their sun-soaked surroundings, there's little else that's memorable about this disposable tissue of a movie."
"Without strong guidance, the self-conscious lines make the characters sound like, well, characters rather than actual human beings."
"This being the middle part of a planned trilogy, Halloween Kills truly suffers because it has no cohesive beginning and no proper ending."
A markedly generic teen sex comedy.
"Despite the restrained tone, the film really is this schematic and it gets less and less interesting the more it uncovers."
The latest horror retread adapted from the portfolio of kitsch king William Castle boasts exactly one great performance. Too bad it's by a house.
One big chill. The only thing that moves with any purpose in this picture is the weather.
"Sitting through this movie, it's hard to imagine there was time when the release of a new Woody Allen film was exciting."
Gemma Arterton is sensational in an otherwise by-the-book melodrama.
"A predictable compendium of Fox News clips on one side and peasants glad-handing their leaders on the other, the docu offers little genuine information and no investigative research, adopting a style even more polemical than Stone's earlier docs"
"Bloody, violent, sexually explicit. Mature teens+."
"A lot of people get shot and many punches are thrown, but there are zero memorable setpieces."
"Kormkur could have removed some wackiness and made a gritty action movie or toned down the viciousness and played this off for comedy, but as it is, 2 Guns is neither fish nor fowl."
"It's a cute enough diversion, but it doesn't really amount to much more than Saturday morning cartoons."
"For a movie packed with religious symbols The Omen has little understanding of religion. It arrives at spirituality backwards: The devil is real, so you better believe in God."
"If characters are totally self-absorbed and don't care for each other, it's hard for an audience to form an emotional connection with them or care about their relationships."
"While not packing the same punch as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the sixth film is a tenuously sufficient end to The Hobbit trilogy that never really found its footing."
"Sadly, Lyne's analysis of the genre's tropes isn't always insightful..."
"There's talent here, and you keep waiting for somebody to do something interesting with all that money, but after that colorful bank robbery opening, it's all downhill."
...a lamentably misguided piece of work...
"Its raw, gritty approach feels like an effort from the filmmakers, but it's mostly work for the audience to endure."
The Lone Ranger is a weird mixture of daffy slapstick and deadly seriousness.
"The foolhardy Spierigs spend so much time setting up Daybreakers for a sequel, or possibly a franchise, that they leave the movie itself mostly in disarray."
"Gibson is still seeking life amid death, but the balance is off."
"A surprisingly boring throwback to '80s fantasy, with a disgusting amount of potty humor, violence and foul language tossed in to generate the shallowest of laughs."
The writing in this film is honestly embarassing.
Unadulterated poppycock.
"Fasten your seat belts before takeoff, because Non-Stop is a bumpy ride."
This movie is simply a joyless exercise in reasserting that just because you recognize your movie kind of sucks does not&#44; unfortunately&#44; stop it from sucking&#46;
"Luketic's dunderheaded, would-be caper is a morality tale where the only moral at stake is the dullard-hero's thoughtless entitlement"
"The worst flaw however is not this risible retake on history or legend but the lack of momentum. ""The Highwaymen"" dawdles. Handsomely mounted, it depicts not a pulse-quickening chase but a slow, pokey crawl."
"There is, needless to say, an overall disconnect between every facet of the story and every other."
This handsome looking film feels old-fashioned and stodgy.
Bitter Feast could have packed a satirical punch.
"What Liberté also illustrates, only too well, is how something that might once have been daring can now feel de rigueur."
An Italian comedy so slight it practically evaporates...
"This feels derivative almost to the point of distraction. And while its try-and-try-again exchanges can be pretty funny, the film feels as if it's laboring to flesh out even the under-90-minute running time."
"This is, essentially, a very long outtakes reel."
"Harebrained, patronizing and regressive."
"Unsure what it wants to say, Kick-Ass 2 is a forgettable action flick with just an occasional splattering of humour."
Imagine a Saw film with a slower pace and more pretentious ambitions.
"There's not much praise to find-not in the substance, nor the ambition, nor the writing, nor the cast."
It's bafflingly shallow
"In a film brimming with ideas, its execution falls somewhat flat. Despite good casting, the acting never lives up to the script, which itself is flawed by self-imposed structural limitations."
"The International isn't pitching itself at Jack Ryan territory, but weirdly, at The Da Vinci Code."
"There is no denying the boldness of Persepolis, both in design and in moral complaint, but there must surely be moments, in Marjane's life as in ours, that cry out for cross-hatching and the grown-up grayness of doubt."
One can only hope that Daniel Stern got paid per humiliaiton.
More cable fare from Hilary Duff...
"Whatever else happens in this movie, the woman who fucks a car is most audacious, most incomprehensible and the most deeply banal emblem, the limit of men's imaginations."
"[A] simple-minded, cheaply sentimental and unrelievedly lugubrious movie."
"The prolific director mixes up his usual mayhem-based routine by marrying genre action with issues of inherited trauma and the marginalization of native peoples - unfortunately, to only moderate effect."
"I found myself genuinely admiring the skill both behind and before the camera, while simultaneously searching for a blowtorch so I could destroy the negative."
A sexual metaphor about penises and a scene where a character is eaten by a creature and escapes death by exiting its anus is so inappropriate that the MPAA must have been asleep when they rated this G.
The most interesting part of watching this movie is trying to decide if the main character deserves to live or die.
"Clumsy, campy and kitsch, but also deadeningly dull for long stretches..."
"Stand back from this fable and examine it for logic, and you see how nonsensical it is."
"Meyjes focuses too much on Max when he should be filling the screen with this tortured, dull artist and monster-in-the- making."
So utterly broken at a conceptual level that a truly good film was completely out of the question.
"It really, really feels like the 11th exhausting film in the unstoppable ring cycle of movies based on the Avengers comic-book heroes -- a vast and increasingly dull series of blockbusters planned out, terrifyingly, as far ahead as 2019."
"I know, you couldn't make it up. But someone did."
"These movies were never what you'd call clever, but was Rambo himself always this dumb?"
A movie as generic and forgettable as the sofa-size art on its characters' walls.
"You're mostly left with facts, dates and iconic poses."
"The ""me"" generation discarded sexual norms when it suited them, and Cronenberg offers a variety of punishments for their hypocrisy."
"There's precious little of the wonder and charm of the original Stars Wars films in this big, loud, and mostly empty spectacle."
The kind of movie you watch for five minutes at a museum and walk away. Ross Geller would love it.
"It's not exciting or scary or comically bad. It is a shrug, nodding that it's time for horror heroes to put the cameras down and get back to running downs paths truly unknown."
"In the midst of this nifty picture-making, one searches in vain for the big picture."
Not nearly as good as Britney Spears' cheese-fest Crossroads...
An unfocused but stylish old-fashioned Warner brothers gangster film.
"If you must know the dark secret ""Silent House"" holds then prepare for a journey that may not pay off in the end."
"While it's far from bad, it also falls far short of the icy frissons produced by the original."
"Adapted from the best-selling novel by Cornelia Funke, this makes a splashy fuss about ""the magic of books"", and yet undermines our imaginative instincts by monstering the screen with special effects."
"There are a few funny ideas, but overall it's silly, schmaltzy and sentimental, as father and daughter take a road trip and discover love, trust and letting go are paramount to their relationship"
"Overall, The Bourne Legacy is mostly disappointing, poorly edited and it seems have buckled underneath with the expectations from the original films, which weighed heavily on its shoulders."
"What could have been a solid, noirish thriller is bogged down by excessive incidents."
"... for all the voices brought in to the project there's not much variety of style or story or even neighborhood, and very little effort to explore the variety of cultures..."
"By no means is Breaking In a good movie, but it's a fun version of a bad one if only in its refusal to waste any of your time on illusions of grandeur."
"Hard-sell and impersonal, the second Angels outing may be full throttle, but it's running on an empty tank."
"The effects may look amazing, but none of the wit has carried over."
I doubt the film makers bothered consulting anyone Armenian or Turkish before finishing this very Hollywood take on a man-made disaster.
A film that uses the comfort of the predictable to make horror palatable to a wider audience.
It seems only moments ago that Star Wars was the biggest thing on the planet. Now it's suitable only for Saturday afternoons on the Cartoon Network.
...ultimately suffers from a middling midsection that's been suffused with pointless digressions and melodramatic crises...
Totally fumbles the fanboy excitement it generated when Willis's David Dunn turned and looked at the camera at the end of Split.
"Simply put, Monkeybone is to comedy what Battlefield Earth was to science fiction."
"The boredom the cast endures sitting around in isolation begins to spread to the viewer, overcoming the over-the-top efforts of Leslie Mann, David Duchovny, Keegan-Michael Key, Pedro Pascal, Iris Apatow and many, many celebrity cameos."
"Velvet Buzzsaw never reconciles its moods, mixing its outré humour and satisfyingly nasty wish fulfillment with an inelegant grasp of horror."
"Has all the hallmarks of a straight-to-DVD project - inferior plot, dull writing, cheap drawing - perhaps because it was intended for the bargain bin at Target, Walmart, and Costco."
"Alas, it's a noisy, cliche-ridden, incomprehensible mess."
"More like a pilot for a TV series along the lines of Southland, an underrated series also about L.A. cops. Indeed, this film is open-ended enough to be exactly that."
"It leaves the viewer to grope their way through confused plotting, kludgy exposition, and half-baked characterization."
"Everything about Erased feels generic, from the dialogue to the plot twists to the action sequences."
"Following many detours, there's little gas left by the time we arrive at the all-too-convenient conclusion."
"The problem here is not the material, it's what Finnigan does - or doesn't - do with it."
The big-screen Scooby makes the silly original cartoon seem smart and well-crafted in comparison.
"A creaky, below-par Brit heist caper that belongs in a dusty vault itself."
"Stone jazzes up the dry proceedings with fancy filmic footwork, but even he is no match for derivatives."
What we&apos;re left with is a shallowly dug exploration of murder and mayhem&#46;&#46;&#46;as if Stranger Danger and Stephen King have taught us nothing but mundane homage&#46; 
"My Spy is silly, it's unoriginal, it's tired, but it's a great vehicle for Bautista to show off his leading man chops."
"It's a truly audacious and bizarre work, and I'd (..) be (...) glad that it exists if it weren't such a (...) slog to watch."
It's a promising premise that soon gets stuck in a cul-de-sac.
"This film by Nick Doob and Chris Hegedus forces us to make some decisions about him. For myself, I find him generally gross, in person and in manner."
"De Niro's casting as the creature is distracting. Although he works hard to suggest a misunderstood loner, we can never forget that it's De Niro under all that latex."
"This underdeveloped tale set on an island in Northern Ontario's Georgian Bay fails to build the intrigue or tension required for a thriller, and falls short as a character-driven drama as well."
"Sometimes all the brooding over actors and motifs from past films makes you feel as if Scorsese is engaged in a conscience-stricken meditation on his career. At other times, you wonder what happened to his famed momentum."
"It's no polemic, but neither is it as character-driven as it aims to be."
Robert De Niro brandishes an epic white pompadour that looks like a prank on eternal producer Robert Evans.
A failed film.
Essentially a soapy family drama set against the backdrop of an apocalyptic catastrophe [that] delivers more suds than thrills.
"“Luck” is a terrible idea for a movie, executed poorly, and by someone who used to know better. The best thing I can say about the finished product is that, unlike most forms of bad luck, this one is wonderfully easy to avoid altogether."
"Between the lack of atmosphere, underdeveloped characters and questionable visuals, Morbius just doesnt know how to hold its audiences attention."
The technical explanations are impossibly difficult for a lay person to follow (screenwriter Tom Stoppard probably understood it all and forgot he had to write for the rest of us).
"It's a colourful, spry enough ride, but it doesn't exactly reinvent the wheel."
...it's like being trapped in a dentist's office with nothing to read but an old issue of Vogue.
The attention shifts from individual character detail and psychological chess matches to outlandish developments and ludicrous resolutions.
Escape Plan reeks with a lackadaisical ennui that makes it difficult to truly enjoy.
"Upsides to social media get pushed aside without bigger-picture relevance, and the film gets into talking about social media influence on democracy late in the game."
"The most intrigue and interest Serving Sara can or will generate revolves around Perry's real life rehab stint, leaving one to wonder which scenes were shot before and after..."
Dry and obvious cult thriller that starts out ugly and then just gets more and more confused.
"So yes, the whos, whats, whys, wheres, whens and hows will assault you non-stop until you give up and go with the flow. Unfortunately, there is nothing to feel."
"""Ride or die, remember?"" Er, not really, no. More like ""Yawn and forget"", as Nabokov once recommended. Only 13-year-old boys and Jeremy Clarkson could possibly enjoy this."
"...replete with crude language, vomit, prolific drug use, infidelity, and generally low class manners and morals, all Apatow staples...f-bombs and vomit are not humor."
"What emerges is desperate -- and occasionally offensive -- salaciousness merged with corny, predictable jokes."
"The story's genial unpretentiousness has been darkened and weighed down, and what's left is less than prime."
"Haggis [has] padded the film out with more action, but every extra minute makes the film an extra bit implausible."
"This movie plays like an episode of ""Gilligan's Island"" done as straight as an episode of ""Lost."""
"It doesn't really know what it is. In trying to offer a little bit of everything, it instead amounts to a lot of nothing."
"Daft, plain daft. With a few daft but spectacular stunts."
The formula is too contrived and the chemistry not enough for any genuine sparks to fly
"A summer movie spectacle you'll sit through and by the time you leave the parking lot, you'll be hard pressed to think of anything you liked about it."
Strictly a kids' movie.
"Whom is this movie for, really? It's too tame for the whooping crowds of women who made hits of the Sex and the City movies and Bridesmaids. And for sure it isn't for parents with kids."
Ultimately&#44; the movie is an impotent howl into the wind&#46;
"Though the devious wit of the original remains, it is obscured by too many classic-rock interludes (courtesy of Led Zeppelin, Heart and Paul McCartney) and nudging pop-culture references that seem by now just part of the formula."
A cheap-looking quickie feature...the wasted talent on display somehow makes it all more painful.
"""F9"" is rubbish. But fans want its variety of rubbish."
This setup &#46;&#46;&#46; is a bit of a stretch&#46;&#46;&#46;
Bereft of the more richly textured sentiments of Tornatore's Cinema Paradiso.
This is a gloomy story of a disturbed person.
"The closer he gets to the sun, the more Boyle loses his nerve, reducing a tense, unpredictable thriller to a needlessly bloody, pseudo-spiritual mess."
"While the visuals are extraordinary and the wry humour is welcome, what's missing is a coherent story with light and shade"
"[A] shallowness in thematic execution is thus difficult to ignore despite great performances, impeccable production value, and memorable cinematography."
"The film is meant to be simple and charming. Unfortunately, it's simple and boring."
"""Edge of Tomorrow"" has neither an edge nor a vision of tomorrow that matters today."
"A two-hour movie actually needs more plot now. It needs to implode, like a black hole. I'm sorry to report that this one fizzles out."
"While the set-up may hold some initial promise, Willow Creek is absent of Goldthwaite's usual wit and cutting commentary."
"There's nothing wrong with a serious-minded film, of course, even one as seemingly joyless as this one, but despite the pedigree of its leads, and the progressive subject matter, it never rises above the gray dampness of its climate."
Mordant young adults might enjoy its maudlin wallow.
"Reacher has no personality. He has no interests. He has no one-liners that land. He is, frankly, just a handsome, dull guy who happens to be adept at knocking people out."
"Fiennes and, as Argos' senior solider, Mads Mikkelson, afford some juicy fun, but Worthington projects the charisma of the young Russell Crowe's lighting double."
"It has its moments, but the end results is unremarkable. That said, Costner and Harrelson are solid. [Full review in Spanish]"
"If you're going to watch Cold Case Hammerskjold, watch it with a grain of salt."
"Solo, like the Falcon in Empire, tends to sputter just when it should leap into hyperdrive."
"Snitch wants to be Breaking Bad. When the camera's on Johnson, it's just bad."
A schmaltz opera that indulges Robin Williams' most melancholy tics and themes.
"Fiennes and Thurman look fine in the familiar outfits, but aren't very good at banter, adventure or romance."
"A decently clever movie that loses confidence in itself the moment it most needs it. As a result, it knocks down the house of cards it had, heretofore, adequately stacked."
"A self-indulgent comedy catchall, one that's saddled with an irony for a title; that is, for a film about the value of identity, Identity Thief doesn't have a clue about what it wants to be."
It's far-from-enthralling.
"[D]isappointingly unengaging... [F]eels sadly quaint from our perspective today, half a century into the journo-zombie infopocalypse..."

Millions were spent to acquire two Hollywood heavyweights so they can: Exchange witless banter. 
...Assassin's Creed makes Warcraft looks like an Oscar-winner. It takes itself entirely too seriously and abandons everything that players loved about the game series.
The film is impossible to take seriously as a commemoration of Moultrie's life or Allen's prolific status because of its plethora of contrivances.
A work whose visual assurance is undercut by a script that's sometimes as ludicrous as it is ambitious.
A-by-the-numbers action film retrofitted as a sci-fi work of art.
"For the most part, pic is about as engaging as what's found on Saturday morning TV."
As a police thriller&#44; it has a few moments of Hitchcockian suspense that twistily examine platitudes of obsession&#44; guilt&#44; and the aftermath of domestic violence&#44; but it loses the intrigue effect in a somewhat uneven second half&#46; &#91;Full review in Spanish&#93;
"It all more or less takes place in a high school basement or something, I think [that's where] they shot this thing after painting the walls gray. Bruce Willis walks through, does that thing he does, and the movie's over."
"This is entertaining and all, but the movie is neither scary nor intriguing enough to transcend its cliches and redundancy."
"A lack of focus plagues the entire film. The director, writers and actor himself have conspired to render the title character blank, lifeless."
"As a scary movie, Truth or Dare is about as frightening as a slip on a banana peel."
"Even ghost stories aren't allowed to be so ludicrous as to show a gut-shot character carrying on as if suffering from nothing worse than a mild wedgie, or a guy trying to drag his own body to safety."
"Marks the second time that O'Quinn has been in Young Guns and Dalton in The Rocketeer, leading me to conclude that I've wasted too much of my life watching terrible movies."
"This do-over isn't so much an improvement over the original as lousy in a whole new direction, a nearly bloodless slasher film with fewer surprises than a broken jack-in-the-box."
"Nice as it would be to herald Tusk as a return to Smith's bold early period, the movie has a lurching tone and an airless atmosphere."
"It might have been successful had it included enough optimism to countervail all the misery. But Knight unwisely and a bit heartlessly chooses to forgo that kindness to sink us into the bleak of it all, and does so during the darkest days of the year."
I left with the unshakable feeling that this is the type of movie Costner would've starred in (and made better) 20-years ago.

Give this one a pass and see Winstone in 44 Inch Chest instead.
"A triumph for Anne Hathaway, who brings to the young Jane the same jittery wide-eyed intensity she displayed in The Devil Wears Prada along with a secure British accent. She and Mr. McAvoy inject a keen intelligence into the couple's verbal jousts."
Even Space Chimps was better.
The interesting premise of the film starring Tom Hanks and Emma Watson is gradually disarranged to fall into the implausible. [Full review in Spanish]
"As physically stimulating as Troy purports to be in content, the mental aspect of this film has all the charge of a defective catapult."
"As long as the hoopsters mix it up with the Whoopster, it's fun. A second-string story keeps interrupting, though."
The moral here is that no challenge is insurmountable if you form a club. And keep a wine opener handy.
Gone in the Night suffers from the same nonsensical tropes that doom bad horror movies&#46; Rational thinking and self-preservation are tossed over a cliff then run over by a truck&#46; I laughed out loud at the foolish decisions made&#46;

Simple Wedding is cute but it needed to be more than that.
Commits the cardinal sin of cinema: it's boring. Feels like two hours of highlights from a 20-episode miniseries that only hint at a rich story tapestry.
"The story is bad and the writing even worse, but one would at least expect a skateboarding movie to feature some noteworthy stunts. Not so."
Celebrating a culture that is past its prime and being too serious are two grave errors that keep Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie from itself being fabulous.
"Running a painfully long three hours, Dogville is pretentious with a capital 'P.'"
"The tone, pacing, and overall feel of the film is disjointed, split up into a series of scenes and plot twists that feel overly familiar or just poorly developed."
Sea Fever reveals itself to be a reasonably well-made and low-key but otherwise unexceptional riff on such horror classics as Alien and The Thing that doesn't really bring anything new to the party.

"The movie is really just one big lagging metaphor, which is why it comes across as so generic ."
It's dispiriting to settle down for a Guardians of the Galaxy picture only to find you're watching Field of Dreams with added asteroids.
"The film's charismatic cast certainly makes the film easy enough to watch, but one constantly expects and wishes for the film to deliver more than it ultimately does."
"A botch job of mistimed scare scenes, bland characters and computer-generated hyenas."
"In spite of the fact that the film will likely bust box office records, this reviewer is duty bound to report that it fails in almost every aspect."
"... provides some scattered big laughs, although beneath the film's surface, the jabs at global celebrity, extravagance, and inequality aren't especially insightful - even if they're true."
A comedy-mystery that's neither funny nor mysterious.
Pic simply isn't funny or frightening enough to expand its appeal beyond core fan base.
"If the performances were more accomplished, or if the murder mystery storyline were less marginal, or if%u2014the simplest fix%u2014the film were simply shorter, we might not feel as weary about spending time with these fashion insiders."
Sometimes you pan a deadpan comedy because it's effectively dead.
"All too often the plot feels calculated rather than organic, the result of a time-tested formula rather than genuine innovation."
Sometimes the 79-year-old filmmaker's practice of churning out a film every year results in a miss.
"Characters are constantly trading insipid remarks and thrilling each other with their perceived intellect, but their intimacy feels like a closed circuit. The spark never reaches the audience."
Their experience deserves a better film than this.
Sequelitis means that there's no high-flying good times with How to Train Your Dragon 2.
"This glittery Disney product may boast the biggest, fastest advance sales in movie history but it remains largely a mystery to those of us with an age in double figures."
...a campy mess that presumably has little in common with Márquez's acclaimed work.
"Returning director Steve Pink often simply shows his actors a prop -- a piece of furniture, say -- and asks them to make jokes about it."
"The movie has an undeniable, dour force, but it's basically conventional macho filmmaking, and it's extremely violent."
Joy is a frustrating movie because I can't remember the last time I wanted to like a movie so much and it just wouldn't let me.
"Despite superb performances by Judi Dench & Sophie Cookson, it's muted and meandering, missing every opportunity to be memorable."
"It’s a distinctly low-effort affair across the board, from the simplistic plotting (our heroes chase the bad guys, then find them) to Cage’s performance..."
"You can sense [director] Tucker and [Felicity] Huffman trying too hard to get it right, and strain is never convincing on screen."
"Gives us a Round Table and a flashing Excalibur but no magic, no mystery, no mythic resonance."
"The fantasy that is this film's central contrivance is so much about superficiality that it flits from mind before the end credits finish. Or, is that just relief?"
"The kindest context in which to put Over Her Dead Body, which was written and directed by Jeff Lowell, is that of a training film, a public display of people trying to master their craft. The best way to see it is not at all."
"While it does contain a number of big laughs throughout, both the film and the character grow a bit tiresome after a while"
"An aimless, mind-numbing prestige picture with uneasy undertones it seems desperate to deny."

"Prisoners is a dog whistle for Academy voters keyed to a pitch that screams, ""For the love of God, nominate me for something!"""
"While his classic hyperbolic visual style is back in force, Stone can't bother to muster any of his usual righteous anger, instead mischanneling his discontent into a kind of zen acceptance of these perpetually tiresome main characters."
The film certainly isn't interested in the engineering of drama; just shock and disgust and the projection of Von Trier's incoherent ideas.
It seems fairly likely that this is a case of returning once more with a bucket before the well runs dry.
"One also has to wonder why, as a general principle, guys in movies so often end up engaged to people they really don't know and aren't right for. Oh, right -- that's how Hollywood marriages are."
The cascade of coincidences and logical lapses drains it of excitement and leaves it seeming overwhelmingly ridiculous.
"Movie is dopey. And with its emphasis on stupid violence, xylophone abs, and getting yourself on YouTube, it's yet another product that makes you feel bad about today's youth culture."
"It's bad enough Q tries to squeeze in heady messages about gun control, healthcare and workers' rights, but it also insists on playing up the button-pushing race thing."
"A thinly plotted, anonymously directed film."
What big clichés you have!
A cinematic violation made worse by the fact that von Trier is such a gifted filmmaker.
"A glossy, facile and TV-ready tribute to a heroic woman who deserves a much better movie."
It's more than a bit disappointing to watch as Joy's initial world-building and establishment of tone become diminished...
"A parade of beloved characters walking through and waving as well-remembered scenes are re-enacted around them is not a story, but a pantomime."
"Wood, a very long way removed from his Lord of the Rings glory days, is a womanising, drug-taking small timer, essentially decent but easily led astray by his friend. They're on the road to nowhere and that's where the film is headed too."
"A few bright spots aside, Bowfinger's jokes almost universally fall flat, with missed comic opportunities buzzing by at every turn."
The Red Baron is like Le Grande Illusion remade by a German porn director. Never in the field of human film-making was so much money wasted on so little.
"""The Bang Bang Club"" divulges little insight into what keeps this dangerous brotherhood banging away around the world."

Brugge and Haythe fail to satisfactorily pull off either the thriller or the marital deconstruction.
These characters become wearisome.
"If too much charm can kill, this emotionally manipulative nostalgic love letter to cinema directed and written by the 32-year-old Giuseppe Tornatore is a killer."
"A punishing film to sit through, and its rewards may well depend on how much credit you wish to give von Trier for doing something different. Because, for better or worse, Dogville is unlike anything else you'll see on screens this year."
"Half Nelson is, I suppose, well-intentioned, but it's also junk."
"There are few directors that cinephiles are aching to return to form more than Brian De Palma, but unfortunately, his string of misfires continues with this picture."
Left me feeling exploited as this vile pretentious thriller never committed itself to being more than a rip-off scare flick.
"Even Paltrow seems out of place in View from the Top, and that's saying a lot."
"Shots of musty skylines don't pack much power in this post-Inconvenient Truth era, where every luxury hi-rise is advertised as a 'green building.'"

"...a woefully hit-and-miss adaptation that is, in the end, more miss than hit."
An aggressively mediocre improvement on the first film.

Nothing to write home about.
The new Belgian comedy Mother Schmuckers wants to be a trashterpiece like Pink Flamingoes. It likely wont be since its not really rebelling against anything.
"This is an insufferable movie that telegraphs everything from its opening minutes, and does nothing to elevate the genre or even tell an interesting story."
"Things quickly spiral into a bloody mess, of course, in a way that seems designed more to appease series fans than to add meaningful narrative substance."
Any hope Reynolds had of reviving his stardom with Self/less is as fruitless as thinking a person can swap bodies without consequence.
"Sadly, the fact that it's attached to a successful toyline means it barely matters whether it's good or not."
"Positions the wrong person as the lead protagonist. The film lays its heart on the line, but its focal point is off."
"The writing is amateurish, which is sad since it comes from an Oscar winner. The directing is self-defeating. And the lead actress is... well, is Megan Fox."
It's this unfortunate reality that Velvet Buzzsaw can never escape: its pedestrian genre mechanics.

"It wouldn't be a Michael Bay movie if he didn't slavishly cater to the lowest common denominator (get ready for some sexist and gay-panic jokes!), so it makes sense that Bay's antiheroes are more obnoxious when they're trying to be good."
"It's a cult film, all right, but not like 'Eraserhead': It's more like a cult film created for inductees into some New Age self-actualization movement..."
"After Steven Spielberg's original, which combined shock effects with comedy and grand sea adventure touches, the series has degenerated into your basic fish-bites-man story, with very few imaginative wrinkles."
"When the most sympathetic character in the movie is a potential suicide bomber, you know something's wrong."
"Some funny business here, a clever one-liner there, good-natured padding in between -- it's all pat and familiar and risk-free."
Hits the ground stalling.
Nothing beyond mediocre here.
"Like many villains before him, John turns out to have been wronged rather randomly, an act of terrible violence that he absorbs into his worldview."
"The actors don't spar, but jab and feint into the stale air that comes with such stuffy, fossilized movies as this. Put together again more for new Oscars than new audiences, it's a handsomely shot disaster."
"As a revival of a once-popular franchise it's a wasted opportunity, and no amount of prophetic visions, surreal imagery or portentous drivel can convince otherwise."
"While it raises questions about individualized female empowerment as it is tied to fashion and capitalism, it then fails to adequately answer them."
"When Max finally gets a chance to ask Jacob why the killer didn't kill him when he had the chance, the answer's as unsatisfying as the movie."
"Pak relies on the basics of writing and acting to express his ideas, but only ""The Robot Fixer"" fully makes up for cinematic shortcomings"

I was certainly swept up into its horrible clutches. But to what end?

"When is imitation NOT the sincerest form of flattery? When you're imitating Alfred Hitchcock, ALL of Alfred Hitchcock's ouevre, in a manic, misshapen mess of a thriller meant to be an homage."
"The bulk of the movie is played for gags before the serious stuff kicks in at the end. Its never easy for a director to reconcile such contrasting tones, and McKay is no exception."
"Only for fans of the cartoon series ... but even if you love the series, why pay the high price of theater tickets to see a slightly extended version of the exact same thing?"
"The D Train becomes as frantic and flustered as Dan, hopscotching from farce to drama, and ends up fatally stranded between the two."
"I wondered whether the shouts of ""Get off the ropes!"" were aimed at Ali or director Michael Mann, whose film spends much of its 167 minutes at risk of getting knocked out."
"It's hard to mess up a car chase up and down the streets of San Francisco and Fleischer certainly doesn't, though at these speeds we should be gasping and laughing instead of just nodding our heads."

"True, most Christmas flicks tend toward the trite and predictable naturally, but they just don't have to be quite this insufferable."
"An incomprehensible mess, & waste of time. Sci-fi that needs much more editing-of-purpose and clarity in the fog of its weird story. Rebecca Ferguson seems lost, for example."
It's amazing an entire studio would bend over to make William Shatner's ego trip.

"The film shamelessly imitates characters and situations seen in similar movies, like ""The Hunger Games"". [Full review in Spanish]"
"A Glitch in the Matrix feels like the worst party you've ever attended. It tackles the fascinating-and potentially dangerous-theory that we all live in a giant computer simulation. It does so in the dullest, most irresponsible ways possible."
"The film’s biggest trick might be casting Moore, Stan and the positively glowing Middleton and still never quite catching fire."
"It's a fascinating train wreck in many ways, with flashes here and there of the painful disquisition on mortality it might have been. Salvaging much more was beyond me."
"Every time the film makes you chuckle, you may also feel it's zapped you with a neuralizer."
The biggest problem with X-Men Apocalypse is that it is completely fragmented.
There's not enough tension for the humor to diffuse. What we're left with is a bland dramedy featuring a strong cast.
"The film's mise en scene and attempted energy aligns with something like Guillermo Del Toro's 2006 hit Pan's Labyrinth, but there's simply no emotional component whatsoever to Garrone's film."
"The patina of this avant-garde exercise is swanky and alluring, but chip away at it and you will expose a hollow center."
"It's fun in a superficial way, but kids, don't base your English term papers around this movie."
"Burlesque is so old-fashioned in its storytelling that it feels like what's happening inside the club is a time-warp from 50 years ago, while everything outside the Burlesque Lounge feels like ""Dancing With the Stars"" present-day in tone."
"Brother and Sister seems more like a retread (and a retreat) than anything that’s come prior, marking a new step forward for the lauded director by taking a disappointing step back."
a small dose of adrenaline in a film that could have used a bit more resuscitation.
On the positive side: impressive special effects. On the negative side: pretty much everything else.

"Montiel treats his story's happily unsung oddballs with sincere affection. He doesn't hold them up to ridicule, or insist that they snap out of their quirkiness and conform. But he doesn't quite know what to do with them."
"About Time absolutely seethes with the sheer aggression of Curtis's commitment to happy endings, family values and principles."
I cannot recall a film that left me with such a sour taste in my mouth by its end. Does the movie deliberately defy itself with obnoxious intent?
"I won't pretend that I had a great time watching ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation."""
"As people have been saying lately, you can't put lipstick on a pig. This movie shouldn't star DeNiro and Pacino. It should star Corey Haim and Corey Feldman."
One can deduce that boredom and free sex brings [Reeves] back to [Theron] for an extended stay as nothing they do that day can be viewed as earth-shattering.
Fans of the first two films in the series can expect more of the same in this serviceable yet unduly bland G-rated comedy that's all too reminiscent of those by-the-numbers Sixties-era Disney films that usually starred either Fred MacMurray or Dean Jones.
"By making Serena ornamental, Bier diminishes her power, and Lawrence plays her as a petulant Lady Macbeth wannabe. Worse is Bradley Cooper, whose Pemberton comes off like an entitled scion, not a clear-cut timber king."
"You wish the movie wasn’t content to be a feature-length meme and truly deserved what Cage is doing with this long, hard look in the fun-house mirror."
The predictability of its plot and sweet but adolescent love story may infect the older audience members with chronic eye roll syndrome.
"Contains some nice ideas, and occasionally, for whole moments at a time, succeeds in evoking the mysteries that it toys with."
You People features a stacked cast that delivers on occasion&#44; but the rest of the film suffers because of an uninteresting story and sloppy filmmaking&#46; 
"Orson Welles devotes 9,000 feet of film to a spoiled brat who grows up as a spoiled, spiteful young man. This film hasn't a single moment of contrast; it piles on and on a tale of woe, but without once striking at least a true chord of sentimentality."
Smile elicits a stone face&#59; it&#8217;s a twist on tried-and-true tropes without much wit or paralyzing terror to benefit an impressive Sosie Bacon
"It's like some mythical civil-rights Southern paradise where racism only rarely rears its ugly head, and thus feels contrived."
"Tears need to be earned, and The Son fails at that."
"Into the Blue is fun to watch because it's, well, fun to watch - particularly when its stars dive into the blue in their various skimpy bathing suits (which they do often), but it's not much of thriller."
"Like the desert beyond, the film is arid and airless."
What we've got here is a trifle that is too clever by half. That's not good.
"Oh, there s plenty of emotion in ""Garbo Talks,"" but most of it is false because virtually every scene is overwritten."
DC Comics' latest addition to their burgeoning cinematic universe fails in several rather spectacular ways.
"The latest collection of op-ed pieces from writer/director John Sayles, whose movies are usually easier to respect than enjoy."
"Bertolucci's overarching message - and the purpose of the story - is almost entirely lost to the youthful, callow, anarchic, pervasive sex and nudity."
Not exactly a hundred million dollars' worth of classic comedy.
"I found the idea of the plot more interesting than the plot itself, and am finding the movie more fun to write about than to see."
I wonder if it plays differently to those who've read the book and can bring that context with them. This should be Dovidl's story. Martin's self-pity makes it his own instead.
Predictable fluff.
"Well-acted with fine production values, but too pedestrian, cold and contrived to be truly engrossing, potent and provocative."
"KO -ed by a flabby screenplay and lacking the money to do justice to the '60s setting, director Neil Jones falls back on clever tricks - like using an HD Glove Cam - but fails to punch above his weight."
Wall is simply a poorly crafted means to begin the discussion.
"All of the characters have the right names, all of the necessary events occur, and indeed the very best local actors have been engaged. But the soul has been mislaid."
"Keeps milking the same gags and throwing the same bull, and after a while you feel cowed watching it."
The horror only rises out of grotesque deaths as if they were slasher museum pieces rather than the construction of a disturbing atmosphere that reveals the sanguine reverse of a childhood experience. [Full review in Spanish]
"A zombie movie in every sense of the word--mindless, lifeless, meandering, loud, painful, obnoxious."
The main problem is that the film is just too inaccessible to the casual viewer... It's also marred by a pretentious voiceover and far too much tree-stroking in general.
Silly fare with the bizarre humor evoking more giggles than guffaws.
Jeepers -- now they're making sequels to anything that makes a buck.
The Story of Us is a full length sitcom that's missing both the sit and the com.
Audiences everywhere are about to find out how abominably off-putting an extended diatribe masquerading as an ensemble drama can be.
"No matter how many speakers they add, surround sound will never sound as good as [a live choir], and the Gospel has a much better plot [than this film]."
Whether this movie works for you largely depends on whether you're willing to work for it. To which I say: Bring your gym clothes.
Every so often there is a hand-to-hand fight scene to cut the boredom -- the best is set atop a precipitously high wooden tower in a village square -- but even these don't set themselves apart from anything we've seen before.
It seems less than the sum of its time-slicing moves.
As vapid as it is violent.
Zoe teaches Kaz that choosing love over your family is impossible because&#44; ultimately&#44; family is love&#46; If only the filmmakers could have found a way to come to this conclusion without feeling so patronizing&#46; 
This is a kid's movie that doesn't seem to realize that it's a kid's movie.
To say A Dangerous Method is a David Cronenberg misfire is an understatement but not the end of the world. I applaud him for trying something new even if the end result is dead on arrival.
"Telling a sitcom-simple story with a frustrating lack of emotional and narrative depth, Coppola has produced a distressingly disposable film."
The way the sincerity and silliness collide here is as awkward as Jon Hamm and Hannibal Buress pretending they went to school together.
A borderline unwatchable mishmash of poorly conceived musical numbers and incoherent storytelling.
"If you want fan service, you got it. Two hours and 15 minutes of safe, unadulterated fan service."
Callahan's career as a crude cartoonist is where the real interesting stuff lies; too bad it's only touched on briefly in favor of reminding audiences of AA's 12 step program.
"Unfortunately, despite Snyder's quietly commanding presence, the docu's setup, a series of staged, would-be Socratic dialogues, feels forced and artificial -- everything Snyder's poetry is not."
"""The Danish Girl"" is a very pretty picture that could have used a more probing, maybe even more painful, palette knife."
"Academically interesting, entertaining in a perverse sort of way, but in the end feels rather pointless."
"This is not, in any sense, an accurate depiction of life at an arts school. It's a giant MTV VMAs performance."
"If anyone tells you Antebellum is like Get Out (and they will because it's the laziest comparison to make), tell them to get out of the Sunken Place before recommending any more movies."
"Oh, was there ever an opportunity here. But it's easier to go the traditional route, I guess, than make waves."
"I wish I could say I can't wait to see Kidd's next movie, but I can't say that. I can wait. I can wait just fine."
"This turns out to be another bad choice for Bullock who, without playing badly, sinks in the general morass."
"Snow White boasts some clever visuals and engaging action, but the story feels forced and better fit for a SyFy movie of the week."
"The Clone Wars may introduce a younger generation to the franchise - while chasing away existing ""Star Wars"" fans."
"Nothing that follows matches the stripped-down smarts of the opening act, and the promising premise never develops into a proper story."
"In a choice of lesser evils, you could do a whole lot worse... While it never climbs very high, it survives because we know how much further it could fall."
Some actors are better suited to straight-ahead dramas. Swank appears to be one of them.
"It's almost a poor man's Excalibur, but the fact of the matter is that the film displays far too little of the incisor-sharp wit and out-of-control mayhem readily available in the other two films. It just doesn't work. "
An interesting story featuring compelling characters&#44; but missing a narrative engine&#46;
"Having been blandly adapted from a Chinese folklore-inspired Manga, that's about as much of the story that makes sense. Gibberish in the extreme, it has all the narrative cohesion of a trading card game."
An unforgivable piece of cynical self-indulgence.
"Sadly, not even a strong cast can rescue a pot of gold from the end of this rainbow."
"Most fatally, the script doesn't seem to know what it wants to say."
"Problematic is Rios' central performance... or non-performance. Her Magdalena is too phlegmatic to jibe with the tough, strong-willed individual the yarn calls for."
An all around awful experience.
Engrossing and entertaining if sometimes trite and manipulative and totally bogus.
"This is a commercial for Tupac Shakur the icon, and there's more truth about the man to be found in any one of his songs than this entire two-and-a-half-hour film can muster."
"A good idea for an update, but the result is too wobbly to stand on its own"
"While I can't say what transpires ends up making The Boy a bad film, it does have the unfortunate effect of making it a less interesting one."
The film groans with shoddy ironies and overbearing serendipity.
"There are enjoyable moments scattered throughout... But, for the most part, Camera Obscura falls kind of flat."
"Predictable, affable, and completely guileless, the only part of Made in Italy that distinguishes it as having been made now, rather than any other random point in the last 30 years, is how grizzled Neeson's beard has become."
"I'm all for romance, you understand. But what makes this a drawback is that these people are all wrong for each other and that the filmmakers don't seem to know it."
"Imagine an entire film infected with hangdog sensibility, unrelieved by humor or narrative interest, and you have The Hawk Is Dying."
"Though I appreciate Buxton's rookie attempt to present an alternative look at teen rage, I can't help seeing that this overreaching film goes nowhere with only clichs to guide it."
"It's not bad, nor are its intentions anything less than noble. But it feels like countless movies before it, reliant on conventional war-movie devices and stock characters."
There is a special place in movie hell for Never Say Never Again. Not that it's particularly bad -- though it's hardly good -- but because it's such a cheeseball experience with a strange and horrible pedigree.
"If you thought 300 was silly, think of 10,000 BC as 33.333 times sillier."
It's a sequel to skip.
"Calling this as bland as white paint would be an insult to that criminally underrated color. The jokes concerning their differing views of childrearing are far too safe to be funny and Matt is such an overbearing jerk, you can tell why he's still single."
The trouble is that these brief highlights only serve to further underline the rest of the film's failings.
"White Man's Burden was worth doing once, if it only to find out it isn't worth doing again."
"Launched in time for Earth Day, the message is lost in the medium."
"Far too obvious, both in its execution and agenda."
A movie that's so manipulative it practically jimmies the tears out of your eyes with a crow bar.
The film goes up in flames when its '50s morality rears its ugly head.
"Silent Panic meanders all over the place with its dependency on outlandish coincidences, sophomoric dialogue, situational sluggishness, and the watered-down tension that makes the dramatic overtones feel synthetic."
Never before has a movie remake so simultaneously affirmed its inspiration's brilliance and also invalidated its own existence
As pointless an exercise in bloodletting.
"You wonder if [director] Meyers was so focused on establishing her main characters as frustrated, lonely and wanting that she forgot about the 'interesting' part."
"Luna is a tonal car-crash, a miscegenation of art-school pretension and countrified Boden midlife crises to a bizarre soundtrack of Spanish guitar."
"The movie is not without interest, but I found it mannered, derivative and opaque."
"[A] film that doesn't learn any of the storytelling lessons that the first film should have taught its creators, and instead doubles down on its flaws."
Not enough magic to mostly unfunny Carell-Carrey comedy.
"This is the broad, silly kiddie exercise it appears to be."
"Features a superb turn by Emily Blunt, though the characterization is generally so unfavorable that she'll be hard-pressed to gain much critical recognition."
"I kind of liked the film, I just wish there was a bit more meat on these very familiar bones."
"Far from heightening the sense of mystery, the flashback construction renders the present-day dramatically inert, giving fine actors little to do save deliver exposition."
For most horror fans it will be kind of a snooze.
"""Constantine"" isn't a movie, per se; it's a stunt with eye-catching effects that work to lure in audiences, those who, after seeing this beauty, will be the real lost souls."
An oversaturated film whose action scenes and committed performances by the cast rescue a rushed script... Full Review in Spanish
"Porn Theatre is exactly that, no surprises."
The tone is inconsistent and baffling&#59; if we&#8217;re meant to take the plot seriously&#44; we don&#8217;t&#44; and if it&#8217;s meant to be funny&#44; it isn&#8217;t&#46;
"While the package should be amply attractive to a broad family audience, what's inside it might prove a bit tame for many adults and not enough fun for kids ..."
"For what it is, the movie's OK, except that it tried to be more than it is, and it isn't."
"'Startlingly original' is not necessarily a good thing, particularly when it is at the cost of good storytelling."
"Amelia is a conventional, competent and often very pretty film; it's just never as interesting as the woman at its center."
"Billy Madison is a textbook example of a half-decent idea that never got developed beyond the ""lying around drinking beer and making jokes with your buddy"" stage."
The cinematic equivalent of a razor blade hidden in an apple.
"That such strong, capable women are called on to carry a film as shoddy as Ya-Ya in front of and from behind the camera is hardly progress."
The overall lack of any compelling storyline - or any reason to care about the people onscreen - made me start to squirm around the halfway point of this 131-minute movie.
"Everything about An Unfinished Life's screenplay is cliched and predictable, but the actors manage to elevate the proceedings above and beyond shameless soap."
[Duvall] loses the thread - and our attention - one too many times in a sea of lackluster conversations and unremarkable plot strands.
"Its a competently made film, but in an age where people have endless viewing options from streaming services, competent just doesnt cut it anymore."
Yawn.
It makes such a clear case for the horrors of racism at every level of American society that the more mundane horrors of ghosts and witches seem completely superfluous.
"A light, engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation."
"Mistakes insults for jests and racism for narrative guile. Director Jared Hess' tone is mockingly mean-spirited, making it virtually impossible to care for his motley crew of misfits."
It’s forgettable.
"Alas, it's another heroic and remarkable story undone by muddled and middling moviemaking."
"The surprise is that WWE's Triple H, Paul Levesque, is a nimble, appealing and large presence in the leading role..."
"Thanks to Al Pacino, Christopher Walken, and Alan Arkin - mostly just for being charismatic old pros who are fun to hang out with - Stand Up Guys is watchable, occasionally amusing, not altogether insufferable."
"Strange But True boasts a neat premise. But the initially taut thriller takes an unexpected tonal shift into overwrought suspense, losing some of its claustrophobic domestic tension along the way."
A 'live-action' fantasy increasingly trapped in a cluttered corner by cartoonish ideas.
"Give the film a stray thought, and the entire enterprise comes crashing down; after all, the project is built upon a foundation of absurdities."
"The revelation of evil not only confounds the characters here; it numbs the film, stifles whatever wayward life it once had in it."
No Exit is an apt description for how this mystery thriller gets trapped in its own stupidity. It starts off suspenseful and then it takes a steep nosedive into illogical nonsense. 
"So over the top you can't help but like at least some of it, 'Daybreakers' is pulsing with gore, mayhem and dark humor"
The movie is like a party that you can't remember attending the next morning.
The Gray Man only needs to half-occupy the attention of Netflix subscribers&#44; and it does not care whether they watch on a home theater system&#44; or on the toilet&#46; It goes through the motions of a spy thriller&#44; rather than actually trying&#46;
"Much as I would like to give Penelope unreserved praise, I can't stretch my lukewarm approbation that far."
A film lacking charisma. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Even if there's nothing else to process, at least there's always something to see."
"A bit of a guilty pleasure. But, most of the humor falls flat. Interesting that it's a Vince Vaughn vehicle that doesn't give Vaughn enough to do. Paul Chambers, CNN."
"Lynne Ramsay stylishly experiments with the 'cold-blooded murderer who cares for his mother' trope, but comes up only with blood-spattered armchair philosophy."
A cacophony of sights and sounds and a disjointed narrative dilute the message.
"With a premise as cavalier as this, perhaps director James Wong could have found a tone more original than post-Wes Craven cynicism. Instead, he panders to viewers, allowing them to take gleeful comfort in the destruction of the stupid and doomed."
"Tykwer loses his cinematic grip when he tries to blend murder and piety. In his hands, the two don't emulsify."
Much better in its panoramic views than the personal.  [Full review in Spanish] 
It's The Exorcist warmed over.
Flatliners is an unmemorable redux hampered by poor writing and a general lack of thrills that fails to capture the attention of its audience.
"Remake or not, if you're going to make a vampire movie in 2011, you'd better at least try to do something original. Something. Anything."
The coolest things about it are Tony Todd and the environment itself.
"The trouble lies in the film's noncommittal tone, which too often deviates from Lanthimos' reliable deadpan. Set against the earlier films' prickliness, The Lobster seems oddly ingratiating."
Stretching the limits of the Peter Pan mythology&#44; this ill-conceived spinoff with a contemporary feminist twist never achieves the desired emotional impact&#46;
"Like David Spade's underrated Joe Dirt, Dickie is great in concept, so-so in execution."
A comedy with two left feet.
A cynical mess that might make you want to take a shower as soon as you leave the theater.
While the heady plunge into a sumptuous dreamscape offers an immersive sensory experience unlike any other&#44; After Blue&#8217;s overindulgent pacing and impenetrable storytelling makes for a tedious voyage&#46;
Mediocre at best.
"The movie's depiction of these lost flower children, and what rendered them susceptible to Manson's brainwashing, is frustratingly shapeless and shallow."
"As the logical gaps widen beyond repair, and the melodramatic coincidences yield more questions than answers, you'll want to forget you watched it."
"Predators tries to spice up the hunt-or-be-hunted thesis, but from the get-go, director Nimrod Antal's movie has nowhere to run."
"Honestly, the thought of George VI flubbing his big moment pales in the larger picture. Via some closing text, we learn that he inspired the nation to strength. But politics is about more than being in fine voice."
"Adams' natural effervescence and Blunt's tart world-weariness come through well, but the dot-connecting screenplay and inert direction eventually leave them stranded."
I hated this movie.
Death Note suffers from an unsolvable identity crisis.
"for those unlucky souls who may be forced to take children to the sequel, there is a bit of semihappy news: Although 'Dozen' was obnoxious, 'Dozen 2' is merely innocuous."
"Matt Smith is miscast in the crucial role of Manson, failing to summon the cult leader's manic energy or make us understand just how it was that he had so many under his thrall."
"A four-hour, two-part epic that brings out Soderbergh's weakness for stylistic doodling, which sometimes strangles his material."
"I was really rooting for this to be dope but it just wasn't. It came off as a young woman version of ""Mamma Mia"" without a lot of the charm."
"Martin's trademark wacky humor is fitfully in evidence, but seems much more repressed than usual in order to fit into the relatively realistic world of single working people."
The Transporter Refueled isn't bad. Though it's still unnecessary.
"I hope Snyder had fun, because it might be a few decades before he gets another shot."
"There's something troubling about Page One, but it's difficult to give it a name."
"Sadly, and in a film that's 110 minutes long, it quickly outstays its welcome. There's a reason that Aquaman is such a perfect fit for Momoa's brand of muscled softy heroism, and none of that gets to shine through in Sweet Girl."
"The story bounces from island to island and event to event with a sense of humor, but no sense of flow or drama except during the fight sequences."
"Except for one terrifically adroit sequence in a subway, there is nothing understated about The Invasion."
"I'm not about to argue with the message, but the delivery system sinks below the level of after-school special, and the acting matches."
"Stone's film serves to muddy that line between a noble search for finite truth (or something as close to that as possible), and the meticulous actions of those whose only purpose is to distort and confuse."
"While Little Sister has its strong points, such as a quietly emotive lead performance from Addison Timlin as a nun-in-training visiting her family, the movie tries to juggle far too many narrative balls."
"It took 40 years, but Robert De Niro finally has made a movie that enables him to utter this line: ""Rambo the skateboard pimp was my tenth kill."""
"It's weirdly dated, and the Pygmalion plot device and metropolitan sexiness make it look like a movie that could have come out in the mid-60s."
But as in so much of this sprawling meditation-an odd mix where the heinously crass often outweighs the authentically beautiful-deep analysis is lacking.
"Its vision of reality seems so stylized, so fake, that I came out of it wondering whether it has the slightest idea what it's talking about."
Ayer's overly flashy direction epitomizes how the film never finds the right balance between too much and too little.
Often too pretentious to be profound.
"Fanboys won't mind the absence of depth or emotion; they may even welcome it for making the film more representative of its comic-book origins. The rest of us, however, cannot rejoice at the overspending and overkill likely to come in Hellboy III."
Disappointing.
"Alas, the film quickly loses its offbeat charm and devolves into a routine monster movie."
"Just -- yes, just -- one more film about that perennially obdurate subject, an artist."
"With a storyline as by-the-numbers as a square dance, the movie's one surprise comes with the closing credits -- namely, that this trite ""inspirational"" movie is the product of two world-class filmmakers, Curtis Hanson and Michael Apted."
"... plays too innocent with its premise, seldom allows its characters to gain dimension, and all but ignores the looming instinct of the plot to abandon its innocence and begin discovering the dark little secrets of the writer's complex world."
"For all the desperation and tragedy, then, the film offers a kind of heroism, set against a frankly grim but also frequently poetic backdrop."
"There's little doubt as to Chris Kyle's commitment as a protector of his country or as a father, but when the film ends, the definition of who Chris Kyle was remains a mystery."
"The movie is warped, to be sure, but even fans will have to admit that the laughs are stretched pretty thin over nearly 90 minutes."
doesn't suffer much thinking-about.
"Yesterday may carry The Beatles sentiment that ""all you need is love"", but its flaccid central romance does not justify the ""ticket to ride."""
Shame on Iggy Pop for letting them (ab)use his anarchy-anthem 'Real Wild Child' in a girls'-own flick that is so paltry it makes the recent St Trinians addition look like Picnic At Hanging Rock.
"Hartnett may grow into a major film star someday with better material, but this is a one-night stand he'll want to forget."
Never cuts much deeper than its subject.
"An existential-heist thriller with moments of dark comedy, JCVD is decidedly different and has its moments but you probably have to be a diehard fan to really cherish it."
The Last Jedi is built on a series of oppositions relative to one of the best known films ever made. It's the prisoner of its middle chapter predecessor.
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a film full of unoriginal action and fight sequences. [Full Review in Spanish]
"A movie that's eager to please, that wants to satisfy its audience at any price, even if it has to sacrifice good storytelling. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Quite incongruously, The Greatest Showman suggests that Barnum is a heroic figure, a woke entertainer and family man, who also capitalized on animal suffering and the veritable prostitution of human oddity."
It is silly almost beyond human endurance.
A dreary movie.
"A despicable, ugly and valueless exercise in hate, that purges all potential out of its interesting, original concept."
"Agent One: ""Hey, we just signed Tina Fey and Amy Poehler to a movie about sisters who visit their childhood home, only to find that their parents have sold it out from under them."" Agent Two: ""Sounds great. Who's doing the script?"" Agent One: ""Script?"""
"An overlong, mediocre fantasy that tries too hard to please every demographic."
"Layers of the story are jammed into the script, but what might work as a narrative device in a novel -- the spirit guiding readers through Nick's revelations -- is just plain ridiculous in a movie."
"A condescending, pessimistic portrayal of human nature, bereft of class consciousness or ideology..."
"By the time you get to the money shot of two lovers kissing in zero gravity, you'll either be deep in this movie's pocket or have fallen into a diabetic coma."
"Period costume dramas are always expected to offer opulent pageantry, but in the case of Vatel, that's all there is."
"Eventually falls prey to its own stupidity (including far too many homophobic jokes), and to a surprisingly lacklustre performance by Vince Vaughn."
"There are some admirable, if hard-to-watch, moments here, but the film's thriller tendencies are as half-cocked as its compassion for the struggles of parenthood."
"The Gilligan Manifesto never quite feels compelling or insightful enough to exploit its radical revelations to its fullest sensationalism. Unfortunately, Soling's clunky documentary never delves into this colorful notion with tongue-lashing vibrancy"
"Despite a smattering of jokes, Peyton Reed’s film just isn’t as much fun as the others. "
"Destination Wedding isn't a rom-com, it's a horror movie about a woman trapped with a men's rights activist."
"The dueling accents are meant to be part of some mounting joke, in which each woman sounds like an idiot to the other. It's not funny. Neither is most of the movie, which throws these two at a wall of gags and hopes they stick."
Why do movies like this happen?
"Did you ever think only male comics could obsess over infantile boob, crotch and sex jokes? The Boss will set you straight on that delusion, too."
"Jason DeVan's exorcism tale is proficient enough technically, but toothless and tedious."
"It feels less like The Hangover Part II than it does like The Hangover 2.0, as if Phillips were trying to go back and make the first film funnier instead of making a new one."
"In truth, astute viewers may note a more-than-passing resemblance to Star Wars..."
Julien Donkey-Boy really is an excuse to let Korine go nuts with his jerky video camera as he stitches together a series of completely unrelated and utterly vapid sequences.
"Harari’s interminable 168-minute saga sets the scene and paints the picture, but its languid pace and limited amounts of action or investigation of character make it a wearisome watch. "
"After its promising, hilarious setup, Cook's initial Kubrick-like smoothness quickly gives way to a ramshackle presentation with few follow-up ideas or jokes."
Battle of the Year would rather use crowd-shot cutaways to convince you of the dancers' prowess than focusing on the stage.
"This screen adaptation never quite jells, veering from family drama to stale 50s consumer kitsch."
It's a paint-by-numbers movie in a Van Gogh world.
"Main problem here is Braff, whose lack of conviction does little to get us involved with the various plot complications, least of all his. The result seems like so much workshop for all involved."
"Strewn with bad and borrowed dialogue and phrases, trite and overused plot points and costumes that cover the gamut from the 1500s Elizabethan codpiece culture to current-day John Varvatos ensembles. Even the wardrobe is incomprehensible. That's rare."
Kate Beckinsale deserves better than this. Always has.
Bleak adaptation of Brontë classic lacks passion and power.
"The script is one shockingly drab line after another, and nothing in the expensive 1930s period design can cover up the shabbiness of the moviemaking."
The movie is filmed in a way that makes it seem like the camera has epilepsy and the color desaturation renders everything murky. Someone should remind director Marcus Nispel that there's a difference between making a music video and a feature film.
[Lady Penelope is] Austin Powers redesigned by Hilary Duff - and just the dose of kitsch the rest of this IQ-deprived movie needs.
Gallo's passably amusing film only operates in a colorfully vapid light.
"Perhaps in this depleted landscape The War with Grandpa, a harmless but truly awful prank comedy, can find an audience in need of a distraction"
"All of the characters are back and some of the kills are bloodier than ever, but Halloween Kills fails to scare, fails to thrill, and fails at making any sense."
"Dear horror movies, ENOUGH WITH THE GODDAMN SHAKY-CAM!"
"If the group strikes gold at the box office with its new picture, Broken Lizard's Club Dread, it will be more for the seemingly surefire combination of extreme violence and extreme raunch rather than for anything resembling comic inspiration."
Letters to Juliet...it's a chick flick thing.
"What it's really about, more than sensitivity for displaced people or social analyses, is violence -- hideous, gruesome, over-the-top violence."
"LaBute can't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era: He's changed the male academic from a lower-class Brit to an American, a choice that upsets the novel's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film."
The screenplay by J. H. Wyman is squirm-inducing in its preposterous dialogue and haphazard plotting.
"The Little Vampire, a low-budget cartoon with supernatural characters who aren't so much undead as lifeless."
"While it warms up a bit in the second half, Doillon only manages a rather obscure, even myopic depiction of Rodin's considerable cultural iconography."
"To the extent the setup allows Spacey and Jackson to go head to head, it's a good thing. But there are other elements in the film that aren't nearly as interesting or satisfying."
It orbits too much around the satellite of coming-of-age clich&#233;s and never gets out of the boring routine of repeating the same nostalgic formula about &apos;60s domestic life&#46; &#91;Full review in Spanish&#93;
The Rocker neither rocks nor rolls.
"Dennis Quaid turns in a strong performance, but writer-director Ramin Bahrani's earnest but unfocused melodrama offers neither a compelling storyline nor a satisfying message."
"Sporting a stingy-brimmed hat and erratic Boston accent, Hanks gives a ludicrous performance."
Chad Archibald doesn't quite land Bite's transition over from claustrophobic character study into full-blown monster movie.
We are facing a film of emotional crassness. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Waititi has been interested in likeable, sheepish misfits, and the hero of ""Jojo Rabbit"" is absolutely cut from this cloth."
"It's an American movie as seen by someone whose main frame of reference is American movies, not American life. Therefore, while it's draped in a cloak of gritty realism, Besson's movie is really a kind of bizarre cinemaphile fantasy."
"A Dangerous Method didn't have to be another Naked Lunch, but Freud plus Jung plus Cronenburg should have equaled something a little more dissonant and troubling."
"schmaltzy, predictable, and insidiously imperialistic"
"It's as if Mann has simply run out of things to say about the crime story, but doesn't know what else to talk about anymore."
I didn't like this film so much. I'm giving it thumbs down.
"Whether it's the meet-in-the-middle budget... or Netflix's algorithmic influence that suggests a mishmash of subscriber-friendly elements but never one clear directorial vision, the film suffers from an overwhelming aura of exhaustion."
"Like the characters in virtually all road-trip movies, this mismatched pair stumbles into a series of chance encounters and misadventures."
After casting did its job&#44; the project seems to have been turned over to a classroom of fifth-grade boys&#8212;although I&#8217;d like to think the kids would do a better job of&#46;&#46;&#46;trying to close up&#46;&#46;&#46;plot holes&#46;&#46;&#46;&#46;gaping enough to drive a flaming tank through&#46;
"There was a good energy to the depiction of movie-Woody's nocturnal odyssey, and a few funny bits, but it was constructed upon a set of standard, and frankly, stale, comic premises."
The bottom line is that Highlander: Endgame should be a lot more fun than it is.
"A joyless and exhausting movie that squanders the talents of a dream trio: McCarthy, Tiffany Haddish, and Elisabeth Moss."
"Without the wit, raunchiness tends to feel uncomfortably forced. And the moments when Z&M works are, almost without exception, the ones that are more sweet than shocking. All the rest, frankly, feel like Apatow Lite."
"Director Scott Lew is not without his own cool ideas (having Reno 911's Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon play campus cops is genius), but his focus is all over the place"
Utterly specious.
"When good actors are reduced to peddling drama this squishy and compromised, tucking in tiny witticisms just to keep their adult honor, you wonder what sort of dopes Hollywood thinks we are."
"When You're Strange wobbles in the transition from straightforward biography to op-ed with teeth. At times, the editor doesn't seem to know what to do with the uncovered footage, or there isn't enough to string it into a visual narrative."
There's such an excess of plot and detail that characterization is neglected--none of these characters is more than single-dimensional...
Is Yes Man an entertaining Jim Carrey vehicle? No sirree.
"Africa's enduring sorrow is ripe for drama, but Blood Diamond is, finally, a fitting metaphor for the gems: Potentially brilliant from a distance, but upon closer inspection, one likely will see the flaws."
"It's got a stale premise, dumb jokes, [and] characters who exist only to remind you of other characters in slightly better movies."
"If all is right in the universe, the only good that will come out of ""The Resident"" is the murder of its director's career before it even starts."
The only way this could be worse is if it were a sequel to Jack & Jill.
Proves too much of a sketch-comedy creation to sustain a film.
"""Public Enemies"" had the potential of being one of the best adult films of the summer season. However, Mann's would-be gangster saga lacks personality. It fails to exploit its topic and its first-rate cast. And that is a crime."
"Official Secretsfails to present this topic in a cinematically pleasing way, despite an all-star cast."
"If Duffy's decade away has proved to be a humbling experience, you wouldn't know it from this bloated follow-up, which tonally goes all over the place, but its primary direction is over the top."
'Noelle' is reheated egg nog that has lost its joyful flavor.
"Cheesy underwater monster movie that, for some reason, I have a perverse enjoyment of."
"Mr. Gervais's long-established gift for small-screen comedy goes terribly slack, leaving him likable, as always, but, on the big screen, looking lost."
"A listless showcase of Hollywood clichs about crazy people, the '60s, and women, a reactionary, distaff Cuckoo's Nest."
"Stage Beauty is dressed to kill, and yet it never quite seems 17th century."
To force us to endure the Mongolian sojourn feels more like a trip of the ego than any other grand journey.
There's a better movie inside it struggling to get out.
"Joy represents a rare misfire for the director (we're going to leave the weird stillbirth that was Accidental Love out of the question), and while the film has a number of nominations, most of them rest on the shoulders of its star."
"Peekaboo, we don't want to see you."
Runs on clichés and ultimately earns more credit for what it doesn't do...than for what it does.
"Sludgy greens and smudged blacks assault the eyes, and crashing sound cues accompany every scare - dead giveaways of a director, Uli Edel, who trusts neither his audience nor his images."
"Stodgy rather than sweeping, with precious little of the wondrous excitement conjured by Alfonso Cuaron in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban."
"I would divide the potential audience for ""Oldboy"" into two groups: Those who will be disappointed and those who will be bewildered."
"There are no stakes here, just lots of robots and then dinosaurs who rise up out of the sea and place their large feet down onto pavement that rises up as random people run away and try to escape."
Sinks to the bottom.
The last 90 minutes crawl by as an extended estate-planning commercial replete with endless widescreen ogles of classic cars passing lush Floridian vistas.
"It would have worked better if the silly premise had been played for farcical satire, rather than following the cookie-cutter rules of the romantic comedy playbook."
Most children give up their poop obsession by age four. Tom Six still hasn't.
"Directed in moody and portentous strokes by Nicolas Winding Refn, this is the most abstract Viking movie you'll ever see..."
"They don't make 'em like ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" any more. Mainly because everyone got bored with 'em and stopped watching 'em."
"Sedaris is scary brilliant at inhabiting Jerri's lost soul. It's just that a little Jerri goes a long, long way, and at feature length, that is too long."
"If you're old enough to see how contrived it all is, you're old enough to skip this and seek out something more entertaining at the movies."
"""The Meg"" has its moments of fun. And it certainly delivers some spectacle. But it's a bit of a confused movie, too, that makes it hard to recommend. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
"The charm, verve, and clearly articulated vision a filmmaker would need to put this over are nowhere in evidence, though Hartley's sentimentality and wan cynicism are on grating display."
"The narrative is choppy, the pace is slow, it's way too long and, well, not a lot really happens."
"The entire movie feels like a warning for women of any age: if you act on your desires, you will be punished. And there seems to be no greater punishment than having to watch ""The Boy Next Door."""
"Thanks for Sharing is never quite crazy or funny enough to transcend its ""disease-of-month"" template."
"Keanu Reeves improves marginally over his laughably stone-faced slog through ""Reloaded"" - his emotional range upgrades from a spatula to at least that of a lint brush ..."
... it feels padded and stretched beyond its limits.
There's a bizarre lack of anything to care about beyond the dynamic duo at the center of the film. Chan and Tucker can only carry an audience so far.
A big dud that was bounced from last year's release schedule by Warner Bros. before landing here in winter's dreaded deep freeze.
Starts pretty well but it eventually falls apart for trying too hard to be a possession movie. [Full review in Spanish].
"I still cannot fathom whatever point Lee's trying to make here, or why he would derail his not-bad summer idyll with such a nuclear bomb."
"Simon Pegg is an incredibly likeable actor who seems determined to appear in as many unlikeable films as possible, but even taking into account recent debacles such as Burke and Hare, this represents an alarming new low."
"The acting is atrocious and more obvious than you see in many high school or college productions. The jokes are stale. The storyline is so predictable, I'll bet nearly everyone in the theater will guess what happens next."
Uneven storytelling prevents a deeper connection to the characters in this based-on-a-true-story drug tale.
"In a motion picture buried by its own lifeless, meandering self-importance, the viewer looks at the screen, takes it all in, and questions every step of the way why he or she should care whatsoever about any of it."
"Ferrell's credible performance notwithstanding, it's as if Raymond Carver's minimalism has overtaken the show. No 4-page short story here, we'll need a little something more for a 96-minute film."
[A] jamboree of Cold War emotion and ham-on-a-spit acting.
"The Guilt Trip is like getting rice pudding for dessert: it's sweet, simple and will do when you can't get anything else."
It's disappointing that Hillenberg didn't use his large-screen canvas to push the possibilities of the show.
"Coming in midway between 'Up in the Air' and 'Failure to Launch,' this comedy about a long-distance romance neither soars nor crashes and burns...not great and not terrible, just mediocre."
The original dared to push back&#44; to think a little differently&#44; to admit that it was time for Disney to evolve&#46; Its follow-up goes in the other direction&#44; searching for safety in easy familiarity&#46;
"Unfriended: Dark Web delivers quite a few howlers, if few scares. It might not be a classic, but it could be a candidate for a fun drinking game."
"As the trilogy goes out, more desperate than ever to convince us it was in on the joke all along, it's hard to say exactly what the joke was."
Italian filmmaker Paolo Sorrentino's Youth is a visual and verbal dribble about aging.
Semi-Pro is just Will Ferrell doing the same man-boy shtick he usually does.
"""Follows"" Fails to Follow Through"
Jumper is riddled with plot holes and useless action sequences in a wasted attempt to fill time.
For anyone who thinks Spider-Man 3 needed more superhero angst.
"While the picture contains no specific structural flaw or bad performance, it simply never manages to be engaging or compelling enough to overcome its overall bland and lackluster feel."
"Swapping politics for crass platitudes, Gods and Generals is a monumental folly."
"It's on the road that War of the Worlds makes the jump from thrilling to frequently unpleasant, as Spielberg burdens the movie with Holocaust imagery and commentary about terrorism and wars of occupation."
It's a movie about two people that ends up being about no one at all.
There are few horrors of war that can't be reduced to blockbuster shtick.
"Ironically, 'The Glorias' works too hard."
Bad News Bears has been robbed of its nerve and repackaged for multiplex consumption.
"As far as rip-offs go, ""Evolution"" is a pretty good one."
Slow-moving 2006 biopic about Scottish cyclist Graeme Obree.
"Heal pushes an agenda of unverified science and anecdotal evidence, and the harm that causes cannot be understated..."
"If you've been wishing and hoping for a movie in which June Squibb - here playing a dementia-riddled relative named Aunt Fishy - shows her underpants yet again, you'll love Love the Coopers. For the rest of us, to know them is to hate them."
"Taken 3 ends as it began -- another segment in a bloated, lazily drawn cash cow that offers a few laughs and high octane chases."
"Although its leads find the odd moment of charm together, The Upside fumbles far too often when it attempts to enlighten or edify its audience."
"Oh I'm sorry, I don't understand what any of this is for, it must be art. Pardon the hell out of me."
"By far, 2014's biggest disappointment."
"The film contains eye-filling scenery, exciting races and lively , stunts. Every thing, in fact, except spontaneously original wit."
It's another hung-out-to-dry whodunit...in which you never really learn whodunit.
"A surprising lack of passion in this movie, as someone apparently mistook Dark World to mean Brooding, Lethargic World."
"""3 Days,"" though not without pleasures, doesn't seem to know what it is; it's three not-quite-good-enough movies, all in one."
"This ugly, lumbering mess feels strangely like a tired Star Wars wanna-be, but made by people with the rights to the characters."
"It isn't at all emotionally involving. Charles Ryder remains a cold fish, and Goode endows him with good looks instead of personality."
The School for Good and Evil itself looks like it has chosen which side it will align with and it definitely is not good&#46;
"For the emperor penguin, celibacy is not an option."
"A sometimes illuminating, often slapdash and frustrating affair ..."
"If Sex and Lucia were any more explicit, you'd watch it in a booth and pay for it a quarter at a time."
The funniest part of the movie was in the outtakes reel that played as the end credits scrolled past.
"An ungainly horror mashup that works in pieces, most notably during its climatic free-for-all, but not as a whole."
"Outdated and schematic, this two-character melodrama belongs to the 1970s, when transsexuals were ""novel"" dramatic persona; even the gifted Philip Seymour Hoffman is defeated by the writing and direction."
"The film aspires to be an emotive and moving, but doesn't succeed. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Plucking the audience's heartstrings feels like the worst possible way to make a film about someone called The Iron Lady.
"The magic is missing from X Men: First Class, and without it, the film's just an average superhero movie with a dark side and a groovy Bond-era paint job."
"Monsignor manages to make itself the most extravagant piece of Hollywood junk since Mommie Dearest, for which the producer Frank Yablans and the director Frank Perry were also responsible."
"Contando com dilogos fraqussimos, o filme ainda revela seus preconceitos ao retratar como piada as pretenses amorosas de uma mulher de 55 anos."
"If it does turn out to be the big breakthrough hit that some are predicting, then it will just be one more nail in the coffin for the idea of Sundance being some kind of bold artistic mecca that celebrate the unusual and shuns the familiar."
"The movie is smothered by wooden characters, one-dimensional performances, a flawed story line and unforgivable cliches."
The protagonists must stop the creature quickly - but the filmmakers are in no rush to bring this second part to a close.
"Almost 60 years after his comic-book inception, the iconic Japanese robot Astro Boy finally makes his cinematic debut in a feature that, unfortunately, feels as if it has been assembled from spare parts."
"Two hours of non-stop, ear-shattering, humourless shrieking. It's simply unbearable. You soon find yourself begging for him to die."
Neither human nor beast will find this amusing.
"Though the script isn't very funny, Andrew Fleming's inept direction just makes the flaws even more glaring."
"9/11 trades on the emotional weight of its namesake day, manipulating audiences into feelings that have nothing to do with the mess that is actually on screen."
"Well, it was fun while it lasted kids. The ghost train shudders to a halt with Paranormal Activity 4, the first entry in the usually innovative series unable to produce any decent scares."
The main problem with The Duchess is that it offers up nothing we haven't seen before.
"Some filmmakers can imagine everything and select nothing, and while it's clear as a bell Tarsem has more talent than almost any 10 directors put together, in The Fall he's basically showing off with every new wondrous image."
There are bad movies out there... and then you have something like this. [Full review in Spanish]
"As a motion picture, this is fairly worthless, crippled by static direction, overblown performances and dull conflicts. But as a study of the American mindset at the time of both the story's setting and the film's production, it's a fascinating look back."
"In Stick It attitude comes before all else. Attitude runs crazy -- cartwheeling, handspringing, bird-flipping attitude."
"Drawing hazy parallels between the Cold War and the rise of consumerist culture, the film implies ideological battles are won by those best able to exploit the media in insidious ways."
"Despite a fun premise, Keeping Up with the Joneses is a mildly entertaining comedy that's very generic."
"Here, there's no great momentum, just a long, flat arc toward the inevitable."
The term for this type of film is 'self-important.'
"Director Antoine Bardou-Jacquet, who devised the story, is dazzled by period style and puerile jokes, but nothing lands as especially funny, merely tired."
"The film is, essentially, methodical rather than dramatically tense and, while it should be an exciting blend of guns and Puccini and sex in the china cupboard, it never fully comes to life."
"What we see most of the time is a slapstick, half-baked feminist fable: Kate Millett rolled in a Betty Crocker batter."
The movie works only to the extent you get involved with each kid's efforts or inability to adjust to the traumas of his past.
The fact that the pinnacle of this film puts the three lead characters in garbage bags yelling nonsense into the air is much more scathing than any review that could ever be written&#46;
"The film wants to treat Jeffrey Dahmer like a character, but it invariably frames him like a specimen."
The only thing I found unintentionally funny is Covino's heartfelt observations.
The script is longer on good intentions than on good dialogue.
"As an exercise in D&D-like world building, The Last Witch Hunter largely succeeds. But as an engaging action movie, it falters."
"Armour-clanging, cloak-swishing tosh with okay battles, terrible dialogue and sadly little horror or heroism."
"Danes, radiant with intelligence, warmth and common sense, captures your heart. Sadly, the same cannot be said of Evening."
Neither performance ... can help the movie accomplish much with its characters.
There are balls of lint smarter than Dragonball Evolution.
"Gross humor and lackluster acting make this a movie not worth seeing, but the worst part is, it's not funny - and that you don't expect from the Farrelly Brothers"
"[Abbas'] story demands to be heard, though Tucker and Epperlein lack the material for a full feature and pad this out to 73 minutes with some incongruously playful elements."
Offhand you might imagine that doing an animated version of 'Romeo and Juliet' with the characters played by lawn gnomes...would be a terrible idea. Now you have unassailable proof that you'd be right.
"At times, Ghost in the Shell is beautiful, even stunning. But these visual pleasures can't mask the narrative emptiness."
"[Jeff] Nichols's tale has no real urgency, and as a result, Loving feels vacant."
"Packed with potential, but Blomkamp can't pull it together to make it work. He's conflicted if he wants to just make a fun blockbuster or a commentary on today's society, but not choosing a side results in a disjointed, lacking effort."
"If the film is meant only as a pulpy genre exercise, Matt Shakman's competence in various modes actually works to strip it of any sense of coherent vision."
"You could bother debating D'Souza on history and semantics and rudimentary logic, but chances are you'd end up feeling like Meathead arguing with Archie Bunker."
"Dirty Dancing may just be one of the most seminal garbage movies ever. But, garbage it is."
"The bravura acting is unsupported by a script that's content to settle for the dramatic equivalent of English comfort food, with moments of pathos and whimsy doled out like spoonfuls of dough and treacle."
"Still, I would recommend Soundwave for aspiring filmmakers at least for seeing a low-budget film tackle a high-concept idea without relying on special effects as a smokescreen."
His stunts feel realer than his stakes.
"The tone is an awkward mix of savage jungle naturalism and cuddly animal antics, and it only confuses things further when the filmmakers throw in a couple of songs from the original movie."
It would be easy to dismiss the plot as confusing&#44; but that would be generous&#46;
"While it's worth applauding Alexander for not making its legendary hero 100% hetero, there's nothing else to recommend about this stilted, tedious epic."
A shrill and preposterous musical Western.
Prehistory repeats itself in this dispiritingly slothful third installment.
Josie and her bandmates are so bland that a brief but memorable send-up of a posturing Backstreet Boys-type male vocal quartet actually overshadows them.
You wonder who thought any of this was funny.
"Unfortunately, and rather like the critical reception that Lowry's work received for much of his lifetime, it's getting only a grudging cheer from me. Matchstalk men, indeed."
"In the end, a viewer can do little more than appreciate Dead Man's shimmering look and wish all involved better luck in their next endeavor."
Just a waste that deserves to be forgotten rather than attacked.
The Pirates! Band of Misfits doesn't quite deliver the memorable sea shanty that keeps audiences coming back for another verse.
The cinematic equivalent of spilling boiling hot coffee on your mother when you bring her burnt toast for breakfast in bed.
"[Kevin Costner] is winning too much puff press for ""risking"" his stardom. Washed in John Barry's symphonic syrup (close your eyes and you see Out of Africa), the film basks in the comfy, 1-2-3 storytelling that once ruled Hollywood. "
"One of those movies that features end-credit outtakes that are much funnier than the film that preceded them, this endearing but messy assortment of gags just doesn't merit a full-price ticket."
"Even for a Michael Bay movie, this robot-on-robot sequel is a pointless, messy assault on the senses. The special effects, of course, are flawless. The rest is scrap metal."
"It's not a very good movie, but, like its director, Ron Howard, it's so benign and apple-cheeked that it seems churlish to complain."
This is a YA-franchise by numbers.
"It's often a challenge to figure out exactly what Triple 9 is, a problem exacerbated by a script that packs in far too much plot and not nearly enough guidance in figuring it out."
"Suffers greatly in comparison to Michael Bay's Pain And Gain (2013), a film with which it shares much in common ... Everyone does way too much except for Kate McKinnon, who is absolutely brilliant and not utilised nearly enough."
"Ferdinand provides the kind of be-yourself, make-love-not-war, antibullying messages kids probably need right now. But unfortunately, as adorable as its flower-crazy bovine hero may be, it doesn't do that with enough magic to get them to actually stick."
"Despite Pacino's formidable skills, it's not very interesting to watch him tap at a keyboard and mumble."
It's possible to love one of these movies and hate the other...
"Miller gives a go-for-broke performance as the increasingly desperate and undone Sedgwick. But she lacks the fragile charisma evident in even the coarsest Warhol films, and without it there's no reason to care."
"""Furious 7"" finds the franchise at an unwanted crossroads, but it makes such a play for the diehard fans that it leaves everyone else at somewhat of a loss."
"The Woman in the Window could have been a piece of dark pop art under the right circumstances. Instead, whether through studio meddling, a bad foundation, or a combination of both, the movie is a frantic patchwork populated by unlikable characters."
"Playing up the socio-religious rifts of the first film, the sequel reflects the country's current political schisms."
They set out to make a sci-fi film with the power to change the way you look at your fellow man. And they made one that just made me want to leave this planet that much sooner.
"Resist being beguiled by the breathless pace, and you'll realize that there's little to the Tenenbaums' loopy but well-funded misadventures."
It's like watching a John Carpenter greatest-hits reel done by a rank amateur.
"It's starting to become clear that the success of the 2014 original has been a blessing and a curse, with writer/director Matthew Vaughn desperately trying to capture the formula that made that first film such a success but failing miserably."
You won't be bored - but Russell never convinces you that this mop-maker's story is worth getting in a lather about.
"One would think a film about WWII codebreakers would be gripping entertainment, but Michael Apted's thriller only fits the bill for part of the way."
"Parmanu makes you wonder how can an earnest on-screen adventure with a potential to end with a big bang on the silver screen, end on a whimper?"
There were plenty of fart jokes and dog burps to make my kids laugh.
I refuse to believe that the dreadful Hollywood-archaic screenplay which numbs The Horsemen (Astoria) was entirely the work of Dalton Trumbo as the credits vouchsafe.
"...more about Bjorn Lomborg than it is about the perils our world faces, now and into the future. I would have preferred more of the latter and far less of the former."
"Like the has-been it celebrates, this gentle comedy wears out its welcome by embracing mediocrity."
"Just as spectacle alone can't save the average summer blockbuster, so can it not elevate Army of Darkness beyond its journeyman writing."
"Any hope of tapping into the Twilight vibe is pretty much neutered by the film's haphazard storyline, stuttering pace and inordinate length."
Chiklis has atoned for his sins here with later roles. This Belushi biopic is monotonous and even racist (Belushi's inept guardian angel is Puerto Rican cab driver).
"The comedy is too broad, lacking the subtlety that the film's high-brow intentions require."
"Brilliant or obscure? Engaging or pretentious? Intense performances, artistic cinematography, ambitious editing and eclectic music are the filmic elements, but obtuse storytelling with almost incomprehensible dialogue completes the picture"
"In 35 years' time, I rather suspect today's popcorn fix will simply be described as 'pants'."
"All the performances are fine, yet they're fine mainly because there's almost nothing in the script to severely botch, so safe, rote, and mildly soporific are the proceedings."
"""The Headless Woman"" might have gained unworthy praise at film festivals, but it isn't worthy of market approval."
"'Orlando', Sally Potter's second film as director, strikes me as a period drama with noble intentions about gender identity and the long journey of female freedom, but its fantasy tale lacks grace and some vigor. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Time wants the viewer to empathize with the very real turmoil this family endured, but the film doesn't quite hit the mark."
"The movie is a significant improvement on its predecessor. Then again, it's difficult to state just how incompetently made the first movie is."
"Unfortunately, things peter out very quickly . . ., becoming the cinematic equivalent of the sort of over-sugared junk food that the story continues to decry."
"Every bit as violent, profane, mean-spirited and artificially sentimental as any live-action Adam Sandler movie."
Just a bunch of strange character traits strung together for no reason other than quirk.
Too often the filmmakers rely on lowest-common-denominator prison rape jokes and lazy plotting to allow for action-comedy set pieces.
"Big, dumb, loud, and pointless, it was clearly made solely because it's a preexisting property."
Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the movies -- The Return Of Helen Hunt!
"It all plays like a made-for-TV film with some nudity and scatological humor thrown in, but it made a bunch of money."
Bullet Train is shooting nothing but blanks.
"Some credit is due for artistic courage and craftiness on Lowery's part for this low-budget wonder, but ultimately A Ghost Story doesn't hang together in any substantive way."
"I don't know how Dutton bagged Halle, but something tells me it was a slow day for simultaneous lightning strikes and lottery wins."
"The fault here lies in the film's dead rhythm, which never lights the sparks necessary for an action film. The plot and action progress like an eroding lakeshore, but the energy and excitement are washed away in every scene."
...generally as far-fetched and overwrought as its 1950s sci-fi brethren.
"The writing and direction pull their punches, opting for a 'be cool, y(TM)all' ethos and the hazy glow of tribute instead of the messy reality that Greene himself reveled in lancing."
"Quoth the other, more bewhiskered and musically inclined Brahms, ""The only true immortality lies in one's children."" Oh, Johannes, if only you knew."
"The Mummy is everything wrong with the current state of cinema. Hollywood is giving movie fans content they didn't ask for, and are expecting them to accept it with applause."
There's a lot about Mohawk that simply doesn't work.
"Something of a disappointment, despite solid work from Hanks and Tucci -- it's as if Spielberg assembled all the ingredients for a great film and then decided to experiment and threw away the recipe."
It's heavy going at times...
"What if I misinterpreted the whole thing, and it was really intended to be a straight drama with occasional light, humorous overtones? And what if pigs had wings?"
"At times, Monster Trucks faintly echoes E.T., but it has all the grace of a jacked-up Ford F-150 with a four-link suspension and tractor tires crushing a row of cars by steamrolling atop them."
"While there’s great value in a film so willing to confront the terrible fact that love isn’t always enough, The Son doesn’t know how to do that without spiting us in the process."
Rather than creating authentic empathy from the audience&#44; the film is more interested in making a spectacle of Charlie&#8217;s suffering and his body&#46;
The end result is deadening and the decision to pad out the running time by setting up lots of sequel-ready narrative possibilities is horribly arrogant.
Has little more than color and motion going for it.
"Powerfully acted by select cast members, but the production bites off more than it can chew when balancing a desire for emotional authenticity and the comfort of dramatic formula."
"It's entertaining, in an unabashedly cheesy, proudly retro sort of way."
"The elephants featured in The Protector have more personality than the star, which is a real problem."
"It's hard to imagine any African-American not taking affront at Gods and Generals, which doesn't even get around to the controversy of slavery until more than halfway through the movie."
"The director of the film, Justin Kerrigan, is 25. He sees his story from the inside. It's based on his friends. There is no perspective, no angle."
Sadly nails how a certain segment of today's young population acts.
"[T]he central performances seem to exist in their own, isolated bubbles."
"After a fairly tense opening featuring Reynolds, the movie gets bogged down in an incoherent terrorism plot, along with absurdly sappy scenes of Jericho discovering human emotions."
The plot of the sequel is both convoluted and familiar.
"In the end, the plot is disappointingly simple. The terrors of the first two movies are explained away in a summary flourish, and their mysteries neutralized. The script is not good."
If only there was more to The Surrogate than ephemeral beauty.
"There are good movies about the transformative power of dance, but all this one does is parade stock characters around and hint at tiny changes they've made in their lives."
"effective at creating a desolate, haunting atmosphere, an uncanny visual strategy that sustains the film for much longer than it deserves."
"Joel Schumacher's ""8 MM"" jumps into the underworld of pornography as quickly as a scared rabbit scurries under a fence."
"Wakanda Forever is very long and needed an intermission. You know it’s a Marvel movie because it’s steeped in boredom, with every scene threatening to not end."
Most of the characters are one-dimensional stereotypes ... and the climax is a championship bout that's both utterly predictable and out of key with the story as a whole.
"After a promising start, the script begins to sound like it was written by little girls playing Barbies."
"When it's good, it's very good, but when it's bad, it's awful."
... lame contrivances and stale drag jokes ...
A performance from Macchio so irritating that the goodwill left over from the The Karate Kid is gone in a finger-snap.
"[The Terminator franchise] keeps doing this over and over again, and I'm tired of it."
Let's be nice and call this an acquired taste.
"Su principal atractivo es el de ver cómo Hollywood es capaz de tirar el dinero para producir un filme que se irá de cartelera de la misma forma en que llegó, con más pena que gloria."
"Neeson has certainly starred in worse action vehicles, but rarely have they been more forgettable."
"Manages an epic feel and an extreme runtime, though the former is oftentimes merely a result of the latter."
"...a torturous, boring, nonsensical monotony."
"""Horsemen reappear in London; world holds its breath,"" blares a newspaper headline in this sequel, rather overestimating the world's fascination with magicians - as well as its recall of the first movie ..."
"The Sting, which is about big-time swindlers, is meant to be a roguishly charming entertainment, and I guess that’s how most of the audience takes it, but I found it visually claustrophobic, and totally mechanical."
"The actors try hard, but the screenplay isn't solid enough to keep any of them consistently clever."
Watching 'The Whole Nine Yards' and waiting to laugh is almost as futile as licking a popsicle stick in the hope it may eventually start to taste sweet.
"Ghost Rider ... cannot claim to say much about human nature, but who could not love this actor?"
"I've had more interesting -- and, dare I say, thematically complex -- bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf, point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama."
"There's no way I can write this review without mentioning the absurd amounts of rape, sexual assault, torture, and other horrific and hard to watch moments that are placed in the film for next to no reason."
Good idea that never fully plays itself out.
This movie is so boring that the mind floats to extraneous matters ...
No doubt is aiming for a Catch-22 or Dr. Strangelove. . .it feels more like the Mel Gibson/Robert Downey Jr. vehicle Air America.
Second-string Woo.

"Dazzles the eye while dulling the senses. It is as gorgeous as a painting, and almost as motionless."
"[Sweeney Todd] is a wonder to behold, but only those with Burton's acquired tastes would want to sample a pie overstuffed with such joylessness."
"Derivative, stale and tacky - don't bother..."
"Tedious, lazy and thoroughly nauseating with no palpable thrills or excitement to be found. The asinine script and excessive use of shaky-cam will make your eyes and ears bleed simultaneously."
Proyas succumbs to the inane post-Matrix tendency to pump up action sequences with sudden moments of slow motion gymnastics that are almost laughable
An uncanny homage to one of those late-period Woody movies where he just filmed the first draft.
"Wayward and unsettled in style and story, as if to reflect the restlessness of cul-de-sac lives, it never catches at its characters for long enough to make their unsettled waywardness compelling."
Calamitous
"Elizabethtown strikes a note here and there, but does so while remaining tuneless and formless overall."
The Italian horror maestro Dario Argento is an old dog (at 81) without too much interest in learning new tricks – certainly if his latest is anything to go by.
"The way is left open for more movies in a lucrative franchise: 52 Weeks Later, 104 Weeks Later, or maybe Nine 1/2 Weeks Later, the porn version with Kim Basinger."
"It's just. awful. for most of its run time, content to squirm and squeal instead of explode with absurdities"
"Too focused on events, timelines, and connections to find an emotional core to the story."
"None of the characters breathe... They're knocked helplessly, lifelessly around in the service of the oh-so-serious story."

Ready to Rumble is not much fun at all.
"[It's] told in such predictable and bland fashion it dulls the effect. And this in a movie with Robert Duvall, Lucas Black and Melissa Leo."
"Critically, with the exception of comic actor Steve Harvey (as the 'hood mentor) and Lil' Kim (a mere cameo as herself), the acting is wretched."

The ill-conceived Hannibal Rising plays sort of like how Death Wish might have turned out had Charles Bronson's vigilante been a bloodthirsty cannibal.
"breaks through potential tedium with such consistency that he strings the movie along, threatening to make the whole thing work"
"The bad news is that three months' added work may have improved the animation, but the filmmakers couldn't use that time to make the cliche-riddled script more interesting."
"Every movie coming out this year but ""R.I.P.D."" should pause for a big sigh of relief: The possibility of any of them being called the worst cinematic effort of 2013 has, as of today, just about disappeared."
"All the presented ideas are undercooked, leaving audiences with an overlong, sentimental, waste of time only mitigated by actors still putting in reliable work"
"Many of the lines and the shadings brought to them by these expert performers are good for some laughs, and pic has plenty of energy, but it can't be taken as seriously as it wants to be."

"Minnelli's weakest musical, with few redeeming qualities"
"It's all very tasteful, if not terribly exciting."
Neeson in another Taken-type role. But it was only good the first time. This one is not good.
"A creepy thread flows through Jonathan Glazer's ""Birth"" that imbeds this wannabe thriller with a decidedly unpleasant austerity...**"
the climax arrives and the whole thing collapses into schlocky Gothic horror...the film's themes condensed into the most generic platitude. It's like opening a Tiffany box and finding a piece of paste jewelry.
"Sure, a cheer for gentlemanly honor. But like Chamberlain, ""Munich"" misses the moment."
Entirely confused and annoyingly confusing action inanity. Donner should know better.
"Clever, but not clever enough to make its central conceit work."
"It might be elementary, my dear Watson, but ""Sherlock Gnomes"" is a limp follow-up to its fun and charming predecessor. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, etc. - also Available)"
What starts out as a merry enough romp soon runs out of steam and becomes painfully labored.
Wrung to the point of unwatchable by meandering monologues and slow reveals.
Not just a letdown but an absolute disaster.
"All it does is mine stereotypes about the small-town Upper Midwest that were starting to get cliched when ""The Music Man"" was first staged in 1957."
"Feels like a mash-up of It's a Wonderful Life and Xanadu, without the wholesome sweetness of the first and the campy excesses of the second."
"In a Hollywood where men still pen 85% of all films, there's something sour in a movie that roots against a woman who asserted her artistic control by asking to be a co-screenwriter."
"A ho-hum, routine action thriller that lacks any thrills, is badly paced and poorly written."
"Not likely to go over too well with Mayor Bloomberg and his tourism bureau, is this tabloid cinema crooked cop thriller and ghetto housing project horror spree looking worse than an Afghan war zone on a bad day."
"It's nice to see this story onscreen, but frustrating to watch it try to have it both ways on virtually every plot point."
"It's self-satisfied and simplistic in the way that Glee was at its worst, a pantomime of mugging and vanity that believes it serves a higher cause."
"The shlock series had its perks, but the reboot offers only name recognition."
An occasionally ridiculous film about a man who was far from ridiculous.
V for Vendetta is a piece of pulp claptrap; it has no insights whatsoever into totalitarian psychology and always settles for the cheesiest kinds of demagoguery and harangue as its emblems of evil.
"Haggis lets a tantalizing sliver of doubt toward Lara's innocence linger, leaving open the possibility that John is a love-struck fool rather than an avatar of faithful spousehood. And then it gets dumb."
"Its sole purpose appears to be to confuse, to muddle and to blow our minds."
"Whatever romance Gruen summoned forth from this rough and tumble world of show people living by their own laws in a traveling, self-contained world of poverty and cruelty, director Francis Lawrence has hacked and ground it off."
I'm just not on the guest list.
Dear Frankie is a cinematic definition of mediocrity.
"The first half of the picture is a lively examination of a questionable idea for a financial adventure, while the rest of the effort could qualify as one of the worst movies of the year."
"This retelling of the familiar tale is as solemnly predictable as a Catholic-school nativity play, and nearly as dull."
"With any Jordan film there are a few moments of poetry, wit and transcendence. But you need a large net to catch them here."
"You'd have to be very young and naive not to see the twist coming, but perhaps that is the point."
The most lighthearted movie about existential despair you'll likely ever see.
"Passengers is not a film I would recommend that you rush right out to see. However, it will make a good rental on a snowy night this winter"
Spoiler Right Here: Ben Stiller is in the woods.
"While I don't doubt that Miele's heart was in the right place when she wrote Wander Darkly, the resolution feels false and manipulative."
Director Colm McCarthy hasn't generated enough filmic propulsion to lift it out of the deep wheel-ruts left by its numerous antecedents.
"Bayou Caviar might sound like some sort of sublime South Louisiana delicacy, but it's really more like gas-station sushi. That is, it beats starvation -- but only just."
What it turns out to be is an odd assortment of subplots and flashbacks which disrupt the flow of the main story&#46;
"Despite a fun and goofy opening, and a decent, if outlandish premise, the film squanders the latter and doesn't maintain the former, thus resulting in an overall lackluster comedy."
"Despite plenty of drugs and a fair amount of sex, Garage Days asphyxiates from a lethal lack of rock'n roll."
"The film smothers its authentic parts, never lets its drama take root and grow, never lets its characters come to life."
Its effect wears off very fast. [Full review in Spanish]
Walker's acting is so somnambular that even his car's steering wheel stands a better chance at grabbing an Oscar nomination.
All we're left with is a movie that reminds us how good its source material once was and serves as a warning to anyone considering bringing a series to the big screen.
"The material's bizarrely retconned conceptualization, absurd twists, and overall fanfiction quality are self-consciously clever, distractingly so. "
The movie's a handbag full of formulaic fluff.
"The cast is top-drawer, the movie is competent, but beats are essentially the same, and as a fan of the ""original,"" I found that frustrating."
"It's strangely unsatisfying, a Hollywood tattletale best suited as a subplot to some yet-to-be-made Woody Allen film."
"Leaves the impression that no matter how striking the aesthetic, Seidl is really not telling us anything we don't know already."
"Dreamz is amusing enough; but be prepared for comedy that's more crass than class. If you want refinement, see the more clever Thank You for Smoking."
"draws us deep into something from which we emerge with an initial sense of thrill, but are ultimately left with a lingering sense of what might have been"
"Like Saw II (2005), another grisly sequel to a film that seemed to have hit on a foolproof formula, this third Destination blows it, big time."
"As a spawner of merchandise, Cars 3 fires on all pistons but, as a movie, it's a harmless but never stimulating 109 minutes."
"Tezz, a dull and derivative film which is a mash-up of Speed and a few assorted thrillers based on speeding objects meeting unmovable body parts."
It's kind of hard to care about the plights of these individuals when the characters feel like disposable cliches that could have easily been interchanged.
"Almost worth seeing because there's nothing else like it, it's also easy to wish there never will be again."
"At the center of the film is the interesting idea that we're all putting on performances for each other; unfortunately, the manner in which ""Mistress America"" explores that theme also makes it a movie where moments of authenticity are scarce."
The problem is that none of it feels remotely engaging or interesting.
"Remarkably faithful, except in how it rather boldly transforms Dave Eggers's drama into a broad comedy."
"the twists flail along one after another until enough people have been incarcerated, incriminated, or killed to prevent any further deus ex machinas from imposing themselves on us"
"Smug but fascinating: The movie is a woman's cry of anguish for an unjust world that enables men at all levels of age and power to get away with cruelty, brutality, murder and even war because, well, 'that's what boys DO.'"
Visually stunning but dramatically inert coming-of-age tale
"Stallone may believe that he can turn back the clock to the golden era of his career, but I'm not convinced that this kind of brutal, bellicose naivety sits so well with audiences any more."
"Bella turns out to be a clumsy message movie, one that leaves a lingering bad taste, whatever your beliefs regarding its highly divisive subject, abortion."
"Wins points by bringing something new and refreshing to the table, but A Cure for Wellness is too long, too repetitive and doesn't stick the landing. [Full review in Spanish]"
A useless horror comedy for 2002.
"Atomic Blonde is largely a vacant, hyper-stylistic romp that trades on the thick Cold War atmosphere of far better films (not to mention The Americans). It's all dagger, no cloak. But it has two things going for it."
It's to the film's great credit that silly elements never get in the way of the film's grand passion
Time to go back and stay on the East coast.
One need go no further than the film's first segment to grasp how little interest the latest entry in the anthology series has in generating chills from the lo-fi.
"[Leduc] remains a small and rather irritating sideshow to the more powerful St Germain crowd, and the focus on her life is surprisingly dull."
"The Woman in the Window is what Clueless's Cher Horowitz would call a ""Monet"". To quote, ""from far away, it's OK, but up close it's a big ol' mess""."
"At last we are making crappy horror films entirely on our own, without having to rip them off from Japan! U-S-A! U-S-A!"
"Intermittently amusing, distinctive, not always easy to digest"
"The dirty-cop drama Pride and Glory overshoots the mark by spinning its implausible, hyperviolent tale around too tight a family circle."
...like watching James Stewart smile his way through The Lost Weekend.
"Unfortunately, despite a couple of solid performances, the film doesn't break any new ground or offer any particular illumination on these grisly crimes."
"Too ethereal to be a satire and too arch to be a psychologically recognizable character portrait, Damsels in Distress flits prettily by without ever finding anything to be about."
It's a deeply conventional movie about ragingly unconventional people.
"Ninety minutes is a long time to devote to a single joke, and while this peek into the backstage lives of comedians is fascinating up to a point, Provenza and Jillette could have made that point in 20 minutes."
"Ottman and the cast have done a good job with a limited script and budget, but it's not worth rushing out to unless your a major fan of teen horror flicks."
Why is Gerard Butler still making action movies? Why is there one more ...Has Fallen flick?
"The film isn't good, exactly -- Natali struggles to keep the creepy and goofy elements in balance -- but it's just weird enough to become a cult favorite."
"But that script really is a disaster, the only thing missing a cameo by Tony Todd foreboding doom."
A complete misfire.
"This remake's technical miracles are so impressive that, oddly enough, they end up being almost negligible, lost in a sea of confused decisions."
"Director Stephan Elliott made The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert but here he doesn't seem to know his farce from his elbow."
"A visually-captivating fantasy for teenage males with raging hormones, the demographic most apt to enjoy watching an invincible vixen in spandex waste wave after wave of mindless mutants."
childish sexuality and stunning obviousness.
"For all its potential, Fabricated City remains a patchwork of half-realised, undercooked ideas crowbarred into a generic formula."
"If you want to see what a cinematic piece of dog barf looks like, go see House of the Dead, otherwise do yourself a favour and play the video game, it's far more entertaining."
"Despite Tracey Thorns haunting score and Agnes Godard's spellbinding photography, the film feels aesthetically and narratively discordant, crammed with too much style and too many ideas to ever coalesce into something truly memorable."
Fans of Scott's previous sci-fi efforts will be desperately disappointed to discover a film which promises an innumerable degree of far more enticing themes and ideas than it can ultimately deliver.
"No point in faulting the performances, but Starling is a wounded bird of a movie that just doesn't fly."
"Nobody seems to know quite how to navigate the assembled elements, casting off a disappointingly flat thriller ..."
Another reason not to get the 'Supernatural Package' at the one-hour photo.
Why do we have to have jokes about spitting and flatulence and other vulgarisms in a movie aimed at children?
"An imposing but unwieldy hodgepodge of fragments from other films, it lurches between gargantuan sets and set-pieces with little sense of grace or pace, let alone space for emotional engagement."
Stupid is the nature of this Hasbro-produced action franchise - but would it be too much to ask for something that was dumb fun?
"In The Mix is not just mixed up, it is muddled."
"Heavy on atmosphere, but light on substance."
"With ""Irresistible,"" Stewart wants to have his blueberry streusel and eat it too, attempting to craft ""biting"" commentary with no teeth, that patronizes but refuses to offend, and stumbles over itself trying to be both snarky and sincere."
"Kazaam never brings off the trick we most want to see: It fails to make the jolly, 7-foot-1 Shaq larger than life."
Forster and co. have produced what just might be the dullest zombie movie ever made.
Switches gears from toothless celebrity satire to gooey family dramedy.
"Like last year's Seabiscuit, the movie spends too much time harping on ancillary bustle, and not enough watching the title character put his hoofs to work."
"Quite simply, Eye of the Beholder doesn't make sense."
"Despite some haunting imagery and committed portrayals, the film never establishes an emotional foothold before detaching itself completely with a series of arbitrary plot twists."
Yudin's decision to opt for a wide-ranging collection of shallow portraits sabotages any chance of learning something meaningful or profound about these men.
Rules Don't Apply is a clumsy and tonally uneven period piece... that suggests Beatty should have stuck to retirement.
"What kind of self-hating, emotionally stunted child is Ally supposed to be? She's the quirky adorable bubbly cute heroine of the romantic comedy of the week, that's who! The one all women can relate to! Because we're all like that, doncha know!"
"Artifice without true artistry...the writer-director means to excoriate American hubris, of course, but what he makes all too evident is his own."
"Star Trek was kind of terrific once, but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy."
"Even for a Disney sports movie, this is a treacly affair, complete with an Armageddon-style hero shot that just screams manipulation."
"An awkward combination of nature documentary and kids' movie, with dubious educational value."
You could hit up the DVD value bin and stage yourself a Lionheart and Kickboxer marathon to see the man the way he'd want to be remembered. Or at least the way I'd like to remember him.
A tedious production made worse by Webber's pseudo-operatic score.
"Pretty full of itself and doesn't try very hard to follow through on its potential, blatantly opting for style over substance."
... a low-key meditation on grief and the power of memories that winds up feeling more manipulative than sincere.
Did you hear about the worst rom-com of 2009? It's this one!
Owes more to 'The War of the Worlds' than the war of ideas that made the first 'Matrix' stand out...
A hugely charismatic turn by Pene&#769;lope Cruz is wasted.
"Bouwer's film is anthropocenic horror with plenty on its mind, and has some great -- and I mean great -- effects and makeup work, but it struggles mightily to put those pieces together in a satisfying and meaningful way."
The thrills are fun in the moment&#44; but any characters or surface-level plot details introduced are merely stepping stones meant to propel Bud forward in his quest&#46; It makes for a serviceable but ultimately forgettable romp&#46;  
The overriding sappiness keeps killing the so-bad-it's-good buzz.
"The latest in a long line of forgettable efforts from both Hopkins and Pacino, who sleepwalk through this dreary, nonsensical movie, professionally trading lines with co-stars as their eyes slowly glaze over."
The writers leave us little to think about after they've created such blunt stereotypes of the bad and the good.
"It is possible that ""Birdemic: Shock and Terror"" is one of the worst films ever made ... and that is precisely why it will not be forgotten. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Dialogue has never been Besson's strong suit, and so Valerian is at its best when it's wordless. The Fifth Element director's calling is finding the fun between the operatic and the trashy, with visuals that are both busy and elegant."
Tom Clancy's Without Remorse is too thin in its story and too repetitive in its action sequences to make much of an impression.
"There are facts that can be gleaned from the film, but the audience is still left looking for the whole story, any of the whole stories, and will leave disappointed at having gotten none."
Perhaps it needed a young M Night Shyamalan to endow it with some final whiplash twist.
"Think of it as the fictionalized version of last year's engaging documentary Mad Hot Ballroom, with teen dancers and sexier moves. It is also more formulaic and clichéd, thanks to the predictable plot and theme."
"In the gospel according to Boyle, he sacrifices storytelling on the altar of eye-catching special effects. After deductions, Millions is only worth a few smiles."
"If Phantom Thread has a problem, it is that it's so full of fraught confrontations, even those that are outwardly genteel, that it sometimes feels more like a compilation of outstanding scenes than a great movie."
"It's not that Superman Returns doesn't have any ideas, it's got too many; this is a film that tries too hard and wants too much."
"Despite the glut of strong performers, the thing never gets past its cumbersome, detonate-everything high concept."
What sounds like a David Lynch movie plays like soft-core porn.
"Another year, another crashing disappointment from M Night Shyamalan, for whom the success of The Sixth Sense must be beginning to feel like it happened to somebody else."
"A curate's egg, let down by juvenile humour, a pungent whiff of self-indulgence, and a dark turn that almost sends it careering off the road."
the best Verhoeven film since Basic Instinct -- if only that were a bigger compliment.
"Ironic, then, that The Invasion, the fourth film to be made from the material, keels over dead, killed by Hollywood conventionality and bland uniformity."
"Director-screenwriter Mark Mahon is unable to inject any freshness whatsoever into this highly formulaic genre piece, though he has elicited several good performances."
... lacks any hint of humor and no one seems interested in naturally performing the overwritten dialogues. [Full review in Spanish]
"This horror fanatic doesn't have room for Craven in his genre anymore. Collect your cash and call it a day already, Wes..."
"Instinct drags along like Keyser Soze's gimpy leg, stopping only to feature a few bad cliches."
"Generally succeeds -- in hit-and-miss fashion -- at bridging the gap between unlikable jerk and misunderstood good guy, though it's still something of a leap to leading-man territory."
"A thin conceit...slick, hyperkinetic but utterly superficial. You just might want to hang up."
"[Queen of the Desert] lacks even the remotest hook beyond curiosity about the primary subject, and even that fades."
"Domestic Disturbance is essentially a B-movie chiller with A-list casting, and that works against it."
This may all sound intriguing on paper&#44; but in practice it&apos;s often dull and strained&#44; and we get the queasy sense that this woman&#44; likable enough&#44; is beating herself up doing something that &quot;Kate Plays Christine&quot; essentially says is not worth doing&#46;
I think Skyline ultimately fails as a movie.
"Una pelcula interesante, si bien no original, sobre lo que significa crecer siendo un nio prodigio. Sorprendentes actuaciones de los pequeos protagonistas, junto al veterano y experto Bruno Ganz."
Becomes increasingly arbitrary and explicit.
"The film covers no new ground, offers no new concepts. and introduces almost nothing fresh in the way of storytelling or character development. Rudd and Reed made a solid duo in the past, but this time around the formula stands out more than the charm."
Director Chris Weitz goes the historically true story route with Operation Finale&#44; a mildly suspenseful mainstream film that suffers from being a bit too well-intentioned&#44; wraps up too neatly&#44; and the tension never heats up above a simmer&#46;
...and then Ben Stiller sticks a needle into Academy Award winner Robert De Niro's drug-induced boner. No cineaste should have to watch the mighty fall so low.
"The boo! factor is waaaay up there -- a nine on a scale of 10. But the makes-sense factor is something like a three, at best."
"At its best, it whips itself up into a nice, scary lather, but it shrivels to nothing between the set pieces, in an excess of fog, token bits of talk, and an absence of genuine, elemental awe."
"Masterminds, directed by Jared Hess, needs to go deeper into the tension between the way pop culture betrays its audience by displacing personal needs and then indoctrinating greed and restlessness."
"Watching Murder Mystery is a slog, and I still can't comprehend how the same dude who wrote Zodiac wrote this, and oh, did I mention this movie steals one of its final reveals from Legally Blonde?"
More of a sequel for sequel's sake than a justified continuation of the story.
Gilliam has a history of blaming studios when his films go wrong. But he has no one to blame but himself for this poisoned apple.
... this is a case of all the good stuff being in the trailer.
"Neil LaBute's latest is a mannered, disappointingly tame comedy of sexual desire and denial."
"It's something of a bore, and it's neither crackpot enough to satisfy your inner film geek nor plausible enough to elicit empathy. Billy Bob provides a wonderfully stoic presence, but he can't carry a whole rocket on his back."
"The filmmakers didn't think [Jean] Seberg was fascinating enough to show a more well-rounded view of her life, and instead they gave a lot of screen time to show the personal life of a fictional FBI agent."
"Not much here, as far as paranoid ""Is she nuts?"" thrillers go, but just interesting and kinky enough to warrant a look"
"Not one of Ferrell's best efforts and certainly not Wahlberg's, this movie is only sporadically funny."
"While the ghosts of teen romances past no doubt hover over many of us, after a while you might find yourself wanting to slap Paul Dedalus across the face."
&#46;&#46;&#46;just cannibalizes itself&#44; exploiting Japanese spirituality for a few Saturday-night shocks&#46;&#46;&#46;
"Gonzalez can be masterful in conjuring sexy imagery, febrile moods and erotic frissons, but his grip on the storytelling here is weak. Knife + Heart struggles to regain its initial momentum, falling flat until a lively climax."
Not even the expansion of Psycho's peephole into a bank of video monitors can convince of Panic Room's purported heritage.
One of those movies that gets most of the plot but none of the essence of the book.
"None of the character of, say, a Will Ferrell movie, or the cyncial wit of Harold and Kumar."
An “unfilmable novel” that turns out probably should have stayed unfilmed. 
A Coen-esque screwball.
Something has been lost in the translation...another routine Hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise.
"Hollywood does not know how to make a movie about women that isn't about the pursuit of romance. Even when women say they don't want romance, they're lying."
Let us now praise average men.
"Should my life flash before my eyes before my demise, I am certain that movie scenes will appear. I only ask that this movie not be included in the edit."
Thor has been emasculated and is a co-star in his movie&#46; It&#8217;s rote work for Hemsworth&#46;
"In one way, the film lived up to the hype. As Blazing Saddles's Lily Von Shtupp would say, ""Oh, it's twue. It's twue. It's twue. It's twue."""
"With the pacing of a death march and the theological heft of Angels in the Outfield, this feel-bad extravaganza is 2003's Exhibit A of why people avoid arthouse cinema."
"Surely there must be more here, right? No, there really isn't."
"With its musical themes for individual characters that come together symphonically at the climax, the music is so persuasive that it carries the narrative rather than complementing it."
"Despite the suspenseful premise, Prey turns in one of Blumhouse's weaker productions, which all comes down to unoriginality and an underdeveloped backstory."
nothing but wide and confusing circles
"It's tough to warm to a guy who doesn't give a damn about anyone but himself, particularly when you're supposed to be his closest confidante."
Be ready for a disappointment... though it's hard to come down too hard on any monster mash as pretty as this one.
"Knock Knock begins with a sinister, sexy premise, but its tonal inconsistency and misguided direction never quite let the film find its feet."
"Danger is just an overblown attempt to latch onto already-waning ""Just Say No"" sentiment in the U.S. (it was released in 1994). No dice."
De Mornay's performance vacillates so wildly between sweet solicitousness and icy murderousness that it draws as many giggles as gasps.
Nothing in Waking Up in Reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay.
"A shame then that despite some flair for impressive visuals, first-time director Jason Zada can't muster much in the way of actual horror, which is kind of a problem when you're making a horror movie."
"Serviceable, but ultimately pointless because not a second of this remake tops anything in the original."
Ron Howard leaves no trace of any artistic personality on the movies he makes.
The energetic first hour has a majority of the hearty laughs before the script shifts unsuccessfully into heartwarming mode.
"If nothing else, The Turning is probably value for money. Quantity counts for something, after all, as do good intentions. But they can't ever fully satisfy."
"There is plenty of amazement here, to be sure, but all too little in the way of grace."
"When the dust clears, and the disjointed coda is tacked on, the way is paved for a sequel, or several, and the audience is left wondering if they will appeal to more than the tweens targets for this one"
"An excruciatingly cheesy, hopelessly dated, profoundly unfunny and tone-deaf romantic comedy..."
"The Shawshank Redemption, was splendid; the second, The Green Mile, wasn't; and now The Mist continues the slide. I wouldn't say this is laugh-out-loud risible, but there are definitely moments."
"Spring Breakers strikes me as another of Korine's calculated punk outrages, a sploog in Disney's direction."
An autopsy for The Town would list multiple causes of death.
"Attempts to redeem the character in the final act, not wholly successfully."
"Jarhead is simultaneously audaciously original and so mired in the clichés it knowingly acknowledges, sends up and honours that it has little new to say."
El director toca fondo con una fábula para adultos tan ridícula como pretenciosa. Solo Paul Giamatti logra mantener a flote este fiasco.
"Movies used to boast of being 'torn from the headlines.' Now, they're torn from an electronics catalog. Who needs James Bond's Q when you've got Best Buy?"
The keen character work that is the movie's most impressive feature too often is overwhelmed by the twin bugaboos of R-rated vulgarity and unearned sentiment.
"Feeling old despite being new, and containing a less than engaging story that few will care about."
Office Christmas Party isn't good; it isn't bad. It's just ... there.
"If The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was the cinematic equivalent of a comforting chicken tikka masala ready meal, then its sequel has been left in the freezer too long and reheated to lukewarm."
A well-intentioned misfire that doesn't work in the way it intended.
"It gets off to a strong start, with some odd humour and meta charm but as that dissipates it turns into a formulaic snooze fest."
The main character is profoundly unlikable&#46;&#46;&#46; and the film becomes seriously gruesome with distasteful&#44; gut-churning scenes of violence&#46;  
"The Dig fails to address archaeology on anything more than a surface level, ignoring the fascinating psychological and emotional implications."
[Cassavetes and Kearns] stacked the deck so much that the movie becomes absurd.
"There's a naggingly studied tone to the whole enterprise that makes it feel like history class rather than a complex, urgent reckoning."
"Action is replaced with world-building, keeping the fourth sequel to the 2003 original more about course-correction than promised combat."
"Sets up a premise, pops in a couple of sweet moments and hits cruise control. It's never as cute as it wants to be."
Gorgeously scenery and a virtually dialog-free script lends this film an almost fairy tale quality that makes the most of the astonishing camerawork. And this almost makes it bearable as it heads into a rather cloying finale.
"No moral, little plot, a lead character deliberately left unknowable."
Too self-consciously offbeat for its own good.
"had the potential to be smarter, boundary-pushing science fiction along the lines of District 9, but with its underdone characterization and critical failures of imagination, it barely manages to meet the low standards of Cloverfield."
"To produce something as emphatically unfunny as this, the script's five-man team must have whipped themselves into a state of mutual delusion."
"Better than the first, but not by much."
"In what may go down as the most embarrassing, imprudent attempt at sexy dialogue in the history of cinema... Lopez ask(s) to be orally pleasured with the line, ""Turkey time! Gobble, gobble."""
"Personally, I prefer the Thai original, which is available on DVD. It truly gave me the creeps."
A long slog to a poor payoff.
"Blessed with considerable virtues, including a clever concept, crackling filmmaking and a charismatic star, it ultimately squanders all of them, undone by an unfortunate lack of subtlety and restraint."
An excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay.
"In addition to the generic science-fiction backgrounds, the characters all look to have been sculpted from the same brightly coloured dough. They have bounce but not much personality; it's the Megan Fox of animation."
"As lazers go, more minor than major."
Pawn Sacrifice has all the pieces in place (ha ha) and yet it's missing that intangible spark necessary to elevate a biopic beyond the realm of dramatic reenactment.
"While this remake of the H.G. Wells' classic novel and 1960 film is indeed a stunning achievement in special effects, his great- grandson and director Simon Wells really needs to go back a year and get the sadly lacking script rewritten."
Is this really the best the creative team could do&#63; Recycle the plot of a classic Hollywood musical comedy from 1952&#63; Send the younger members of the extended Crawley family to the French Riviera for obvious cross-cultural jokes&#63; I&#8217;m embarrassed for them&#46;
"It lacks passion and joy, replacing them both with something that smells a lot like mid-life crisis."
The Old Guard hasn't much of a sense of humor.
"Points for honesty: most feature-length toy commercials aren't so brazen as to actually make ""buy toys"" the explicit driving force of the narrative."
"A well-intentioned, big-hearted, wannabe-crowd-pleaser that just happens to be so incompetently made that it might be rejected by Oprah's channel."
"There's a tired, by-the-numbers feel to Elektra."
"If you seriously need a talking dog movie, go see Wes Anderson's Isle of Dogs instead."
"After taking in this brainless, by-the-book romantic comedy, you'll need a breath mint just to get the taste out of your mouth."
"Superficial when it means to be elliptical and regressive in its attempts to promote pride and tolerance, Sebastián Lelio's film is beautiful but vacant, the type of melodrama that reminds us that they shouldn't always make them like they used to."
The constant appearances of the almost-dead indicate how out of ideas this premise holds.
"As for the nuts-and-bolts of political strategy, Nichols navigates them as prosaically as he did in his last treatment of a sybaritic pol, the trivial Primary Colors."
"Underworld: Blood Wars, the fifth instalment, has little to recommend it on any level."
"""Grimsby"" punches down - at the sick, at the poor, at anyone who's not quick enough to get out of its sloppy roundhouse rights. Boy, chronically unemployed drunks sure are funny, aren't they?"
A serious look at P.T. Barnum's life requires acknowledgment of the ways in which his success manifested. The Greatest Showman is therefore just as much of a fraud as he was.
The limp&#44; negligible result is an unwelcome reminder that even talented filmmakers can and will stumble&#46;
The one thing that could have saved this movie from being a painfully embarrassing bit of mealy-mouthed politicking over what America is really doing in Vietnam is if it were genuinely funny or satirical&#46;
raggedly uneven in its execution [with several stories] all vying with one another in tone and mood and point and nothing but Depp's chameleon-like performance to tie them all together
"The movie is not only one of those stereotypical films about India, but also one of those 'white savior comes to rescue Third World village' type of films."
"[P]resumably in a misguided attempt to replicate James's own unresolved ending, Sigismondi serves up a succession of climactic scenes that will leave most people scratching their head and stumbling grumpily out into the street in frustration."
"The violence is over-the-top and becomes superficial. I found it all too boring, looking at my watch more than once."
"Greta is fairly ridiculous and blatantly obvious, and frankly, don't we deserve at least a little better from an Isabelle Huppert film?"
The dialogue has moments of blistering wit but even these brief flashes of gold are squandered with lame pay-offs and running gags that are just boringly repetitive.
"Patti Cake$ is not a bad film, only a mildly disappointing one."
"An aggressively hard-sell of a loud, abrasive comedy."
"That Santa Clause guy, Tim Allen, dashes through the winter sludge of another Christmas Carol knockoff."
It's never a good sign when your main character is also your least interesting one.
"Michael Mann's Blackhat is supposed to be a hack attack thriller. Instead, it is a bloody bore."
"No matter how many A-Listers director John Crowley (""Brooklyn"") brings in, ""The Goldfinch"" remains inert and dull. One wonders if the material would've been better served as a limited mini-series. It certainly doesn't work as a two-and-a-half hour movie."
Adults may cringe at the preachy heavy-handedness and the extremely limited motion animation that sets the art form back a couple of generations.
"Ridley Scott remains bent on the project of squeezing all suspense, mystery and terror (and, incidentally, life) out of the franchise that burst forth from his chest when he still had to listen to other voices ."
"One day, making sure each movie is engaging on its own, rather than acting as filler for more to come, might become a priority again. Unfortunately, that's not the case here."
The film doesn't manage to capture any of the childish wonders that come with one of the author's most playfully scary works.
I can't remember an apocalyptic film that's taken less interest in this planet as it's destroyed.
"A family freakshow complete with legless crooners, extreme flatulence gags, and Michael shrugging in a ""he's so crazy"" sort of way at Kirk's crusty bon mots."
...the movie goes soft and Heder ironically loses whatever star quality he had.
"There are a couple of good aspects to ""The Trip,"" particularly Steve Braun's performance, that will appeal to its niche audience."
...looks like a student film made at a friend's house where the only direction given to the cast was to scream.
It's impossible to dislike the message of this animated effort from Brazil even if it's easy to dislike the often ungainly and heavy-handed way in which it's imparted.
"Honeymoon tells a tight tale that sticks to it guns past its final frame, but revealing way too much far too soon immensely damages the film's overall effect"
"As with the first film it's got more arms than it can handle, so even with some wonky ones some of them still turn out to work"
This whole nauseating enterprise smacks of the basest exploitation.
The Mouse House factory churns out more cute with Ice Princess...you may have to go get our teeth checked for fear of getting cavities from all the syrupy sweetness.
A mess.
"A mawkish family comedy, intent to please, The Hollars plays like an extended sitcom."
"Adam&#8217;s Rib (1949) is by no means a great movie, but seeing as pale an imitation as Laws of Attraction makes one pine for its offhand, witty charms."
To call this rubbish would be an insult to rubbish.
"Like many of the 400-odd movies Roger Corman has produced and/or directed, Corman's World: Exploits of a Hollywood Rebel has a title that sizzles over content that merely simmers."
"Better than the first, but not by much."
A succession of tepid gags tethered by a flimsy narrative.
"An American Pickle represents Seth Rogen's subversive effort to make a point about family, faith and living in the 21st century. Fans of his will likely wish, however, that it had been less of a slapdash affair and something more cohesive to enjoy."
"The film is woefully one-note, and that note is a half-hearted grunt."
"Out Of The Furnace turns out to be a predictable, very ordinary retribution story, propped up by slumming A-listers and a gritty veneer of Rust Belt desperation."
"There's only so much even the best actors can do with a sloppy script, and Keeping Mum can't get over its lack of focus."
"'Triple Frontier' never becomes heavy-handed, but the feeling that goes from more to less is increasing and by the time you reach the end you think it has lasted longer than it really lasts for the wrong reasons. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"It's the sort of reckless, disconnected nonsense that could be telescoped or stopped at any point."
Their fish-out-of-water antics leave a nasty taste in the mouth rather than a smile on the face.
"A minor fan-fiction take on the franchise's mythology: Hey, maybe middle-aged Laurie Strode likes guns LOL? Nowhere near as feminist or as psychologically incisive as it thinks it is. And it's not even scary."
"Delia's suffering serves no real purpose. She, along with Dale's corrupt deputy, are two supposedly prominent characters who ironically do nothing to push the story forward."
A poor start of a universe which idea is better off in a tomb.
"This one isn't even worth watching on cable TV, unless you're ready to be fitted for a straight jacket."
"The fate of national heroes like the fictitious Franta is a fascinating subject that deserves a documentary all its own, so it comes as a surprise that Sverak pere et fils should devote so much screen time to a trite romantic triangle."
"At some point near the start of the 21st Century, Hollywood must have secretly decided science fiction is really just a synonym for drivel."
"The actors do their part, but Ingmar Bergman this is not, and by the end whatever patience you might have begins to wear thin as this group of irritating people finally find some measure of happiness."
"Premium Rush can't decide if it's a serious, ticking-clock thriller or an antic, stunt-driven cartoon."
What started as a beautiful one-off&#44; extended in a pretty decent sequel&#44; has now grown gray at the edges&#46;
The mercury may rise but pulses never do.
"A far cry from nostalgic Thanksgiving movies of the past like Hannah and Her Sisters and Home for the Holidays in happier times. It's being marketed as a comedy, but don't believe, it's a mad-as-hell microcosm for the Age of Anger."
"OK for laughs but less OK for emotional investment with the characters, who feel more like comic constructs than the real-feeling guys."
"Had the filmmakers taken a more easygoing approach, Locked Down might have landed in the realm of The Thomas Crown Affair."
"The plot is a tired rehash. Still, there's something to be said for big, buoyant spectacle in a summer movie. (I mentioned the ghost sharks, right?)"
Just Mercy has ideas and conviction. It's thoroughness that's lacking.
"Starts strong, ends with a slick tableaux and in between disappoints with a steady acceleration that not even a quietly charismatic performance by star Dong-Gun Jang, nor the image of a clown with a gun during the film's climactic shoot-out, can surmount"
"Alice touches on worthwhile concepts, with a love of the genre that's also apparent in how it treats its female lead. However, none of it feels fully baked. What does work here is thanks completely to Palmer."
There are quite a few long moments when everyone stands around waiting for Scott to throw in ad-libs that never come.
Katie Boland is ... a force of nature as Lake's feminist ex - who gets off on reciting the names of her favorite female revolutionaries. But neither she nor Borden can mitigate this film's ultimately creepy premise.
Long-time supporters of the show will enjoy catching up with the eccentric characters. Others may be left scratching their head and wondering if this is the female equivalent of a Hunter S. Thompson novel.
The mind boggles before being lulled into a stupor of inanition by this latest instalment of Robert Rodriguez's increasingly cheap-looking franchise.
"West, making his first foray into westerns, doesn't control the tone. Its somber, bone-dry gruffness crumbles to dust, only to be replaced by adolescent jokiness."
"There's no real reason to see it, and no real reason not to."
"Though the entire production bursts with cartoonish playfulness, it woefully underestimates humour and heart in the process."
Like The Breakfast Club recast as a videogame for simpletons.
"After enduring only a few minutes of this shrill debacle, you'll feel more trapped in the theater than Jimmy is by his bubble."
"The result is so derivative, they should've called it Eskimo Pie."
"Seems to have been assembled (at short notice, with blindfolds on) by people who have never seen any movies outside of Cameron Diaz vehicles."
"An attempted mashup of ""Gilmore Girls"" and ""The Graduate,"" ""Cherry"" fails to be either raunchy or sweet."
The problem is that Scott hasn't found a way to imbed his argument in the movie's plot.
"""Despicable Me 3"" has some laughs, but not enough to prop up what feels like a flagging franchise."
"There are the makings of a great comedy here, but you will not find more than scattered hints of it."
Ms. Flowers's career is just beginning. There might be a better documentary to be made about her some years in the future.
Too bad you must endure dialogue that's sappy and a story that's drippy.
Stocked with unfunny formula.
"Suddenly the Surfer, erstwhile intergalactic villain, is made into a Guantánamo-like victim. The image gives brief pause, suggesting that distraction by trivial, tabloidy celebrity events allows terrible injustice to prevail. Not to worry though: the Four"
"The details in Captain America deliver, but the big moments fall flat - you can tell that we're intended to cheer here, to weep there, but the scenes that try hardest to elicit emotions just feel deflated."
"The story, involving conspiracies, doesn't always make sense. And the surprises are easy to predict; director John Moore doesn't try to hide them."
"This noisy, dull, structurally messy adaptation of the popular videogame is a step down in the blossoming career of the gifted actor Mark Wahlberg."
... Why We Fight is neither fair nor convincing.
"Will Smith stars with aliens and zombies and superheros, yet this is his first film that's wholly unbelievable."
"Ocean's 8 fails to work not due to its all-star cast but because of director Gary Ross' lazy storytelling, lack of imagination and the film's glacial pace."
"[The] first auspicious sequence mixes the worlds of Mad Max, Transformers and Hayao Miyazaki's Howl's Moving Castle... But the film immediately runs out of strength and fails to keep up. [Full review in Spanish]"
"HairBrained play like a strangely adolescent offering, squandering its tiny gleams of talent for an onslaught of strained scenarios. Knowledge is power, generally speaking. Here, it's a notion exploited for deflating effect."
"If you need any more evidence that mainstream Hollywood is becoming a sinkhole for the greedy and creatively bankrupt, look no further than Olympus Has Fallen."
a footnote past its expiration date.
I was taken out of the movie a few times by the CGI-enhanced dog... Just use real dogs!
"Why'd anyone want to watch them do the Lip Sync Challenge after two long hours, when we just wanna get out, just wanna get right outta here?"
"That's right, it's time for yet another entry in that most-dreaded of genres: The XXXTREME Sports Movie."
"Without core chemistry, the already flimsy plot is unbelievable. Without any sexual tension, the fate of the Hudson-Dillon marriage is irrelevant. Without any reason for Wilson to cut up and caper, why watch him do it?"
"This catastrophic conglomeration of Puritanical repression and modern sensibilities squanders terrific acting talent and sumptuous production values, not to mention a darn good story."
It's amusing for a while. But it grows tedious.
"Distasteful and putrid, so disillusioned and amateurish that it can't even be bothered to properly wrap up its loose plot treads. Instead, when it finally hits a brick wall, it simply gives up altogether and ends."
The light breaking through yonder window is the glare of critical scrutiny - and Letters to Juliet looks pathetic in it.
"Unfortunately, the results are laughable."
"I'm not sure the wife or girlfriend would approve, but for the man of the house, it's above-average beer-and-pretzels material."
The film seems to have cobbled its set pieces together from a series of close-ups edited as if by random selection.
"Snide superiority is a Spacey specialty, but we've seen it so much already that it's starting to wear thin."
"Although technically superior to the low-rent Barney videos, pic, which was shot in the country near Montreal, still has a bargain-budget look."
"The jokes are astonishingly unfunny, splitting the cast between those desperate to please, and those looking to slip off with most of their dignity intact."
Seems an odd choice for Efron in his stated goal to become a serious adult actor.
"The film's impressiveness begins and ends with its sizzle-reel mentality, never amounting to much more than a dazzling technical exercise starring some really famous people."
"It seemed like a good idea, but the more you think about it, the clearer it becomes that The Avengers should never have been turned into a movie."
"The Chronicles of Narnia proves, sometimes, talking animals are not funny. Sometimes, they are waging a holy war, and Santa Claus is giving kids weapons for Christmas."
The current streaming war has turned films and shows that previously would have been direct-to-video &#40;or straight-to-television&#41; irrelevancies into critical pieces in an industry-wide chess match&#46;
"If the first film was humorless, its sequel is guilty of misplaced laughs."
"With The Curse of La Llorona, the Conjuring universe has damned itself to an eternal cycle of rinse and repeat."
Bone tired.
"Silly and derivative, it's a bit of a primeval disappointment."
A mostly jumbled array of biographical swatches.
There's almost nothing about this ultra-disposable programmer that doesn't feel derivative to the point of self-parody.
"At times, it may succeed at manipulating you, but you won't like it."
"The self-aggrandising opening is followed up by a self-pitying, superficial final half."
"The first part of the movie will strike some viewers as inspiring and others as manipulative; at any rate, it's clearly the better half, since the final act is patently false and a queer whitewash of a tragic chapter in US history."
A complete waste of time unless you are a diehard fan of Cristiano Ronaldo. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Mercury Rising is instead more of a dull thud on the action film map, fodder for Willis fanatics, and not much else."
This picture works so hard at entertaining us that it strips its own gears; its churning style can't quite keep the story going.
"Beneath Sorkins ornate script lies a The Show Must Go On parable thats been done better elsewhere. For a figure so key to American culture, its a sadly ordinary tribute."
"One of those movies that inspires a, 'what were they thinking?' response."
"Even by the low standards of cheesy revenge movies, Paparazzi is pretty terrible."
The trouble with embarrassment comedies is we don't all squirm at the same places.
"It is stunning how the people who purport to be fans of the original (and then get to make new ones) don't understand how the stuff of nightmares is the stalk and the chase, not the kill. Plus, horror blowing social commentary this badly is embarrassing."
"Music-video director-turned-film-maker Jieho Lee imbues his feature debut with plenty of visual verve, yet can't make his stories individually distinctive."
Three movies' worth of rom-com cliches stuffed into one.
"Plot-wise, there isn't great depth to The Recruit."
"A lot does go on in Jellyfish's slight 78 minutes, but it often feels more overdetermined than compelling."
Falling for Figaro settles for a series of predictable setups and expected clichés.
"Caveat emptor. This is really a movie about the ""me""--a starstruck adolescent from New Jersey who lands a bitpart in Welles's production of Julius Caesar, not so much about the great actor, director and leftwing mover and shaker."
Watching the movie becomes a kind of parlor game: Is Lee capable of murder? Which moment is the moment?
"If the film is intended as a viciously satirical jab at Hollywood gentrification, it certainly hits its mark. It just isn't at all enjoyable to watch."
[A] hackneyed supernatural thriller that plays like a cross between a Lifetime network spinoff of Final Destination and the infamous Bobby-in-the-shower episode of Dallas.
Action scenes feel slack&#46;&#46;&#46;&#46; Ritchie never allows viewers to get invested in the characters or the story&#46;&#46;&#46;&#46; The cast also seems underused&#46;&#46;&#46;&#46; The passable &quot;Operation Fortune&quot; is criminally ho-hum because Ritchie fails to deliver on its potential&#46;
"Mostly, this is a movie that simulates the experience of losing the will to live, a daunting premise even for the bravest voyagers."
"It's possibly the laziest, lamest comedy to come along in awhile."
"As the first hour of ""Suspiria"" grinds into the second and beyond (the movie runs 152 minutes), it grows ever more distended and yet more hollow."
 &#8220;On the Line&#8221; can&#8217;t quite shake the nagging problem of its utterly preposterous scenario&#46;
"You have a film that basically says, 'Eh, what's the big deal?'"
It's acceptably entertaining while you're watching it. But how depressing that Michael Mann should settle for being acceptably anything.
"An utterly embarrassing misfire with poor performances, contrived elements, and a weak premise."
A borderline insufferable session of joke skeet shooting.
"The kind of spectacular failure that requires all participants to be on the same page, working together as one with fevered commitment toward making a disaster, ""The Circle"" couldn't be timelier or more exasperating."
A pretentious and self-indulgent mess.
"That fight comes late in the game, and it's so grim, humorless, and vicious, it stops being thrilling early on. It isn't in the service of any of the themes the film has struggled to express, it's just a meat-headed, brutal throwdown."
Oscar-winning actress Alicia Vikander's attempts at establishing dramatic control over the film are outdone by the naturally goofy atmosphere that any movie like this fosters.
"For those who have ever wondered what might happen if the sadistic billionaire Christian Grey broke his back during an acrobatic sex session and ended up in a wheelchair, a new romcom, Me Before You, bizarrely provides the answer."
The premise suggests it should be a horror movie but instead we are presented with a warped story about high school romance.
"James L. Brooks wrote and directed ""How Do You Know,'' and in addition to forgetting a question mark, he's also misplaced his point."
The semiretired superassassin killed 77 adversaries last time around. The numbers are similar here.
A romantic drama that features sympathetic performances from Dakota Fanning and Elizabeth Olsen that can't overcome the story's general blandness.
"It's no easy task staying awake through Sleepwalking, a downbeat debut from Bill Maher (no, not that one). Only a typically intense performance from co-star Nick Stahl offers the jolt needed to keep us alert."
"It's never less than interesting, that's for sure, but I didn't like it."
To measure up to other superhero films - particularly those of the MCU - it needed to be a lot more focused and substantially more in-depth than it is.
"The story mostly just plods along, enlivened neither by actorly plumage of working-class significance nor by occasional shtick in the style of 'Weekend at Bernie's.'"
"God's Pocket, despite its tiptop cast, fails to sustain its comedy or drama. It becomes, at best, a piece of sardonic anthropology."
"As a promised 'wake-up call,' it's disturbingly sleep-inducing."
"The tonal shifts from unironic romance, to self-conscious grotesquerie, to roaring action don't always flow smoothly, which suggests a film stewed by a few too many hands who weren't always on the same page."
Vin Diesel has seldom been more likable... [but] the movie itself feels like jury duty.
"It's somehow out of sync with its own rhythms and moods, thus its impact is much slighter than might be expected from an idea approached with intelligence and insight by Rebecca Miller and conveyed by as talented a clutch of actors."
The performances are plastic...
"One's interest is diminished as the dramatic focus becomes unclear, petering out in well-meaning rhetorical confusion."
"The Skywalker Saga has been brought to an end, and sadly that was the only goal The Rise of Skywalker seemed to have."
A Good Person doesn&#8217;t manage to find anything new to say about its themes and Braff&#8217;s refusal to break free of obvious cliches brings the whole film down&#46; A Good Person is without a doubt elevated by Pugh&#8217;s performance&#44; but that can only save so much&#46; 
Fire Island feels hemmed in by its source material even when being loose and irreverent with it.
It swears like it's just learned the words and splatters gore everywhere as if it discovered the only crayons left in the box were differing shades of crimson.
I prefer my Ant-Man movies smaller than whatever this was
"Jessica Alba gets plain-Jane crazy for An Invisible Sign, a syrupy A Beautiful Mind redux."
"It seems as desperate to be adored as Jay Gatsby himself, and it's suffocated by delusions of grandeur on a comparable scale."
"Expectations of originality soon cloud over, leading towards the kind of quick ending at 97 minutes which kills any sign of blue sky thinking."
The story is simply a rehash of the first film&#46; While it can be enjoyable&#44; it doesn&apos;t live up to the lightning-in-a-bottle moment of the 1993 film&#46;&#10;&#10;
"This is the worst of Ed Zwick's films... utterly unfocused, trying to shove virtually every White Man In Africa stereotype in the movie book."
The film suffers under a rambling screenplay penned by Chris Fedak...
"What has the passing of almost six decades given us? A fresh take on Ben-Hur that is more noble, dweeby, and neutered than a Sunday school in South Dakota."
"A deliriously pretentious and utterly dreadful movie, Suspiria amounts to an unnecessary reworking of the cult 1977 Italian horror freak-out of the same name."
Comedy is very binary. People are either laughing or their not... If you're in a room where a comedy is playing and nobody is laughing you can hear the lack of space.
A dreadfully depressing screen portrait of a thoroughly obnoxious fiction writer.
This is a step up from several of its predecessors but it still feels like the filmmakers wasted anopportunity to reinvigorate the franchise.
"The film has a big heart sometimes for the victims, and yet the deaths are so sadistic and so brutal... It didn't have the empathy that I thought it should have."
"Tasteless and tedious, this is too dumb to be of any significance."
"Despite a worthy cast and a fun premise, this comedy feels like a missed opportunity."
"There is a fine idea for a romantic comedy in Jake Paltrow's The Good Night but the writer-director, in his debut feature, never develops it much beyond the idea stage."
Draggin' about dragons
"It's all too much for Lee to handle. Jungle Fever is overlong, yet he hasn't found the screen time to give each of these people his or her reasons, and even the Snipes and Sciorra characters slip away from him."
"Lurches along in fits and starts, from funny to embarrassing, from earnest to egotistical, from yuks to yuck!"
Lacks the poignancy that set the first film apart. It apes the National Lampoon formula for humor but seems bereft when it comes to showing dad's desperate love for his brood.
The kind of flick that serves itself up as the object of its own satire.
So what is missing? A little of the original's madness and a lot of its aesthetic high-wire walking.
"The thing that bothers me most about films like ""Those"" is the sense that everyone involved just decided to phone it in."
Mamet-Lite (R).
"This would-be slow-burn horror oversimplifies its dynamics instead, wastes its cast, and stretches its beats to the point where there are no real highs or lows."
One of the laziest rom-com scripts in memory ... the only joy in the film is the way the actors approach each ludicrously silly set piece.
"All in all, this is really tame."
"Risk tries to peel back the facade, but ultimately fails to succeed in giving us anything particularly new or radical."
"Trank's efforts to deviate from the rise-and-fall formula in telling Capone's life is worth noting, but the movie is a bit too shapeless and meandering to make an impact."
"Though a bit of a patchwork in script and production, a glossy, rich green, environment almost makes the picture work."
The movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny Phonce and his several silly subplots.
The Legend of Tarzan falls flat in its storytelling and could benefit from trimming some of the political fat of the story to play on the classical themes of the tale.
"If you edited out all the parts where nothing happens, the running time of this film would be reduced from 114 minutes to 15 minutes."
"It's not a complete waste of time as there are a few magical Chan moments as when he's fighting off and dodging bad guys on the top of a speeding train...Chan, at 62, may not be as nimble as he once was but what he can do is still very impressive."
"A faithful adaptation of a boring, poorly written book. Bring lots of caffeine."
"Messy, dreary and repulsive slick near future sci-fi/film noir thriller that both dazzles and is bombastic."
"It's all meant to be wild and crazy, but somehow it seems simultaneously nasty and dull."
"The movie's lessons are basic and belabored, and its presentation of them is only slightly more sophisticated."
"(T)he equivalent of a nonsexual succubus, slowly sucking out the audience's intellect with each succeeding scene."
"...this is one long dirty joke. In fact, at nearly two hours, it's a very long dirty joke. If only it was funny."
An exercise in excellent acting and little else.
"A curious film: for a purported comedy-thriller, it's not very funny, and it generates remarkably little suspense...Mostly it's a shambling bore."
"There is a lot of talent wasted in August Rush, a would-be weeper that comes across remarkably flat."
"Unresolved issues suggest that the filmmakers were in a rush and the screenplay was left underdeveloped. Ironically, they seem to have run out of time"
An amateurish disaster by director Sam Peckinpah [that] should finally put the Kid out of his misery. It's a veritable death ritual which smothers the love-hate tale of Garrett and Billy under back-to-back slaughters. 
"A few more months in the computer workshop (and okay, the editing booth) could have done wonders for this wacky little movie."
The real problem seems to be a laughably bad script.
Nothing works properly and with genuine conviction in The Last Thing He Wanted. [Full Review in Spanish]
"You have to die a little to catch a glimpse of the depths of hell... or this movie. Bless them Father, for they have sinned."
"We, in any case, are as unconvinced by his lovelorn saga as Deneuve's skeptical pragmatist -- that is, until a romance paperback deus ex machina shoots the film's lifelike credibility out of the water."
"It's a tearjerker where the tears come not from the heart, but from the aching mind; we cry not because of the sad situations, but because of its ludicrous attempts at being sad."
What is intended as haunting and unworldly comes off as stilted and phony. Only the evocative cinematography of Robert Humphreys gives any hint as to what may have been.
A seriously disjointed biopic on Potter's personal and professional life that desperately yearns to be another Finding Neverland but winds up as an anemic nothing of a film.
"It's super- violent, super-serious and super-stupid."
"Despite the class-conscious genre pleasures, independent cinema's foremost Zinn master feels slightly off his game."
"Little of the material feels distinctive, fresh, or insightful -- let alone edgy."
"""Burlesque"" never approaches the naughty complexity of ""Cabaret"" or the precision of ""Chicago."" For director/screenwriter Steve Antin to approach such musical high-stakes without his A-game on is unforgivable."
"It's a journey of self-discovery, rife with movie cliches about believing in yourself, believing in your dreams, yada-yada."
"In ""The Commuter,"" another late-career actioner, Liam Neeson takes his save-the-day shenanigans aboard the 6:25 train to Cold Spring, a bumpy ride on which he must root out bad guys or it's the end of the line for his family."
"As a film, it's curious. It feels like an intermediary story."
"Although it gets off to a decent start, this ""Time Machine"" breaks down when it gets to the distant future, which in this case isn't a good place to be stranded."
The laughs are scattershot.
Moments of visual beauty only call attention to the stilted dialogue and maudlin plot that otherwise define the film.
"It doesn't live up to the first one... but if you're going to watch one of the sequels, this one would be it."
Call Jane would be more effective if it stuck to human drama rather than having its characters make sweeping assertions that sound like stump speeches given at political rallies
"The problem isn't so much in the film's clumsy, hand-holding narration, or in its forced quirkiness. Rather it's that its most interesting character -- the one they named the thing after -- isn't the main character."
A better movie than the first one...which is a little like saying that someone with a terminal illness is better off than a person who's brain-dead.
"If you are a gamer, and like shooters, science fiction, action, and wouldn't consider gratuitous boob shots gratuitous, you won't feel short-changing on leaving the cinema after watching Gamer."
Their title can't reflect what it promises to deliver other than exposing the phenomenon of cinematic monotony; an event more frequent than you could possibly believe.
"A mishmash of fact, fiction and innuendo that sheds little light on Reeves' life or his death."
"The film consists mostly of action and romance, two things Liman does well in his comedies, but rather poorly here."
"More a valentine to Chicago's architecture than the aching love story it purports to be, The Lake House is a slow-moving, never-igniting tale of calendar-crossed lovers that grows less convincing as it proceeds."
"[I Walked With a Zombie] contains some terrifying passages, but is overcrowded with trite dialog and ponderous acting."
"The script is a disaster that, only in the middle of the film, manages to be a little more attractive with a 'the hunter who is hunted' plot twist. [Full review in Spanish]"
Surprisingly few surprises in this classic samurai costumer from Japan's dark iconoclast Takeshi Miike.
The stakes build and build&#44; until they are nonsensical and absurd&#46;
At times the pic doesn't even seem certain which decade it's set in; the squeaky-clean high school environs often feel more '80s than '90s.
"Seeks to be a whimsical premise but, except for a few moments, proves ponderous instead."
"But nothing in this movie clicks, and as a result the tired affair seems to take longer than World War II itself."
"Pleasant, light, tear-jerking entertainment"
"As incredible as it may sound regarding an amnesia thriller, Unknown's plot isn't silly enough to merit where it ends up taking the main character."
To say this script lacks dramatic energy is an understatement - you might as well try to power your car on celery juice.
"The story of Walsch's travails never strains credulity, though helmer Simon's predilection for spiritual vistas with light breaking through clouds, arrested close-ups and endless long dissolves often skirts kitsch."
Made me long for the days when director Zhang Yimou made intimate movies with emotional depth.
"Not as bad as the title might suggest, maybe a bit too dark a comedy for most audiences. However, it still has some comedic blank spots."
"Despite the elaborate trappings of this period piece, particularly the costumes, hair and makeup, the flow of the film goes back and forth between these two rival queens vying for power like a slow, boring chess game."
"It's a film about a supposedly real-world set-up that never feels true, even though the people who made it clearly set out to treat their subject matter and the audience with respect."
"The schematic requirements of the setup, combined with the tight-lipped demeanor of the two lead characters, makes for arid moviegoing. Eighty-five minutes can seem much longer than it really is when you spend the entire time waiting for a shoe to drop."
Wrecked beyond any repair.
If Christopher Reeve were alive he'd be suing for character libel.
"We've seen this film way too many times in countless permutations, and its lack of originality is injured by the general poorness of the direction."
The talents of two otherwise fun and likeable stars have been snatched.
[A]ll the gee-whiz webslinging action in the world can't hide the fact the whole endeavor is the same old crap with a new coat of paint.
'The banality of evil' is a phrase one hears. It doesn't mean that you can represent evil with cliches.
"Even with the original stars returning, the sequel feels weightless, disposable and hardly the stuff of Skynet nightmares."
Too darn long.
"[It's] arguably just a feature-length interpretation of the joke everyone says when a dog jumps up onto a couch: 'Aw, look, he thinks he's people!'"
"An over the top, ham-fisted replay of the original."
...tries too self consciously to connect the old crew to the newer one and never quite makes a smooth transition.
[Ms. Kassell and Mr. Fechter] trick up Walter's character with so many conflicting moods and impulses and then place him within a post-prison society that is itself alternately oppressive and permissive.
"Choosing to clothe his whole movie in the outr frocks of a bad Technicolor romance, Ozon serves up camp fun, but that's it."
"At this stage, Fox should seriously consider either retiring the franchise entirely or giving it a rest before reinvention."
The title's parenthetical plural sums up the problem with Some Girl(s): Five slow-cook dialogues that reveal the nice-guy protagonist as a super-tool is four too many.
"A crude, silly misstep on the part of both Fey and Poehler."
"Sandler doesn't appear to be trying terribly hard, and Gad gets sucked into that humor vacuum, going after laughs with a palpable desperation and adopting Sandler's signature move of yelling for no apparent reason."
What should have been a chance for Guadagnino to mix all his interests into a fascinating&#44; appealing medley turns out to be a bore&#46;
"Technology has reached the point where lower-budgeted CGI films can at least look better than video games, but Leap! still suffers from stiff motion and muted facial expressions. Worse, it has terribly anonymous design."
"A production where the solipsism that's being dissected didn't bleed into the filmmaking. It's the movie that our version of A Glitch in the Matrix, brainy yet immature, started out as, but somewhere along the way, this file got corrupted."
The premise of a 40-year-old man who travels back in time and meets his younger 12-year-old self  is not a theme I found compelling. 
"Steve Carell's pursed-lipped awkwardness and sweet buffoonery are both in fine form, but those endearing qualities aren't nearly enough to salvage Peter Hedges's incorrigibly hackneyed film."
It never effervesces into anything deeply funny.
The film never convinces us that its main characters really belong in this seamy world.
If the first act plays with the very idea of déjà vu ... the rest of the plot ... has an unfortunate and far less engaging sense of the familiar.
This movie ruined me.
"With flat characters, an undeveloped script and only sporadic comedy, we're left in an in-between place where it feels as if nothing is at stake and nothing can be done."
It&#8217;s when DeMonaco begins pounding his pulpit with the subtlety of a sledgehammer that things unravel&#46; At times his dialogue is laughably blunt and his message so brazenly in-your-face that you can&#8217;t help but roll your eyes&#46;
"I believe Jackman has a great musical in him, but it's not here right in front of us now."
The movie is hopelessly bland.
"Appropriately, Tideland ends with a train wreck."
"The best of Underworld: Blood Wars is in the action sequences and not in its story, which has no greater substance. [Full review in Spanish]"
And it ended almost immediately.
[Its good aspects] shame the overriding lack of commitment in finding an assured tone and better jokes.
"A Mexican thriller-with- a-message, brings the message and forgets the thrills."
It's depressing that films like The Klumps pass for seasoned comedy in the beginning of the 21st century.
"If, by chance, you've missed ""Twilight"" and its sequels, don't worry. Shiny, moody, moon-faced and dumb, ""Red Riding Hood"" pretty much replicates the experience entirely."
"With more plot holes than bullet holes, this marksman misses the target."
"I can understand why these unknown child actors were involved with this movie but as for the grown-ups, all I can figure is that they were each fulfilling some kind of community service obligation."
"Although the images from the film are poetic and are more fondly recalled in hindsight, in this case art film for art film's sake doesn't fly very high."
...a near miss that nevertheless fares better than most of Miyazaki's output.
"I've seen enough car wrecks this year, and while this one doesn't take the cake it's still nothing more than a junkyard distraction blindly driving nowhere."
"The Great Gatsby is ultimately an epic tragedy, a parable about America, the American dream ethos and its consequences, but the movie's overblown style chokes the life out of any substance the story may have."
"A tougher work might have seemed provocatively relevant in the tragic context of current events, but this film has a muted nostalgia for the days when bomb-tossing students had easy-to-pronounce names and might grow up to be as cleancut as Robert Redford."
"The film is so fast it is over almost before it begins and so empty-headed it demands little but your inertia. On the way there are moments of weird charm, conjured by the movie's velocity."
"It's like a demo reel for Shimizu, who may be a competent technical craftsman but doesn't show even so much as a desire to tell a story."
"In Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, the director's subject is as blatant and consistent as his cluttered mise-en-scène."
"Just like Cameron's book, it is not an easy lecture.  We must lend our undivided attention to each word and each whisper.  [Full review in Spanish] "
"Kallen's story is interesting and I, quite frankly, expected something better than what we have. The raw materials are all here. They just need a little better management and promotion. Against the Ropes -- a split decision."
"This isn't a very demanding role for Lopez, but she still fails to carry it off. In fact, nothing about this film is convincing. It all feels notably artificial."
"A splashy but slapdash nostalgia trip that, while offering a few good moments, is mostly underthought and overdone."
Brigsby Bear lacks the maturity to portray its subject matter with the depth it requires.
Its originality sucker punches you in the face and you barely have time to recover.
"With the film unfolding in its all-too-familiar multi-stranded way, we are left with the growing impression that a real-life tragedy has been cynically turned into a conventional commercial thriller."
Fails to launch...
"""Is it too much to ask that this be the underwhelming and unnecessary franchise blockbuster we just skip because we know it's not going anywhere?"""
The sheer plethora of silly plot holes and nonsensical moments does sort of ebb away at one's suspension of disbelief.
A reasonably sturdy cop movie undone by terrible visuals.
"""The Desolation of Smaug"" turns to be more of too much of a good thing."
This was the 13th Bond movie and it's possibly the most frivolous in the series to date (it's certainly the most careless).
It&#8217;s meant to be a spotlight on mental health awareness&#44; but is so hamfistedly written that it only spotlights awful parents that ignore red flags the size of a football field&#46;
"This is still a fly-ball, not a home run."
It's not worthless -- Del Toro and Hayek are fun -- but you can do better.
"I've got to be honest here. In the interest of full disclosure, I must confess that I was not entirely awake all the way through."
J&#46;D&#46; Dillard&#8217;s film does a fine job of avoiding the cliches in trying to tell a story of racial progression but feels so concentrated in doing it that it neglects to do the job of generating a real dynamic between its leads&#46;
"Jumper is like a glorified TV pilot from 2005, when supernatural dramas were all the rage. It will make it onto the schedule, but have its legs cut out from under it before the season is over."
...breezy and manipulative...This piece of dating dreck is so sticky sweet and syrupy that one would think they screened Petrie's film at the International House of Pancakes!
"It's throwaway stuff, packed with corny gags about rich French cooking and annoying Gallic manners, in which light relief is offered by the sight of our hero torturing a plumber; think The Whole Nine Yards with cheese."
That was it?
"Despite some astonishing visual sequences, a flimsy script and frankly awful character design ground this film before it can blast off."
It's impossible to see this as Clifford Irving. It's Richard Gere... It's fine when you're doing a Richard Gere movie but you can't be Richard Gere in a true story because Richard Gere doesn'
'Passengers' fails at meeting the expectations of the premise. [Full review in Spanish]
"According to legend, Catherine Zeta-Jones was 15 when this movie was made."
What a waste of one of Hollywood's master actors.
"In the end, Loving Vincent feels more impersonal than other recent (and arguably more truly handmade) animated films, such as The Girl Without Hands or especially My Entire High School Sinking into the Sea."
"It's a tray of Carmela's ziti piled high with cannoli and gabagool, then drenched in espresso and red wine - a waste of its ingredients."
"Ritchie's main interest is trying to reignite his stalled career by cribbing shamelessly from Tarantino, Danny Boyle and many other far more talented filmmakers."
"Instead of sending up the current glut of serial-killer movies, the filmmakers trot out the old slasher tactics."
"Obviously padded, too long on action, and painfully short on irony."
"There's never a dull moment, but there's also never a moment. It never stops. It's a perpetual-motion machine."
"They spend a great deal of time roaring, bleating, squealing and snorting at a very high volume, which is, after a point, too much of a muchness."
The film quickly turns into a dull slog.
"Provides a sympathetic, if gradually unhinged, protagonist, then proceeds to put him through hell for no apparent reason other than because it can."
"The movie we see here, though admirable in parts, is numbing as a whole."
"Hallstrom specializes in middlebrow literary adaptations about quirky communities full of secrets, but he may have gone to Barnes & Noble for inspiration one too many times."
"if there are chuckles to be had along the way, they're the asthmatic, superior kind that Comic Book Guy on ""The Simpsons"" enjoys."
"No one in the cast, not even the great Carol Burnett, makes much of an impression in a film that virtually defines the word 'unnecessary,' but it does manage to pull double duty as one heck of a sleep aid."
"Cheerfully retro past the point of winking at us, through the point of smirking at us, up to the point of pushing back in favor of toxic masculinity."
"After an intriguing setup that takes its time building atmosphere and characters, declining to rush the first death, the film becomes progressively more overwrought and hokey."
The hot streak for Irish animation studio Cartoon Saloon cools with My Father&#8217;s Dragon&#46;
The result looks better than most based-on-a-video-game adaptations&#44; but the storytelling is just as dim as we&#8217;ve come to expect from such material&#46;
Hilary Swank wades through bitchin' plagues and comes out looking hot. Film at 11. DVD at 11:30.
There's a great movie to be made about the history of the circus. Water for Elephants is not it.
"True crime, secret lesbians, Floridian trailer trash, and 80s pop music."
"One day, I feel sure, the rich mantle of charisma will descend upon [Hayden Christensen], but Jumper is not that occasion."
"Not enough rejoicing, too much shouting."
Despite director Kasi Lemmons&#8217; best efforts&#44; it reduces Houston to just another interchangeable name and face with nothing truly special about her&#46;
"Maybe it's time to mandate a preliminary aptitude test for documentarians, just to weed out the uninspired time-wasters."
A laughably inept series of adolescent poses trying to pass itself off as a movie.
"As a sequel to ""Grease"" it's terrible, and as a musical on its own merits, it's absolutely abysmal."
"George Clooney produced and stars in this international spy thriller, which he probably thought of as existential but which registers onscreen as a giant bore."
While David Jung's debut film ticks all of the right genre boxes and works well technically it suffers from simply lacking originality and being another in a rather long list of found footage chillers.
Hiaasen's sense of humor loses something in the translation. What's side-splitting on the page becomes silly on the screen.
A somehow more dewy Shakespeare in Love.
"Dated '80s comedy has strong language, few laughs."
"The film is a well-intentioned throwback... But that can't stop the movie from feeling like a rehash of a rehash, a story covering ground that's already been reimagined in a much more effective way."
"An undercooked, rapidly unravelling script, low-grade production values (is that the best future costume you have?), plodding direction and an apologetically crap ending are not worth the price of a cinema ticket in these belt-tightening times."
Those hoping to see an updated big screen version of Melville's Moby Dick are likely to be left wanting something more significant.
...essentially just one long chase sequence that becomes much too monotonous much too soon.
"In short, avoid Flight/Risk and watch instead Downfall, another 737 Max doc. It at least mentions the stock buybacks..."
"How has this vibrant human firebrand, this unpredictable, leaping, shouting zealot, been transformed into the sheepish, subdued, self-deprecating cypher played by Rourke?"
"A resounding success in the laugh department, but it tries to warm hearts as well, and eventually collapses under the weight of its own sugarplum schmaltz."
"A long, teasing trailer for a film not yet made."
More than a little unrealistic.
"Despite a histrionic outpouring of growls, snorts, yells and re-creations of familiar Belushi shticks, from Jake Elmore to Joe Cocker, Chiklis seems to miss every opportunity to redeem himself."
"The result is a film with some memorable moments but, in the end, not enough fuel in the tank to take it where it's trying to go."
"It's overlong, disjointed, a greatest hits of important moments with inadequate connective tissue, impossible to comprehend without prior detailed knowledge of everything it recounts."
There are few things sadder in life than an unfunny Bill Murray movie. But that's exactly what Rock the Kasbah is.
"A potentially fun premise soon turns into no fun at all in Cop Car, a seriously imagination-challenged low-end action thriller."
"As insultingly cursory as the original, the film suffers from a fractured, sense-shorn narrative that makes huge leaps in logic and almost no attempt to address the complexities and controversies of its genetics storyline."
"In this relatively big-budget production, the director's main anxiety seems to be wrapping up the mystery and selling the project."
What should be an irreverent send-up turns into a glorification of the good old days of toxic masculinity.
The artifice involved in moviemaking is driven home in Full Frontal. With a club.
"Despite a star-studded cast and healthy helpings of sentiment, nostalgia and heart, it's a hollow affair that's content to tell the viewer how to feel rather than earning those feelings through its story and performances."
"Vince Vaughan looks like a killer from the moment we see him, and his silly, hyper-mannered performance doesn't help much."
"This film was written by, directed by, and stars women. But it's the most anti-female film I've seen in quite some time."
"A moment of weightlessness in the eye of the storm is literally and figuratively transcendent. Into the Storm is aware of how to be effective, if only grand blockbusterisms would get out of its way."
"It's a movie for kids, and I suppose they will like it well enough, its pedestrian story notwithstanding."
"Mom might say, ""Well, it's the thought that counts, dear."" But take her to this holiday omnibus, and you'll run the risk of having her think you're as lazy as the movie."
"In the way that certain baseball games become pitchers' duels, some movies are cutting-room battles."
'Cherry's disparate inspirations never congeal into a satisfying whole.
It doesn't have a thought in its head and probably no notion of the corruption at its core.
"Look! It's the inevitable dance sequence where Vince teaches all the elves the lessons of Footloose, because if there's one thing you need on the toy assembly line, it's 'jazz hands.'"
Filled with characters who are more irritating than likable and dialogue that sounds as though it had been lifted from a bad network dramedy.
"Gunn seems unable to decide whether he's making a satirical work or a sick joke and, as a result, he squanders the entertainingly unhinged performances of his cast before copping out with a sentimental happy ending."
"made on a shoestring budget and it shows; bad blend of teenagers, rock music and silly lizard on patently faked sets."
It bears too much resemblance to the detritus jumbled across its frame: patchwork components trying vainly to form a cohesive whole.
"Aims for whimsical, but lands well short of its goal."
"Planning on seeing it? You may well recoil from sports comedies, Bollywood musicals, self-help spiritualists, puns &#8212; even characters with beards &#8212; for the foreseeable future."
"Most of “Thor: Love and Thunder” is a mess, pleased with itself and tonally everywhere. As bad as one of the better “Pirates of the Caribbean” movies, but that’s still pretty horrible."
It's as thought writer and director Peter Berg couldn't face following through what he suggests in the early moments of the film.
&#91;The film&#93; has an intriguing premise that makes you wish the writers had spent more time developing the conflict&#46;
"The filmmakers present the movie as having more depth because it is inspired by true events, but opting for seeing it on a pure fictional level is a far better choice."
Mangold is something of a pseudo-Scorsese.
The actors mechanically repeat a script that wasn't written with originality. [Full Review in Spanish]
"The film fails as a personal diary due to Fleck's unflappable aloofness, and the performance footage is rendered unsatisfying by frequent interjections of expository material or cutaways to seaside B-roll that seems photographed for tourist brochures."
"Overloaded with meandering subplots, greeting-card sentiment and trite filial hangups, It Runs in the Family is as dull and embarrassing as watching someone else's home movies."
One of the most depressing and despicable films I have ever seen.
"Nelson's brutally unsentimental approach ... sucks the humanity from the film, leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle."
"For all its formal élan and gritty location shooting, Sin Nombre is a wearily hollow, morally specious movie."
"Generic, underdeveloped and more silly than scary."
"Earnest emotions can't quite trump an awkward approach in Chris Stokes' followup to 2004's ""You Got Served."""
"[E]ven the assured control Green has of his pastiche of gritty, 70s-cinema realism [isn't] enough overcome the inherent stereotypical melodrama..."
"The Unloved is a promising debut for director Morton, but it's sometimes too sensitive where it should be insightful."
Lucy Punch supplies a high-powered comic energy that makes you mope every time the camera leaves her presence.
"Screenwriter Shauna Cross dulls the edges of her novel Derby Girl, which the skate action and rockin' soundtrack can't disguise."
"The underdevloped Believer has at its core a performance of searing and genuine intensity, yet it also regrettably handles the psychological turmoil of its antagonistic protagonist with kid gloves."
"The skeletal story of The Rover is a case of too much bone, not enough meat."
"Benigni is a talented clown, but Edwards's direction is so clumsy and the script so unfunny that you're more likely to cringe or cry than laugh."
It's watchable because both actors have a good screen presence and bring charm to their roles.
"It's a dim, poorly executed, eccentrically cast film and you'd be better off seeking out Nick Broomfield's 2002 documentary Biggie and Tupac."
Do you have to be sad to be funny? You'll have to sit through a slew of micro-anecdotes and shop talk before you get any answers from this choppy documentary - longer than any decent comic would defer a punchline.
Ridley Scott's worst movie since Kingdom of Heaven...
Recommended for Seth MacFarlane.
"Though overly reliant on quick-cut montages and shots of Cassie running down hallways, writer/director Steve Carpenter delivers some modest thrills alongside the usual teen-horror clichs."
"How to Eat Fried Worms is an innocuous, coming-of-age, 'gross-out' comedy that quickly fades from memory, almost before the final credits roll."
An undoubted oddity that some will find penetrating and others irritating.
A retread and it feels like it.
A film noir so steeped in ugliness it's difficult to enjoy on any level.
"The film offers Tom Sizemore the perfect opportunity to prove himself worthy of a comeback. Alas, he fails spectacularly."
Attacking the intended audience is one of those things that a filmmaker just doesn't do. Jeez!
Even lesser Allen movies are better than a lot of what comes out of Hollywood. But make no mistake: This isn't Woody Allen at his best.
"A spectacular failure, despite further evidence of the director's keen eye and bold cinematic ideas."
The very fact that all gave so willingly of their time and talent to feature in such a grotesque spectacle is sort of endearing.
"A little disappointing, considering how genuinely daring it is."
...an often beguiling piece of computer animation that could nonetheless benefit from a gentler touch.
"What Soderbergh's film wants to say is uncertain: That a prostitute has business problems like everyone else? That her johns seem a pretty sleazy lot? That ""everyone is a critic""? None of these qualify as revelatory."
Catastrophically overdone.
"[Director Michael Apted] has an unfortunate penchant for bland stateliness, and never more so than in Amazing Grace."
"Kelly seemed to have a lot on his mind when he assembled this movie, and it looks as if he put it together thinking it would be his last."
"Beautiful to look at, but it's also at once overly familiar and emotionally confused."
"As Trish declared to Darry in Jeepers Creepers: 'You know the part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid, and everybody hates them for it?' This is littered with those moments."
"The Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program, established by the Allies during World War II to protect European and Asian cultural treasures from destruction, deserves a better movie dramatization than this fumbling prestige project."
"If by some chance you find it on the Movie Channel or Sundance or Cinemax, go ahead...but it's not worth the bucks to go to the arthouse."
"The distinction between actors and special effects shrinks ever further in the video game-turned-horror film Silent Hill: Revelation 3D, which reduces its human players to plastic action figures in tired genre settings."
"Watching The Gentlemen feels like going to your rich, kinda racist uncle's house: Sure, his place looks nice, and he lets you play his PS4, but you'll always be steeling yourself for the next time he says ""colored"" at the dinner table."
What Beautiful Creatures!
"A film whose appeal is almost solely historical, for a multitude of reasons."
"Sometimes shrill, often dull, it has nowhere in particular to go, and it takes far too long not getting there."
"Jim Gaffigan mugs as a dad with two families. A few interesting pieces, but it's basically a TV sitcom version of a British slamming doors farce."
"Yet it's never clear what all of this grimness is actually for, or what the likes of Cho, Riseborough, Bichir, and the others are doing here."
"Spectacularly misconceived, in which the optics of a substandard disaster movie are discomfortingly applied to this unfathomable tragedy."
Instead of eliciting a moving or joyous response it feels somewhat off-putting. And that certainly could not be what Maras or Collee had in mind.
"The film is, quite literally, loathsome on every level -- cruel, vulgar, mean-spirited, ugly to look at and ugly at heart."
One of the funniest bad movies ever made.
"Penn stalks through The Gunman with pinched dyspepsia, looking as if he can't wait to punch someone in the nose"

"This is a bad movie, and the people who made it should feel bad."
"We thankfully seem to have exhausted our Tarantino imitators up here, but apparently they're still at work south of the border."

"A starchy, overpowering helping of red, whiete and blue kitsch served up with piping-hot bombast."
"Some laughs, but more iffy stuff in TV-based action comedy."
"... doesn't explore the way teens process grief in the social-media age with much depth or genuine insight, instead softening the character edges and settling for predictable yanking at the heartstrings."
"There's no tension, no sense of consequence. It's all just raw vicarious fantasy for minds I'd rather not have at my Thanksgiving table."
This is one of those rare and very frustrating movies that plays as if every third scene was left on the cutting room floor.
Wrath of the Titans is the visual equivalent of white noise. I don't think I watched it so much as I just looked at it.
"Like In the Mood for Love, 2046 is gorgeous through and through, intoxicating even, but not necessarily in a good way."
A convoluted plot and constant exposition dumb down this live action Pokemon film to a level that even kids will find silly.

A photo essay with moving pictures: anthropological snapshots of seven Salvadoran and Guatemalan skaters...[also] may be [Larry Clark's] most immature film.
"The Tourist has all the hallmarks of a sleekly diverting Euro-thriller, and sets about proving that hallmarks are not enough."
"Despite some funny antics along the way, the viewer feels like an outsider looking in at people who are clearly having more fun than we are watching them."
"My Father Die may boast a bizarrely graceless title, but that's the least of this revenge saga's shortcomings, which number in the dozens and conspire to make it an early contender for worst of 2017."
"They're all clearly having fun, though that's not the same as making a movie."
"Handsome Devil might be the straightest gay film in the history of cinema; its characters may be queer, but the filmmaking certainly isn't."
"Is there any role that Mary Lynn Rajskub can't make strange? I mean, delightfully and eloquently strange?"
Scenes are thrown helter-skelter serving to confuse rather than clarify.
"A fantastic cast doing fine work can't make this feel-good hokum believable, and most viewers who walk away satisfied are those who'd happily watch any new Plummer vehicle, just to celebrate the actor's enduring vitality and charm."
Clark's CGI-induced rugrat romp is about as inspiring in its hilarity as a diaper rash. Exceedingly nonsensical and...excuse the intended pun-infantile
Message to Melanie Griffith and those who would cast her: Griffith does not look believable holding or firing a weapon of any kind. It doesn't work. Stop doing it.
"The real fate of the 9th Legion may never be known, but I'm sure whatever happened to them was more interesting than this movie."
"If you leave after the first 20 minutes, you'll see a great nude scene and a harrowing plane crash without being subjected to the after-school special about alcoholism that comes later."
"A deeply racist movie, though clearly none of the filmmakers thinks so... By the picture's end, we are asked to grasp electrocution as in some way an act of benevolence."
"Particularly repulsive to many Lone Ranger fans may be the way the script, in the film's overly long second half, appears to denigrate American history."
"Winter's Tale is the kind of really bad movie that may still be quite easy to like, or even love, if you abandon all senses ye who enter here."
"At some point it becomes exactly the big, boneheaded movie it was making fun of in the first place."
"Catch and Release is a perfectly likable romantic tragi-comedy, and therein lies the problem. If the essence of drama and comedy is conflict, what do you get when you wash the conflict away in an effort to make everybody 'likable'?"
It jumps from one path to the next without any sense of continuity.
"It is, indeed, what a moviegoer should expect from a genre in which an ensemble cast of famous, pretty faces is loosely strung together by an innocuous holiday or, in this case, baby-having."
"Clever casting and top-notch effects can't fix a pandering, mass-audience-appeal script that refuses to let the Spirit of Vengeance fully out of his bottle."
"Ultimately, the movie plays like a bullet-point argument for a thesis."
"Many rounds are spent in this film, a few cars explode, and Gina Rodriguez becomes a version of The Punisher by the end, which feels like a set-up for an even more absurd sequel. Do yourself a favor and stream or rent the original."
"Only when the protagonists' lives are at stake - and bombs drop - does the piece truly come alive, with a sense of much-needed urgency."
Unfinished Business will seem woefully familiar to most anyone who's been to a movie theater - or taken a long plane ride - over the past 10 years.
"More often than not, ""12 Strong"" feels like a sports movie, where all the stakes rest not on matters of honor and duty, but on a single field goal."
"To make a bad situation worse, Linklater softens the edges of the novel, reducing the film to a laundry list of rich-white-people problems."
"The Hart story is amazing, but the dramatic recreation doesn't do enough to grasp the finer points of character and disgrace."
It&#8217;s a romance with a faux emotional connection that&#44; on screen&#44; frankly&#44; has not been earned&#46;
"Works pretty well as unintentional amusement whenever it goes completely insane. Unfortunately, it's mostly just inane, and that's not much fun."
"This is an anti comedy, the kind of film that will make an entire generation wonder why we ever bothered making hand puppets into full fledged creatures."
"Unforgettable is a ""How Not To"" guide for romantic thrillers, passionless and without tension when it comes to the conflict at hand."
&#91;Millie Bobby Brown&#93; retains the same charming personality in Enola Holmes 2 and she&#8217;s fun to watch&#46; Except for this time&#44; her appearance alone isn&#8217;t enough to save this bloated sequel&#46;
"A haphazard assemblage of recycled parts from other, better horror movies."
"There's lots of mixed film stock and screeches on the soundtrack (as in the credits for ""Seven""), but this gets annoying, as do the predictable twists."
The horror relies on special effects so obvious that the scares are compromised.
It's sad to see the director of The Right Stuff and The Unbearable Lightness of Being reduced to this.
"If there's an original moment in this tedious drama, I must have been rubbing my eyes for a nanosecond and missed it."
"It's all very juvenile, yet there's a level of imagination one wouldn't expect from such fluff. It's the sort of visionary immaturity that bridges generations."
"Instead of shocks, we get moments of tension, suspense and violence between stretches of running scared. Nothing wrong with that, except that the stretches are awfully long in places. And in the end, it all comes to not much."
"An elegant, if slightly dull film, that tries to bring something new to the Twilightized vampire genre, but staked by flawed storytelling."
"The movie is not only anti-capitalism but anti-society, and, indeed, anti-God."
"It's a well-executed survival story, but it misses the chance to amount to anything more."
"Built like a mashup of the Toy Story franchise and the Backyardigans TV series, the UglyDolls movie is unlikely to completely wow anyone in the audience."
"It's tempting, one must admit, to mangle the title of Woody Allen's latest trifle and let it stand as a review. To wit: Pooper Scoop."
"In this ditzy whirl nothing is pushed too far -- the bad aren't really bad, they're all sorry. And the assumption that high school is where it all happens is ringingly endorsed."
Inevitability of the plotting and lack of modulated rhythm make the 97-minute running time feel longer than it is.
You have to grant the cast some praise for not letting such a thing as pointlessness or redundancy get in the way of having a good time.
"Hubie Halloween is barely a movie. It's more like watching a bunch of sketches that didn't make it into the final cut in other movies, strewn together."
Perplexes as much as it entertains with a strong left of centre ideology clashing with the conservative roots of its action western genre.
The special effects are pretty good and the fight scenes are adequate. But the film loses steam in the fourth act ...
"Stone's attempt to break new ground with stylized visuals, MTV editing and a story that combines parody and satire, is more annoying than enlightening."
Maybe Adam Sandler isn't so bad after all.
"The mother's love affair is key, but the movie belongs to Elvira. Leonor Watling brings warmth to this neurotic creature that makes her shine, even in the midst of chaos."
Though it has redeemable elements... something happened along the way and the film gets lost. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Laconic and very stilted in its dialogue, this indie flick never found its audience, probably because it's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters."
"Jason Sudeikis completes his 2011 dude-comedy trilogy with A Good Old Fashioned Orgy, a genial film of good old-fashioned humorlessness."
"In I Do...Until I Don't, it's hard to tell who's being lampooned and who's being treated with sincerity at any given point."
The script... is a disaster that recycles notions but does not achieve the same emotionality... [Full review in Spanish]
"I wish this film was a little lighter and had more lyricism to it, but it's pretty stage-bound and doesn't add up to a lot."
"Stallone is so artificial, tanned and leathery you could replace his mouth with a zipper and sell him as a pocketbook."
"Don't get me wrong, the acting isn't great, the plot simple and the constant 3D effect attempts are annoying as hell, but... it was still... alright, I guess?"
"The film's weird, thin politics become harder to swallow as it lurches from set-up to set-up."
"The Founder ends up feeling extremely wishy-washy, unable to scrub the nastiness of Kroc's success but also incapable of confronting it."
"This is a movie that can't say no to a melodramatic opportunity, and whatever verisimilitude inspired Paul Kimatian and Christopher Gambale to write a script based on Kimatian's memories of the gangs has been utterly lost along the way."
"Despite the escalating ridiculousness, Non-Stop remains passable escapism until it runs headlong into a ""Can I get real for second?"" climax."
"A snappy start gives way to an unfocused second half, which devolves into a walking tour of indie-film clichs that make the 80-minute run time feel overlong."
"Overall, BAD EDUCATION is serviceable, but it could have been given a boost with more substance from its side plots."
"I guess, in the vein of all Disney classics, it says that the little guy can triumph over the big ones -- in this case, a floppy-boobed, badly drawn, crazy woman who rides a jet engine through the bayou."
"Sanctimonious and slow-paced, it's 111 ponderous minutes of retribution and, eventually, forgiveness."
After a fast start it runs out of ideas and energy.
"I disliked this movie so much that, figuring I must have missed something, I went and saw the darn thing again -- it was even worse the second time."
"The film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show: hastily written, underrehearsed, arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo."
"Cornack's Butt Boy is a boring character and the movie is slow and nasty. It's a little reminiscent of Jonah and the Whale, but decidedly more disgusting."
"Yes, as an Indian critic, I can confirm that Brie Larson's film is unbelievably and insultingly racist."
"Stranded in a dull-looking house, and with little action, Pogue's film gets bogged down in conversation and cod-scientific mumbo jumbo."
As artless as it can be--and as thuddingly predictable about the baby's parentage and whom Bridget will end up with--even grumps will admit to scattered amusing bits...and the likeability of Zellweger and Firth.
"What should be breathless and urgent is instead polite and listless: if you can't ignite sparks from an illicit bathroom assignation, then maybe espionage just isn't your thing."
"Dragonfly has no atmosphere, no tension -- nothing but Costner, flailing away. It's a buggy drag."
"Armageddon, as directed by Michael Bay, doesn't give a hoot about making a deep, humanistic impact on us. Or even a shallow one."
"Unfunny, unnecessary and with unlimited box office potential, 'Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian' is all show and no go."
"For all its brooding atmosphere and visual poeticism, the film offers a perspective on the lives of its characters that feels narrow and superficial."
"Kindred ... uses its horror tropes to touch upon noteworthy subjects. Disastrously, though, this is quickly abandoned in favour of quick thrills that generate little payoff."
"Burstein or an apologist would probably say that in the YouTube era, overt and even manipulative mediation is a fact of teen life, and that her movie is a reflection of that reality. If so...YouTube is better at being YouTube than American Teen is."
It's difficult to understand how Jackson could have gone so far wrong with his conception of the material.
"Other than some pretty good set design and special effects, there was nothing new of value in this version."
laughable and immature
This high-profile slow-boiling story of connection and unusual romance walks to its own beat for sure&#44; just not one I liked or would prefer to revisit again&#46;
"After this second assignment, Johnny's licence to thrill has been revoked."
"Since we suspect that the premise will wimp out on any real follow-through, there's no one to care for, nothing to worry about."
"Attention, Goth-club owners: Here's a movie you can throw up on your video screens for a guaranteed two hours of cheap atmospherics."
"To paraphrase Julie Andrews (and maybe Emily Blunt?) as Mary Poppins, Debbie's plan is practically perfect in every way -- which helps explain why the movie is anything but."
"A bummed-out, unfunny Lewis seems to be the main selling point for this dreary drama."
"How this ever got released is a mystery. Unwatchable, almost unreviewable, this stupid monster movie makes the Bela Lugosi swan song Plan 9 from Outer Space look like a masterpiece."
The Blues Brothers is a joke that went too far.
It gives a big-screen face to an American culture generally relegated to the margins of mainstream movies. Too bad it belabors as many stereotypes as it challenges.
A film that might have made its points more convincingly if its makers hadn't felt obliged to underline and spell out at length every one of those points.
"Really little more than a boys' adventure tale done in a style more gruesome than most...too intense and nasty to be sheer dumb fun, and too silly and formulaic to be taken for a serious historical epic."
There is no good time for a movie like Death Wish.
"Fans will compare it to Pulp Fiction or The Usual Suspects, but it's more like one of their knockoffs, glib enough to be diverting and nothing more."
Creepy is the sort of film that will appeal to the sort of viewer who enjoys deeply unpleasant suburban nightmares with vaguely defined psychological underpinnings.
"Shallow performances, script and direction mute the laughs and the insights in a movie that ultimately doesn't have much to say."
"Nothing more than chicken soup for international humanitarian crises, an opportunity for Hollywood types to decry the bloody stone trade while reaching for a little Oscar gold."
It's the kind of thing that only really worked when it was Gremlins.
"The director Stéphane Brizé does some lovely work with non-chronological flashbacks and flash-forwards, but the deadening sense that we know exactly where this is going (hint: not up) is never quite undone."
Too exhaustingly blunt to be as funny as it clearly believes itself to be.
"If, according to the film, everyone has their hands on India, direcctor Gurinder Chadha similarly has her hands on the American box office."
I suggest a plan: Why not try flushing this movie down the toilet to see if it also grows into something big and fearsome?
"Once you get past the central conceit, Helgeland's plotting slips into a rut."
"Miles Ahead has attitude to burn, but the riffs it plays on the trumpeter's life prove as frustrating as they are fascinating."
"An endless NASCAR race trapped in a neverending circle, going round and round and round for eternity with no beginning and no end."
"This much-hyped and eagerly awaited film has lots of dazzle, lots of talent, great new songs, gorgeous costumes....and is totally empty at its core."
"It's a satire of the election process and it also lampoons we the people ... you know, us voters."
Black Nativity is a cut-rate musical melodrama that grafts overreaching references to black culture onto a facile family-values narrative.
"Not helping the cause is the effort's glacial pacing, which is meant to conjure a special sense of agitation, but doesn't get the feature where it needs to be in terms of unease."
Much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad.
"Might be a shallow, even irresponsible biography, but it's a pretty impressive technical exercise. The individual view can decide for themselves whether this is good enough."
"As a debut feature I might have let it off with a middling review, but as a follow-up to a far better feature, this just doesn't pass muster."
Bekmambetov's visual attack and brand of action make me urp. But he's a sincere merry hack.
"A paint-by-numbers affair that is not only tired, but looks as if it was written by a computer program."
It's a brainless joyride that ends up spinning its wheels in macho clichés.
"Too often a film fails on its ability to skillfully write, portray or act out a compelling story, but its redeeming savior is expensive special effects. Viewers deserve the total cinematic package and they don't get it here."
A TV movie. How did Loretta Divine not kill these writers?
"the actual Transformers action in Transformers: Dark of the Moon looks great and should please those who enjoy the format. Getting there, however, transforms what should be a brisk set-up into a long haul."
... the extreme levels of gratuitous gore also make the picture ... difficult to recommend.
"The issue of how men in power treat women brings the film into the here and now all the more robustly, but the tone is hectoring and opportunistic, with none of the true pop of American politics."
"Really strives to sneak in commentary about military industrial complex and the war on terror, but it's barely able to stack up to Verhoeven's original, when all is said and done."
"...this repetitious and self-indulgent hodgepodge comes across as a nostalgia-drenched vanity project, with far too much footage of various celebs at assorted gatherings introing Moore as the greatest thing since sliced bread."
"If not for some inspired moments of breathtaking beauty and heartfelt performances, it would just be one of those tired love stories that you quickly forget."
An aimless chore to sit through in desperate need of a human pulse and a shot of adrenaline.
None of the stars in this dopey rip-off of the Chevy Chase series deserves to be in this.
"Barely passable popcorn, but highly flawed as a serious drama."
Stylish sci-fi visuals aren't enough to keep The Signal from collapsing under its own emo poetics and landing in a dead zone.
"Intriguing but severely flawed, this anatomy of the enduring appeal of the Old West myth owes its existence to Ford, Hawks, Bogdanovich, Larry McMurtry, and Sam Shepard"
For filmmakers as prolific and politically potent as the Dardennes&#44; it&#8217;s frustratingly business as usual&#46;&#10;
"Take away the shock value, and there isn't much there: just a stylistically promising student film peddling bargain-basement surreal nihilism that, stretched over 90 minutes, grows awfully tedious."
"Vapid, lengthy, and mostly lifeless -- kind of like the desert it's named for."
A sorry and misguided rehash of Robert Penn Warren's famous 1946 novel.
Cold and uninvolving.
"It's fraught with frenetic energy and delightfully charming performances, but Blithe Spirit is not as funny or absurd as it sets out to be."
"Małgorzata Szumowska’s disaster movie, based on a true story, relies too heavily on tropes and not enough on its star, Naomi Watts."
"Starting Out in the Evening has the feeling of a film in which the actors, left to direct themselves, played into their own self-indulgent instincts, and the only one who resisted was the old pro who knew better."
The film finally succumbs to its own abstraction with an ending that satisfies neither symbolism nor wish fulfillment.
"Woody Allen's Take the Money and Run has some very funny moments, and you'll laugh a lot, but in the last analysis it isn't a very funny movie."
"Kubo and the Two Strings is a visually dazzling film set in an ancient, magical Japan. And now, the bad news. As a narrative, Kubo and the Two Strings is nearly incomprehensible."
The mix of real sex and fake-looking violence in this 2000 French feature is curiously unprovocative.
Only the deadpan delivery of Timothy Olyphant as Agent 47 enlivens the wooden dialogue of this collection of clichs masquerading as a silver-screen adaptation.
"The Nutcracker and the Four Realms might be visually beautiful, but the film's story falls apart, and the characters are uninteresting with murky motivations."
"By the film's final third, you begin to wonder when, or if, it is going to reach a conclusion."
"While the prospect of watching Miss Hawn play a rude, nasty socialite is appealing, and even the transformation to homebody is a funny idea, Overboard winds up taking things too far."
"Features some of the least interesting characters in the world, complaining about their problems in a way that makes you stop wondering why people think Gen Xers do nothing but whine."
Helen Mirren and John Hurt clearly need to stop saying 'yes' to any old shit that may or may not save the British film industry.
"I don't mind having my heartstrings pulled, but don't treat me like a fool."
"Jenkins ... is obviously capable and sensitive. Is there nothing she finds more pressing, perhaps more tragic and profound than the stories she has recounted so far?"
"An instantly forgettable film, notable only for its contribution to a disturbing slide in cinematic morality."
"It's not as bad as you might think, but the fade-to-black that precedes the final credits brings with it the now traditional dull sadness for that lost Allen era in which all this was great."
Despite so many characters - including a wealth of Japanese officers - there's no emotional connection to any of the cookie-cutter personas.
Francois Ozon's quiet sexual drama raises more questions than it answers.
"At a time of fine teen comedies such as Mean Girls and Freaky Friday, the real mystery was why this was made at all."
"While the movie is harmless, it lacks a certain spark to be really entertaining. Lots of the jokes are flat and obvious, without being awful."
"The biggest mystery that hangs over “Nurse""... is the question of why all these power players thought something this slight, this weightless, this forgettable was ever worth their time."
"Filmmakers have the power to change reality on us at their whim, but if they do so in ways that make us feel tricked and cheated, then this is an unforgiveable rip-off."
"Characters -- Vampire and Lycan alike -- pose, strut and try to look menacing, but they're as scary as a congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses."
While the effort to make a film during the pandemic must be commended&#44; the static images and dull conversations give us nothing to latch on to&#46;
An idea and cast that should be great doesn't have enough laughs to get through all of the annoyance.
"It's dumb, but it's fun, and it doesn't pretend to be otherwise."
"A shameless two-hour trip of lousy character interaction, daisy-head romance, anti-conclusions and disconnected human logic."
"There's a great movie somewhere inside Touchy Feely desperately trying to swim to the surface, but its obscurity also comes with an inarticulateness that robs it of its potential."
"With a rather dour and bleak tone hanging over the entire film, 'Storm Boy' proves to be a rather pointless and disappointing experience."
It's easy to like the idea of a Jack Reacher movie; it takes a little more effort to like the one writer-director Christopher McQuarrie (who penned 'The Usual Suspect's) has made.
A mechanical period romance sandwiched between a dimensionless legal drama&#44; Where The Crawdads Sing is only accidentally interesting if you know the controversy surrounding its author&#44; Delia Owens&#46; 
More like redundant.
"My Boyfriend's Back is obviously aiming for the subversive high school yuks of 1989's Heathers, but the story line never bothers to make sense."
The cinema is filled with great and small examples of angsty young men struggling to find their way in life and Gerster doesn't bring anything innately new to the table.
"There is too little levity and cleverness afoot, especially with a cast whose talent is barely tapped."
"Despite a novel premise and an appealing, energetic cast, Full Of It seldom finds magic in its supernatural whimsy."
"Teetering between weirdly mesmerizing and inexplicably clumsy, D.J. Caruso's film offers a worthy investigation of voyeurism, as it pervades current popular culture in the form of reality TV and user-generated internet videos."
"See Britney wiggle her ass. See Britney skimp around in a pink bra and undies. Okay, remind me again why this movie is any different than watching Britney Spears in real life?"
This Americanized remake of a 2002 Japanese horror film can't make up its mind whether to be a drama or a thriller.
"It has very little of [Moulin Rouge]'s irreverence or nose-thumbing spirit, opting instead for a stubborn adherence to the tenets of the budget-busting Hollywood prestige pictures of the 1950s and 1960s."
"No less then seven screenwriters contributed to the script, which has its powerful moments but so deifies Silveira that the movie turns into a black-and-white struggle between a caring, enlightened woman and a cadre of hard-hearted, benighted men."
"A hyper violent, run of the mill crime drama!"
"With ""Bewitched,"" Nicole Kidman's career slips down yet another rung after her recent cinematic mishaps with ""The Stepford Wives"" and ""Birth."""
"If ever there were a venue in this region in dire need of Prince dropping by, this is it. These Twin Cities folks desperately need to swap NPR for the NPG."
"A lot of it's funny - for instance, any scenes involving Powell's admittedly charming Finnegan or Hoechlin's testy McReynolds - but hanging out with these guys eventually becomes a chore."
"I don't expect Outlaw King to be 100% or even 50% historically accurate. But I do expect it to be interesting, and time and again the movie opts for the simplistic rather than the complex."
Does a great job of masking how little it has to say about the bloodshed it deals in.
"If Honey were three minutes long, and had no dialogue, it'd be completely entertaining."
"Not even thrill-starved movie audiences are likely to be bound by this ""Spell."""
"The mere concept of Hancock, as the newly liberated widow of the title, clambering around Scottish mountainsides might be enough to sustain a trailer, but it doesn't go the distance here."
"When Snatched lands a joke, which it does from time to time, it garners big laughs. The movie just isn't consistently funny, despite some bright spots."
"Lacks imagination, story, good acting and a reason for being."
This banana-brained picture doesn't deliver. Parents will prefer shuttling everyone to a second showing of WALL-E.
Blockers' approach... is so old-fashioned that its makers - [debut director] Kay Cannon and screenwriters Brian and Jim Kehoe - took advantage of political correctness to update it. [Full review in Spanish]
"For someone who became famous for his daring attitude, Rock seems strangely determined to be as formulaic as possible here."
"...a bloated, incoherent mess that may divert children (and grown-ups who enjoyed playing with the toys) who have turned the last three films into international hits."
"There's anger but no insight in ""Vice,"" a glib portrait of Dick Cheney that preaches to the choir but becomes less persuasive as it goes along."
"It's bad enough that the movie is about uninteresting people's problems. What's worse is that it's about snobs, and Baumbach buys into their snobbery."
"No one seems to know what the movie is about; is it about the friendship, Thomas's life and women, or the war?"
My cup runneth over with tedium during this 2 1/2-hour supernatural slog.
"To watch this film is to gain a new level of identification with HAL 9000: as MORTAL INSTRUMENTS unspools before your eyes, you can feel your mind going...going...gone - until you find yourself humming a verse of ""Daisy Bell."""
There are just too many sweeping stereotypes here to take aim at and I simply don't have the time nor will to live to bother.
Country Strong weak in the story department.
"[S]omewhat involving, but mostly contrived, drama..."
"This is as unambitiously amiable a timekiller as you might expect from Live Nation Productions, a logical extension of the Coens' penchant for being deeply invested in popular American music history that otherwise sheds no light on their previous work."
None of the frights or special effects is any great shakes.
High school theater spoof lacks some spark.
It is one of the most relentless movies I have ever seen. It just refuses to end.
What happened is impactful. All my respect for broaching the subject. But the way it's told doesn't grab me. [Full review in Spanish]
"The Paperboy is southern Gothic wallowing in the swamp of low camp. And if the wallowing were deliberate, this might have been hugely funny."
"What Time Code perhaps proves most of all is that the digital filmmaking revolution means absolutely nothing without an old-fashioned, compelling story to hang it on."
A Porter biography that makes Porter's songs sound flat and undistinguished is on the wrong track.
Can't hang with the pros.
"This is a stark example of what movies have become, which is intellectual diarrhea...there is no acting...just one ridiculous fight after another between and among people who are more or less invulnerable. But, get used to it. This junk makes money."
"Plenty of costumes, but not much drama."
A waste of time. [Full review in Spanish]
"It's a film that's easy to agree with and applaud for its craftsmanship, but often a chore to actually watch"
"How does that writer take a whack at that franchise, and come up with something as convoluted and puffy as this?"
"Non-Stop reaches for some pointed post-9/11 political commentary that almost entirely exceeds its grasp. Total brainlessness, in this case, would have been a virtue."
...another complete and total misfire from the once-reliable Adam Sandler...
"Five minutes into this eye-crossingly dull drama, you wonder not just what is going on, but why on earth you should care. (The short answer: You should not.)"
An exhausting succession of dramatic happenings that leave little room for periodic small wins.
"I Am Number Four runs a bit like this: OK, OK, ho-hum, yawn, YAY WOW! ... meh."
Altogether inferior to Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds.
"A sultry, pretty thing with a few good ideas: in other words, stuck in limbo."
"While Magic Mike’s Last Dance is certainly entertaining, thanks to returning director Steven Soderbergh, there’s no escaping how aimless the film feels in comparison to what came before."
"Basically ""The Will Ferrell Show,"" with the second-stringers relegated to the sidelines, fighting for scraps."
"""How Do You Know"" is a complete misfire from famed writer/director James L. Brooks."
"It was supposed to be a comedy, but it just wasn't funny. End of story."
High camp.
"Ultimately, ""The Goldfinch"" feels like a series of often-elegant moments, in service to a story that never quite comes into focus."
"Utterly dull thriller ""Drone"" tries to raise ethical and moral questions about modern warfare, but the audience can only dwell on the illogical plot and unsympathetic characters - if they can engage at all."
I wish I could forget it!
"There's howlingly awful and then there's ""The Assignment,"" a thoroughly ridiculous, numbingly slow neo-noir thriller about a low-life hit man forcibly given gender reassignment surgery by a vengeful doctor."
"Even with all the four-letter words, this still feels like immature kids' stuff."
"Secondhand Lions tries to delight, but its charms are no more credible than the swashbuckling adventure that Caine's character recounts."
"Soderbergh does demonstrate again here that he's a gifted director, however unwise in his choice of project."
"""The Cold Lands"" is aimless and dull, but has a rich tone and upstate authenticity."
"A tiresomely sarcastic maturation adventure, in which actors like Holly Hunter and Octavia Spencer renege on their goodwill."
"""Moxie"" tackles everything from bullying, rape, and diveristy awareness in a tidy, easily digestible PG13 package, but the razor-sharp edge (and satirical element) that Amy Poehler tries to facilitate never finds its apex."
"The film works best early on...watching how the young, ambitious college drop-out uses his wits and his wiles to develop an exciting idea and bring it to life."
"The film, scrupulously faithful to its source, is decidedly literary, but not in an especially satisfying way."
Solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke
"Ultimately the film can only dream of having the magic, personality and charm of the Tim Burton efforts it so obviously plagiarises"
"A well intentioned, fat liberation movie that is grounded in clichs and has after-school TV special written all over it."
"The Man is so slapdash that two major characters are revealed to be the same person, a move prompted more by budgetary concerns than clever scripting."
All the excitement of a wet weekend in Bognor.
"Even the more attention-grabbing scenes are too obviously faked to build suspense, and too confusingly cut to sustain continuity."
"Lawrence remains a sympathetic focus throughout, and ""Joy"" never completely loses its way. But it almost does, and it never quite arrives."
A listless but lustrously shot biopic...
Satire about hooking up in the digital age misfires.
It's City Slickers with horses and cattle replaced by motorcycles and a lot of gay jokes. The celebration of conformity is where its aura of laidback inclusiveness is revealed as a pose.
"Scripturally messy, medically problematic."
Nanjiani and Rae are certainly funny and charming enough to carry a movie. That doesn't mean they should have to.
"Doesn't have much of an emotional, or even physical center, cursed as it is with a storyline that wanders as aimlessly as its characters."
"Both crushingly pretentious and oddly silly--rather like the cinematic equivalent of Jack Handey's 'Deep Thoughts,' but without the saving grace of intentional humor."
"Visit ""Suburbicon"" at your own risk."
The saddest thing about this flotsam is how much money it pulled in.
"Lost in the music, mustaches, and furniture of the early '70s, this docudrama of a porn star's exploitation isn't nearly painful enough."
Embalmed in a thick oil of expansive inoffensiveness.
"Unfortunately, the script is so horrible and the characters so distinctly unlikable, we are rarely as connected to the action as we really should be."
It also exchanges the police subplot that gave the earlier film its steady pace for a lot of pointless backstory about the mother-fixated stalker.
"Suspect Zero has two good ideas, and it squanders them both."
Too broad for the tarmac.
Happy Christmas is a pleasant-enough quick watch that's easy to digest. And that's also what makes it somewhat disappointing.
"Wood's story-world details are rendered beautifully, but without a framework to hang them on"
"Too often, the film props up caricatures and constructs in its superficial gloss on history."
"Mr. & Mrs. Smith will prove a long, hard slog for filmgoers who don't think that simply gazing at Pitt and Jolie constitutes a fun night out."
"Buster's Mal Heart loses confidence as it proceeds, resulting in a journey of half-formed ideas that could've used as much focus as Malek's dead-eyed glance."
"The Circle is a movie that is emotionally dead, intellectually vapid, and otherwise just dull. It doesn't even have the decency to be so bad that its failing is amusing."
Ghostbusters: Afterlife leans so heavily on the I.P. of Ghostbusters... The nostalgia bait was just to the movie's detriment.
Good acting&#44; beautiful scenery&#44; so so story that never involves the audience like it should&#44;
Babylon is a ghastly&#44; sticky&#44; indulgent mess of a movie&#44; slinging shock value in lieu of anything interesting to say&#46; 
There's a nifty little spy thriller secreted somewhere in this bloated picture.
"My attention was held for the first act or so. Then any attempt at realism was abandoned, and it became clear that the house, and the movie containing it, were devices to manufacture methodical thrills."
"It's enjoyable, consistently beautiful, fairly conventional, occasionally surprising and ultimately disappointing."
"His hipster doofus is a complete character he's created to win over girls, and there's not really anything sincere or real about it. His sad sack loser in The Baxter is so annoyingly emasculated that it didn't feel honest, ever"
"Unfortunately, it's also not very good. Especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie."
"Labaki never claimed to be Noël Coward, but the facile comedy leads to a dilution of the message she strives so strenuously to make."
"As the plot rolls inexorably-and tediously-on, the movie becomes more and more a cluttered, overstuffed CGI mess."
"Vice is a hollow, indecisive, and unconvincing biography, so emerged in jokes and structural gimmickry that it doesn't figure out how to judge its subject."
"In pursuit of prestige, it loses the qualities that make the story worth telling."
"You can't play R-rated savagery for laughs (often very funny and very bloody laughs, it should be said) for the first two acts, and then take it seriously once the imminent mob cleanup squad arrives in town, gunning for Fred and his family."
Valiant never takes flight. This Disney animated war film is dull and ugly.
"A remake of Luc Besson's 1998 French comedy , film is terribly contrived, under-written and almost desperate in its attempt at humour.**"
"By all accounts, Miss Crawford had serious failings as a mother, but the film pounds so unrelentingly on her raging cruelty to her children -- and her equally offensive public sweetness -- that she emerges as a laughable caricature."
An embarrassingly murky mess that takes something that could've been made into agreeably cheeseball fun and sucks all the fun out of it.
"As with Burton's puzzling run of recent films, the actual business of telling a story seems not terribly important to him."
It's unfortunate that a movie about the intoxicating allure of the highest-quality spirits leaves you feeling so stone-cold sober.
"I myself growled and whimpered like an abused canine after a couple of hours of this sub-Lassie silliness, though the film threw me the occasional choc-drop in the form of a gag."
"Although the intent of director Robert Redford is likely a cautionary one, the result feels a bit like being told something we already know."
"The first scene/shot ends, and so, too, does the movie's attempt to do anything inventive with its tale of history."
"Imagine if Jonathan Swift had penned a sequel to A Modest Proposal where you couldn't tell if he was serious about cannibalism. That's Kick-Ass 2, a weird, fake satire. LET THEM EAT BABIES. I THINK."
"Quinn and Williams almost make ""Wedding"" worth seeing, but it's not enough to save a film that feels more like a second rate soap opera than a quality family drama."
"It feels insightful but leaves a nagging feeling of surface-level psychology. Perhaps this is a harsh reading, but what we're left with is nonetheless a phantom -- a spectral silhouette where a person should be."
"I am tired of the same story lines in animated films. Be unique, not part of the herd. Be yourself and your Daddy will eventually be proud of you. Monkeys and penguins can fix planes with spit...Ok, that one is new."
"The movie prefers to tell rather than show, making for an incomplete fusion of social commentary and gothic scares."
"[Lemon's] execrable film debut ... suffers from reverse Norma Desmond syndrome: He's still small, it's the picture that got big."
Lin throws more vehicles into the mix - including a tank and a flaming cargo plane - but tosses plausibility and coherent editing out the window.
"""Rebel"" and ""pioneer"" are free-floating signifiers that are used to praise without really explaining why they are, or should be, praiseworthy."
"... a place-holder installment ... Let this be a lesson to JJ Abrams and Paramount: wait until you have new terrain to plow, something to say, before you summon Kirk and gang from dry dock."
The only frightening thing about this horror fantasy film was in how bad it was.
"There are welcome insights in to a culture largely ignored by society; unfortunately, they are married in to a domestic drama that slowly loses steam and never manages to overcome how boringly familiar its central scenario is."
"There is a good movie to be made about the difficulties parents have in letting go of their children. Actually, Ron Howard already made that movie. It was called Parenthood and it starred Steve Martin."
"Ah, the charm, inquisitiveness and imagination of pre-pubescent adolescence, as seen by a Hollywood screenwriter."
"It's a shame that this supremely talented duo is participating in such lowest-common-denominator, puerile material."
"Sarah Michelle Gellar may have ditched the Grudge franchise, but her predilection for illogical horror continues with The Return."
In a way Brooklyn's Finest falls prey to the paradox it sets up in its first and most riveting scene.
"It's not even remotely scary, which leaves the horror fans out. But it's also way too boring to even poke fun at."
"Scott Derrickson's remake ...provides the best evidence I've seen lately that money can't buy class. It also can't guarantee an effective movie, let alone a meaningful one."
Unfinished Business is a perfect storm of unfocused - mostly unfunny - mundane comedic filmmaking.
A complete mess that carries on as a cinematic band-aid offered to moviegoers probably wondering why they're expected to cry when they had nothing to do with the creation of this picture.
Be wary of any film that bookends a blistering portrait of social unrest with Skinemax-style sex scenes.
"More notable for what it isn't than what it is, it's one of the gangly middle children of the Disney animation family, not quite sure how to fit in, or even if it's valued."
"The result is pacy, patchy and, at the last, plain old slapdash: if anyone can work out what the eventual villain did -- or why -- please let us know."
"It's a decidedly mediocre effort, with exactly one memorable action scene, and when it pushes too hard into sentimental territory, it feels completely unearned."
"It is a loud and bloated live action mixed with animation that will appeal to the less discriminating young ones. I guess in that case it does exactly what it was supposed to, but it is impossible to even mildly recommend something like this."
[A] stylistically thrilling but ultimately tedious French import.
"For the wider audience, it's not pride or liberation we feel but deep artistic constraint."
"Among other notable missteps, the animated feature Everyone's Hero tries to convince us that arrogant perennial winners the New York Yankees are good guys, while lovable losers the Chicago Cubs are bad guys. Say what?"
A rom-com Trojan-horsed in a concept comedy.
Plays as if it might have come from Yorgos Lanthimos' bin of discarded ideas.
Garbage. Stinky garbage.
"Each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature, but in its current incarnation, Storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception."
A visual spectacle but also a mess of a movie with shallow characters&#44; messy storytelling and a lot of baffling filmic choices&#46;
"The premise is weak, the characters are dull, and it lacks the memorable punch that we saw on offer in Borat and The Dictator."
This feels more like your average TBS movie of the week and much less like a major motion picture.
"No one onscreen has the answers to the lofty questions Besson poses and, despite all the dizzying and splendid imagery of the film's closing frames, it's patently clear that neither does he."
"The scenery is still there, but just about everything else that worked in the first film doesn't in 'New Moon.' For one thing, the structure is a mess."
"The blood and gore become so extreme that they provoke titters of ridicule, undermining a simple, stirring story of family devotion as a man races from vile captors to return home and rescue his pregnant wife and their son."
"Overall ""Take Me Home Tonight"" represents a lateral move at best for its 24-hour party people, a step back at worst, and not worth your time either way."
The disappointment of The Lion King bodes poorly for live-action remakes of The Aristocats and Rescuers Down Under. Maybe Andy Serkis can do The Lion King with actors actually performing motion capture for the animals and that'll be better.
"A raunchy comedy that plays like a Superbad without the smarts, the heart, the originality or the laughs."
"In Etan Cohen's film, there is nothing new, nor any context, any opportunity for originality or grace. [Full Review in Spanish]"
The obvious response to a movie this bad is to press 'Delete' and hope you don't get an error message.
"There's no plot worth describing, no repartee wittier than 'Oh shut up,' no acting moments that rise above the level of posing."
Oliver Stone has a terrible sense of timing. This is a film that has been overtaken by events and already seems out of date.
"With its meticulous attention to detail and superior production values, the film promises much more than its unseasoned cast and thin plotting deliver."
"Its thrills fall with metronome-like precision, exactly when they are expected, and the clues complete the puzzle without surprise or personality."
The special effects are mediocre and the story is strewn with the type of plot inconsistencies and lazy dialogue all-too-typical of today's post-content blockbusters.
Further impediments to this film's credibility are the facts that all the actors appear too old to be playing college students and the characters live on a campus that is eerily deserted.
"Virtually every emotion, motivation, idea, character and plot point in the movie is flat and perfunctory -- except for those that carry the invisible subtitle, 'Cry, dammit!'"
The best part about the third Mummy movie is the Ninja Football Yetis that Brendan Frasier and pals encounter in the mountains of Tibet.
You needn't disagree with the film's cause to feel oppressed by its propagandistic approach - not to mention Philip Glass's relentlessly mournful score.
"By suppressing Wahlberg's more typical sparkling unpredictability, this new reading of the character recasts him into someone more frustrating than free."
"Besides being an offensive disservice to the sadly not singular tragedy of Alan Turing, how is The Imitation Game? Well, it has good performances."
"Clooney has not only created a unwieldy dichotomy between comedy and drama, he further complicates things by making the former unfunny and the latter unmoving."
Too high-minded to ever stoop to suspense or fun ...
"I don't know who grimaced in pain more during the film, Arnold Schwarzenegger or me."
RENT is mediocre and recommended only to those who can claim a familiarity with the play.
"I'm not sure we ever needed a Death Wish reboot, but we sure as hell don't need one now."
"It's like a ferret on crystal meth that belatedly discovers ecstasy, and it's a tiresome trip either way."
"It didn't get under my skin, just on my nerves."
"Young reprises his Broadway role and is adequate, but like the rest of the film it's a performance that never quite provides an emotional investment for the audience."
Ultimately&#44; it is guesswork by outsiders to determine Welles&#8217;s true intention for execution&#44; and knowing that always prevents a barrier from becoming truly engaged with the storytelling&#46;
"As Bill and Ted might say, it's one bogus journey, dude."
"One would assume (Holofcener) knows a thing or two about female friendships, but you wouldn't know it from this drivel."
Rodriguez is underserved in a film that wants to be a superhero movie but ends up an insulting and incompetent B-movie.
"The relentless and pointless sadism of the film left me cold and bored, which not even the presence of Rutger Hauer could cure."
This superficial romantic comedy wastes Keaton's blossoming performance (which Nicholson often steps on anyway).
This amiably dumb feature debut for New Zealand writer-director Jason Lei Howden could have used some additional polish on the scripting side to bump its bad-taste humor up from the routinely to the inspirationally silly.
"While the subject is very timely and worthy, this lame tale just falls completely flat."
"Admittedly, it is a children's movie with beautiful visual detail, but it seems that Favreau went overboard, because it adopts naturalistic charm over narrative substance. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Bomer is fine, for the record, though the character is a little overly refined and well-put-together to feel completely plausible."
"On a scale of one to Zemeckis, Hooper's Cats boldly goes beyond the uncanny valley and creates a tier of its own."
"To appreciate Girls Will Be Girls to the max, it probably helps to have taken at least one semester of Screen Camp 101."
"What distinguishes Flawless from other movies of the kind, unfortunately, is its absence of humor."
"In the end, Fifty Shades of Grey isn't so much terrible as it is timid and tame."
You'll never know how good the first three Diary of a Wimpy Kid movies were until you're forced to see the fourth one.
"The strong performances and crisp cinematography can't ease the relentless grimness of Lean on Pete, making it a film I just couldn't connect with no matter how hard I tried."
"Look at how Williams goes from unconsciously being Marilyn to consciously ""acting"" her. Would that the entire movie were as eloquent."
More concerned about coming up with graphic death scenes than anything else.
"If you're gonna bother with this alphabetic orgy of gore and carnage, do it On Demand so you can fast forward through the unbearably bad ones."
"Nearly everything misfires here - bizarrely so, since we can see where the laughs should come, how they would work, and how a more competent movie would get from A to Z."
This contrived feel-good film is a bit like adding artificial sweetener to eggnog.
"The movie is an utter mess, but it's the kind of maddening disappointment that could only be made by a director of Gilliam's stature."
Tackles the topic of life-ending despair with all the delicacy and grace of a Hallmark greeting card.
"An extremely silly treatment of a very serious subject, and an irritating puzzle to boot...an elaborate charade, the explanation for which will probably infuriate most viewers."
"Earwig and the Witch never finds the right tone, never really develops its characters, and never reaches the high standard of a Studio Ghibli production. It's profoundly skippable."
It's kind of like an Apple Watch - a new invention that's flashy but isn't practical or as impressive as it should be.
Wilson and Aniston's dramatic chops would have been better served by a film that did not need to interrupt their characters' story arcs every now and again for a broad bit about the rambunctious family canine.
"The combination of button-pushing uplift, sundry sweeping helicopter shots and a bombastic score that sounds like it came on a free transfer from a Tony Scott movie proves as resistibly synthetic as the CGI-enhanced heroics on the pitch."
"A mediocre, humorless, old-fashioned creature feature...hobbled by risible effects and a crude attempt at political relevance."
Offers a heroism high on condition that you can ditch disbelief ASAP.
Let's just say there's a huge twist coming that dazzles for about a minute and then leaves you feeling distinctly cross.
"There's simply nothing good about it. The special effects are ropey, the plot creaks, the performances are indifferent and - worst of all - it patronises the viewer with dialogue that explains what's about to happen at every turn."
"[The] plot is warmed-over Capra, and it's no wonderful-life yarn."
"With an enviable, well-stocked cast of character thespians and a carefully dilapidated motel set, Eaten Alive is all ingredients, no recipe."
A penniless heist film and a brainless zombie flick.
"Dave Scott's choreography is often dynamic and imaginative, but only a true fan is going to crave this much stepping."
"McQueen sets a relentlessly portentous tone and employs lots of stark mise-en-scene, but all the fuss feels arbitrary here - the pulpy story simply doesn't warrant such grave stylization."
Russell Crowe's the whole show in a thriller about a professor who needs to breaks his wife out of jail.
"One of Stone's unqualified failures, by which I mean that even his usually muscular style can't partially redeem."
"In the end, Darfur Now is a movie whose hopeful message is undermined by its seemingly hopeless reality."
Payne's obvious pathology isn't probed as deeply as it should be.
"Patriki doesn't call down the thunder with his screen mayhem, keeping the effort lively with gunplay but finding little else to separate it from the competition."
"An ambitious, audacious failure..."
"It worked before, yet it fails miserably here, sure to leave fans of the original picture and Houston devotees with a pounding headache."
"Lakeboat requires its audiences to embrace it as lovingly as Mamet and Mantegna embrace its men, but it's a lot to ask."
"[Natalie] Portman has a great track record of playing women under extreme psychological pressure and this turn is equally Oscar-worthy. Unfortunately, the film supporting her, over-directed by TV's Noah Hawley, isn't of the same calibre."
"I also admired the darkly atmospheric look of the film, and the way it sustains its creepy mood. But I cringed when the death of the general's daughter was played out. Did the details have to be so graphic?"
"A vile, nasty piece of work, this paranoid thriller gives vent to the frustration so much of us are feeling in an exploitive manner that is borderline offensive."
"Theron prides herself in having made herself a fixture of the action genre, however, she's become a parody of herself, her tough-gal posture a bit too obvious, her pithy quips a bit too tired and her action sequences a bit too choreographed."
It's yet another movie where you frequently have no idea what's going on or why.
"Ninjago reeks of the dreaded marketing ploy, wherein a subset of LEGO's omnivorous, pop-cultural universe is shunted out into the public arena minus so much of the topical wit and actual emotion of the prior two films."
"Brando reflects on his contribution to the art of the movies; his view seems to shift over the years from pride to cynicism, but Riley doesn't identify the recordings by date. Rather, he melds them into a banal concoction that's unworthy of their source."
"Back before Netflix, there was a name for movies like this: They were called direct-to-video, bypassing the paying public at the multiplexes, and with good reason."
"As a post-financial-crisis movie, Paranoia is muddled at best, wagging its finger at Hemsworth's ambitious bridge-and-tunnel type while fetishizing the life of luxury he cheats his way into."
"Swordfish drowns in cliche, implausibility and cryptic little mysteries and misdirections that viewers are supposed to accept as intricate and edgy storytelling."
"Seldom has the potential destruction of the world seemed as dull as it does in ""Wrath of the Titans."""
You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
"The Resident clocks in at a lean 91 minutes, yet I'd rather have had a longer film if it meant the bizarre gaps in the plot were plugged."
The film's purposely fragmented assembly never allows for Dunst's character to evolve into something tangible
"The political allegories are mostly abandoned and swapped for character motivation, as if we should never have bothered to contemplate a second meaning in the first place."
As pretty and bland as its lead actors.
A mildly engaging spy thriller with a dull plot and not enough laughs&#44; suspense&#44; thrills or zaniness&#46;
"Despite some nice touches, this is the sort of too-precious indie film that gives its characters unnecessary quirks (like diabetes) to make them more 'real'."
"There just wasn't enough. Not enough laughs, not enough characters to care about, not enough sense. And perhaps most unforgivable of all: Not enough Godzilla versus Kong."
"You find yourself wondering what it was in Truffaut that ever appealed to you. It seemed to be something genuine, and now it seems lost."
This mean-spirited and surprisingly unfunny Stiller/Farrelly teaming is truly heartbreaking.
Could this all be a deeper reflection on the male refusal to grow up and his long-told fear of commitment? Not in this one-dimensional fluff piece.
There is barely enough of a story to hold the interest of adult moviegoers.
A swell twist and fine performances in an otherwise average thriller.
"A film of brilliant moments, but sadly less coherent - and, on senses, rather less personal - than most of Gilliam's work."
A pointless and tiresome exercise.
The Predator does everything it can to effectively kill off further interest in the franchise.
Terribly long-winded and uninspiring.
There are laughs to be had within Talladega Nights but they're certainly not worth the money a trip to the cinema will surely cost.
"Teenage resilience is on fine display, but Homeroom does feel like a strong film hampered by the unfortunate realities of what happened to the world in 2020."
Nocebo doesn&#8217;t pack the punch it intends to&#44; the point-of-view sleight of hand limiting the impact&#46; It&#8217;s not the body horror promised by the catalyst&#44; either&#46; Instead&#44; it&#8217;s a muddled if well-performed tale that leans heavily on an idea that needs to die&#46;
The fact that Russo-Young makes it all watchable is a miracle in itself
"Turbo is pleasantly mediocre, easy to watch and dismissible by the time you hit the parking lot."
As lame as 'Plan 9' and 'Glen or Glenda' but not quite as unintentionally funny.
Its go-nowhere storylines and visual indifference will probably play better at home when you're stoned and looking at your phone.
Repugnant
"It is so disturbing it makes you uncomfortable watching it. For the price of admission, you become an unwilling voyeur."
"A dose of stodgy comfort food in the form of a complacent, mediocre film, with an exasperatingly flaccid and anti-climactic ending."
"Judd Apatow continues his quest to kill comedy with coarse, low class, low-intellect rubbish like this, which can turn you mind to porridge if you sit through it."
"Damned if those dual spoilsports, the gladiatorial director Ridley Scott reteamed with his portly star Russell Crowe, haven't drained every drop of merriment right out of the myth."
"Unless you like the feeling of being hit on the head repeatedly with a hammer, avoid this one."
"Simplistic, silly and tedious."
"While the film has loads of style, it doesn't have enough substance to work as a horror film (which it sometimes impersonates) or as an absorbing drama."
Handsomely filmed but wan period romance.
"The interpolations of ""heavenly"" sequences of Jeremy Lin playing basketball against CGI backdrops offer a hokey visual analogue for the intersection of faith and sports in his life."
"Though it hints at moments of wit, Cuck never feels serious enough to be a convincing character study and not garish enough to head into genre territory. Ultimately, this sordid tale feels both real and inconsequential."
"It's intended to expand a popular fiction franchise into film, but the workmanlike direction of Christopher McQuarrie, although sporadically entertaining, may doom this flick to one-off status."
All style and very little substance in this oft-told tale of inner-city angst.
A predictable mano-a-mano macho competition that bogs and meanders.
"The final act of The House with a Clock in Its Walls stumbles between awkward, telegraphed jolts and busy, effects-heavy action, completely losing sight of the trauma and grief that was meant to give the film its emotional core."
A starry cast share out roles that are less like characters than places in a lifeboat.
"While a beautiful and moving film, The White Countess, sadly falls short of being a great one because it never allows us into the hearts of its primary protagonists."
The Return is routine in its depiction of a waifish young woman surrounded by men with predatory qualities. It's sad to see Buffy so disempowered.
"The bigger The Protector 2 gets, the further it gets away from Jaa's basic appeals [...] Clearing a room flush with faceless bad guys is what Jaa does, but otherwise, less is more."
"When the overripe dialogue and stodgy pace prove tiresome, there is always a great deal of artistic detail upon which the eyes can feast."
"I couldn't shake the feeling that it might have been conceived and filmed as a comedy, then edited so that it plays like a thriller."
"There's plenty of manly weeping onscreen when the decepticons start executing captured autobots, but as far as I could tell, there wasn't a damp eye in the theatre."
"Whilst still entertaining enough to satisfy, Lego Ninjago is definitely the weakest entry in the franchise."
Ford gives it the old college try and it's decently paced but it's not enough to elevate it from the muck and mire of a boring script made by an unimaginative director.
"[CANNES 2016] Jeff Nichols's ""Loving"" is an anodyne telling of the interracial Virginia couple (Richard and Mildred Loving) whose 1967 Supreme Court case forever altered regional laws allowing such couple's rights to marry."
"While the movie will probably rake in big bucks from her built-in fan base (and their moms), the decision to showcase her dramatic chops may not have been in Cyrus' best long-term interest."
No more bland white ladies at the front and center of black stories.
"Full of good intentions, We Are Marshall has a game plan that's hard to fault, but as with any playbook, a scheme is only as good as how well it's executed."
"A logic-free, utterly joyless thriller that substitutes a wild goose chase for an actual plot"
A sexily chaotic parody of entitlement becomes just another tale of a white dude learning that there are worse things in life than essentially having no problems.
A fanciful project that's tantalizing on paper but largely DOA on screen.
Sucker Punch offers a perfect portrait of storytelling gone wrong. Even the movie's attempt to comment on the problems of storytelling goes wrong.
"Stanley Kubrick's efforts to mix fantasy and reality are resolved too often in overused scenes of the persecuted kid, threatened woman, loud effects, and a deluge of blood. The result is an excessively calculated and distant film. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Disappointing indie comedy. One joke that's not even that funny the first time.
"An ill-defined mishmash of cliches, with poorly sketched characters and leaden dialogue."
The problem lies with Shyamalan's plodding pacing.
"Cross the Gidget flicks with a sudsy fish-out-of-water tale and -- poof -- you'll get this 'tween fantasy, which only lands with a small splash."
Visually stunning and mentally numbing. Not only will you not be able to understand it...you won't care.
This knee-jerk pathos is a reflex from both America's Reagan-era hip-hop and England's Thatcher-era miserabilist pop. Call it Automatic Pity.
One wonders if Capitalism won't look almost avant garde when seen decades removed from the Moore cult of personality.
The Addams Family 2 is the scary reminder that this franchise should have be deceased years ago. All puns intended.
"This sorta over-ripe Freudianism is, like, so-o-o-o yesterday."
Some intriguing ideas about loyalty and redemption are offset by the formulaic trappings of this crime thriller that squanders a strong cast.
"Rather than focusing on the meat of the film, re: the ginormous robots that are awesome, the film spends an absurdly long time setting up its character development for the humans."
"For my taste, everything about The Stone Angel is too nailed-down and on-the-nose."
The home fries are too salty for my taste.
A dud that tries to hide a simplistic plot and muddled message with frenzied flag-waving and overheated performances.
"We've been down this path before with Ferrell, and at this point it feels like we're just walking in circles."
Ted 2 is 1 too many
It becomes increasingly contrived and drawn out.
"It's so bad that it's good, remember? It's bad, but it's funny! You're laughing! Right? The truth, unfortunately, is that the novelty of Statham's self-mocking performance and deadpan antics fades away... It is so bad that it's bad."
Just because it meets the minimal standards for what constitutes a feature-length running time does not mean it satisfies the basic ones for what passes as entertainment.
A high cuteness quotient does not a movie make.
"Hugh Jackman is the only reason to see this picture, which is essentially a retro, old-fashioned father-son melodrama."
"A slick piece of pro-life propaganda, it has relatively luxe production values, painfully earnest performances, and a drippy ""inspirational"" score."
"Unfortunately, the film never quite crosses that line into campy territory, merely teasing what a less serious treatment of Lizzie's story might look like."
Dull and unmoving.
"Scott is great, as usual, at flashy pyrotechnics, but action fans will probably lose patience with all the tangled plotting."
"A mind-numbing, soul-deadeningly dull experience, it is a miracle of mediocrity, a small wonder: how can anything be quite this tedious?"
"John Gulager is neither artist nor genius, bringing only straight-to-video conviction to Piranha 3DD."
This is the kind of movie that will make you want to go back in time -- to the moment before you made the rash decision to start watching it.
"From relatively safe foundations, Summerland completely loses sight of its appeal amid the weeds of overwrought plotting, squandering the undeniable talent of both Arterton and Mbatha-Raw."
"Very occasionally charming, but also barrel-scraping."
"... the farfetched beginning is such a turn-off that as the story becomes more credible, we don't have much patience to forgive the absurdities that dominate the first half."
Totally predictable. [Full review in Spanish]
An unremarkable thriller elevated by a few excellent performances and Paolo Virz's direction.
The inconsistency in tone leaves Without a Paddle up a certain unnamed creek.
"For a small coming-of-age film, this picture is remarkably well photographed and acted. But the single-mindedness with which it seems determined to have almost everyone rowing in the same sexual direction finally becomes a bit oppressive."
2012 rarely convincingly places its stars in the midst of destruction.
It's hard to warm up to a movie when you hate its central character and it's also frustrating when a comedy about stand-up goes out of its way to be so unfunny.
The movie's two-star rating belongs almost exclusively to a four-star performance from Elizabeth Banks.
"Completely devoid of cinematic wit, sensuality or even simple technique."
"A showcase for three eminent actresses that includes Jacqueline Bisset and Renee Zellweger as well. And the delicately layered ways in which women bond and unbond, however awkward or misread, when men aren't around."
"Apart from some priceless moments early on, Three Men and a Baby is just Three Men and a Cradle all over again, as utterly predictable and utterly unremarkable as ever. "
"Taken as a whole, Why We Fight is the work of someone who started with a conclusion and made sure he got there."
"[Creates] the worst kind of mythologizing, the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama."
"I love the tone of the film and its construction, but it ultimately goes to places I'm not willing to follow."
"Christophe Gans' convoluted, overlong adaptation of the video game Silent Hill is the worst kind of horror movie: trash that takes itself seriously."
"Autumn in New York is saddled with a sappy, silly script."
Devotees of awful filmmaking can't go wrong with this one.
Hyde Park on Hudson is a disappointingly bland mix of drama and comedy that never comes close to gelling.
It will come as a surprise to none that Grudge Match is so wantonly clichd that to watch it is to explore the outer perimeters of one's own tolerance for a specific type of feel-good sports film.
It's the clunky screenplay and Jonathan Rhys Meyers's performance as an undercover German-Israeli agent that do the damage.
"The Bye Bye Man is one of the most amateurish wide-release movies I've ever seen. Why anyone thought this thing was in good enough shape to warrant an opening in more than 2,000 theaters is a mystery."
An interminable oral sex and flatulence joke masquerading as a movie.
"Ultimately, Jane learns her place as a girl, softens up and loses some of the intensity that made her an interesting character to begin with."
"It's a difficult tonal balance to achieve, and Blakeson can't quite cut it, despite a committed performance from Pike and some sharp, witty dialogue."
"It's a dollop of gory goofiness, a side dish minus the main course."
"""Beginning! Middle! End! Condense! Details! Plot!,"" yells John Turturro's G-man at a robot somewhere in the middle of the morass ""Revenge of the Fallen"" becomes. Forget ""More than meets the eye."" Michael Bay should have more so heeded that cry."
"Queen enthusiasts will probably choke on some of the egregious sins against chronology and raw facts committed to cram the real story into the format. However, where the script succeeds is in the most complicated part of Mercury: his approach to love."
"Remember the disappointment you felt that Christmas when Santa brought you an off-brand Cabbage Patch Kids counterfeit when you asked for the real thing? Well, if you grew up on the ""Child's Play"" movies, then brace yourself for more of the same..."
"Well-acted and worthy, but ultimately rather dull movie, let down by a half-hearted script and a sudden climactic dive into sentimentality."
Halloween should be about one thing&#58; Michael Myers has a knife and he&apos;s trying to kill us&#46; Why overthink it&#63;
"Stratton doesn't work for many reasons, and while Cooper is a talented actor, he struggles here to pull off the action hero protagonist."
The foundation of a much better movie is buried somewhere beneath the debris that's too quickly piled on to The Kings of Summer ...
"You go into a movie like The Tourist hoping for a feast of personality from the stars. What you get, in this case, is a waxworks version of chemistry."
"As talented as the cast is, not a one makes this an Alamo worth remembering"
The story thus runs always full of interest but something is lacking in strength ...
"As an info dump, Table is admirably efficient, addressing everything from obesity to the limits of charity. As a film, it's less compelling ..."
"Sums up everything that's wrong with American remakes of foreign films: it's dumbed down so far, it's just plain dumb."
Drag a guy to this one and he'll never forgive you.
"There is a perfectly reasonable way to escape this time-waster, and that's just not to watch it."
"Save Close and Depardieu, 102 Dalmatians is entirely lackadaisical Disney fare."
Jigsaw doesn't quite get there as far as slasher films go. It's a weak imitation of the previous films but it's not the weakest in the franchise.
"It gets so frustrating that you wish you had a big, gooey wad of rotting Camembert to throw at the screen."
"Compared to a documentary like Darwin's Nightmare, which found disturbing visual analogues for the moral rot of global trade, Black Gold makes most of its points in words, not pictures."
"A documentary that asks many comics big questions about the dispositions of comics - but doesn't often enough put anyone off balance, the audience included."
"A textbook example of how not to mess with success, Cheaper by the Dozen 2 is every bit as forced, synthetic, banal and mawkish as the first edition."
Poor Sigourney Weaver! Why does she succumb to the temptation of making these movies?
&#46;&#46;&#46;sporadically watchable yet mostly &#40;and curiously&#41; inert&#46;&#46;&#46;
"A grueling, embarrassing vanity vehicle..."
This is half a good film but hardly a wholly satisfactory one.
"Cattet and Forzani are more interested in the imagery and textures of giallo than they are in telling a rich, comprehensible story."
"Even in high school, thinking of plots as puzzles is a pretty facile way to think about films, and as such the pleasures of I Origins remain strictly superficial."
"Shults has proven himself to be a brilliant filmmaker already... But Waves gets away from him, the film far more captivated by sound and spectacle than it is character and story."
It&#8217;s not fresh enough to be called original and not smart enough to be called a parody&#46;
"loved the attention to English period rural detail but the pace is sluggish, the story distinctly unmagical..."
Karyn Kusama's quietly chilling direction enlivens a somewhat plodding housebound thriller.
"Our counselors' lawyer-ese is illegally bland, and their committee-penned banter meticulously Botoxed."
[A] lazily ingratiating spy spoof.
"If there is any thought more singularly horrifying than that of a mask franchise, may it never enter this critic's humble noggin."
"Unfortunately, the screenplay quickly descends into utter illogic, and ... Whitaker fails to sustain the fairy-tale atmosphere he's so clearly striving for."
"For all of its delving into native mythology, there's not much story to speak of."
"Thrilling in the air as it is, it's a cliched old war movie on the ground, with a groaner I-can't-speak-your-language romance and every stereotype short of a kid named 'Brooklyn'."
"McConaughey made more of an impression as a stock-trading bro in his single scene in The Wolf of Wall Street. Here, there's not even anything compelling about his fall."
"It's thin, but enough to make you forget the cold for 90 minutes."
"It's hard to say that the picture is bad, just that it's dry as tinder without a spark to ignite it."
"For all its of-the-moment charms, ""Escape Room"" can't shake its more basic genre trappings, eventually giving itself over to tired and predictable revelations and flimsy twists."
A Dark Castle de Silver e Zemeckis parece ser simplesmente incapaz de realizar um filme que não seja horrível; e este 'terror' estúpido é mais uma prova disso.
"Transformers: The Last Knight may have been the most enjoyable Transformers film in years, but that's a low, low bar, and it certainly doesn't put it on a level to be called anything but bad."
"We're left with a film that seems at odds with itself. The Boys in the Band gets the job done, but it doesn't always get it right."
"This movie is lively at times, it's lovely to look at, and the actors are persuasive in very difficult material. But around and around it goes, and where it stops, nobody by that point much cares."
"[Director Silberling] attempted to make a movie of pure sentiment, but whenever he seems to strike a genuine chord -- and he's clearly capable of touching the viewer -- he pushes it too far and it turns sappy."
"Grows increasingly ludicrous over the course of its nearly two-hour running time, to the point where it almost appears to become a comedy."
...plagued by unreasonably amateurish performances and lackluster scripting.
"It's a standard plot and, despite the combined talents of cast and director, this is no more than a standard comedy."
Totally grody!
"Sweetly absurd, it's silly, slapstick fun."
"In the end, Steep plays like a TV infomercial -- and who wants to hand over $11 to watch one?"
This is the Bourne repetition.
"While not horrible, this is simply a lackluster and forced tale that happens to feature a few good performances."
the type of movie you hope no one ever brings up in polite company because you don't want to look like an a******.
"The plot is a pretext for nonstop, bone-crushing mayhem of a mind-numbing kind."
The screenwriters seem to have dedicated far more time to trying to shoehorn in as many gags involving things flying off the screen than into trying to come up with an interesting story in which to frame them.
"The movie settles for cursory, disconnected allusions that don't exactly build character (Cage does some more Elvis impersonating and Elliott looks plenty leathery)."
[Stallone] has to wade through way too many scenes in which show-offy camera work turns him upside down or flashes lights at him or divides him up into three screens.
"Given all the talent involved, this should have been much more compelling."
The first of three crummy sequels unworthy of the original.
"A middling movie, an admirable effort that looks much better than Star Wars: The Clone Wars but won't incite similar battles, pro or con."
Everyone on view is so fundamentally decent and goody-goody that no real tension or unresolvable conflicts ever surface.
You're better off sticking to the novel.
"Though it's being sold as a clever-clever meta-comedy in which Nicholas Cage spoofs himself, the film's novelty value quickly evaporates in deference to a fairly tame, occasionally lame crime-comedy with very little sense of style."
The affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to Demme's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled Hollywood post-production effects.
A handsomely made but dramatically inert and not very scary sequel to 2012's surprise-hit ($127 million worldwide) Edwardian chiller.
"Weird for weird sake, barely competent filmmaking and ultimately, a pointless enterprise."
"Reeves, as the killer, has the fairly thankless task of saying only what the movie needs him to say; he's limited by the fact that his killer has no real dimension or personality apart from his function as a plot device."
"Aside from Ferdinand the Bull and Lupe the Goat, none of the characters offer much in the way of interest. They're filling gaps in the story until it reaches its inevitable conclusion."
"The Men Who Stare At Goats is trying to be a smart, black, satirical comedy... Yet on the other hand, it's still trying to be a mainstream Hollywood movie. And whenever the two impulses come into conflict, Hollywood wins."
"Uneven in tone and full of action, ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is an above-average fever dream of a movie that's a grownup nod to a grim fairy tale."
"The real problem, when all is said and done, is that this is a film set in a land where genuine magic has been pretty much relegated to the past in the name of instant gratification and it feels more like a product of that world than a critique of it."
"The problem is it spends so much time dragging these things out that by the time you get to the resolution, you kinda just don't care one way or the other."
"Ford v Ferrari feels like a throwback to the bloated prestige pictures of the '80s, all the way down to its USA-first message."
"It feels like what it really needed was a bit more patience, attention and TLC, but there are two Hellboy films like that already."
"Either the movie is stupid, or it believes the audience is stupid. Neither is a good look."
"It rambles on for more than two hours, thumbing through genre touchstones like a drunk in a video store, serving up the occasional visual that sticks."
"All in all, the film just tries to do too much."
"The film presents its main characters in an overall simplified manner, where a character's personal dilemmas and inner conflicts are represented by plot much more so than by character."
"In all, it's a peculiar mishmash, simultaneously bland and suggestive."
"After the setup, the movie's scenarios alternate between routine and ridiculous."
Disappointing action movie which doesn't ever fully exploit the possibilities of its premise.
"Franchise diehards will get their required fix of swashbuckling nonsense, but if you left the series after World's End, this isn't worth returning for."
"It brought something unique and raw to the table, but unfortunately, it felt simplified, leaving not a lot of room for interpretation or discussion."
"n the end, however, Production Office feels too slender to be called a feature film -- it's like a terrific 15-minute comedy routine that somehow got stretched to the 90-minute mark."
A do-the-right-thing film that lacks technical savvy but makes up for it with well-earned manipulation&#46;
Even a likable and authoritative performance from Tom Hanks can't keep this movie in the air.
It&apos;s familiar and formulaic yet Stallone does get a laugh when he mutters&#44; &quot;I&apos;m not going to wreck my knees entertaining you&#46;&quot;
"Even though Hall is endearingly enthusiastic, it's hard to care if her character wins through."
"Crammed into a mere 90 minutes, it's just a cavalcade of rock star impressions, performed on the same little stage during a series of auditions and performances."
"This is not by any means a good movie, but there are a few key moments that crackle, suggesting that first time filmmaker Matt Sobel may come back with something more worthwhile some day."
"It feels about 2012 minutes too long, a bloated epic that outstays its welcome long before the credits have rolled."
"It's competently acted and its mission is understood, but Fjellman doesn't provide a strong enough reason to make the journey with him, as much of ""Caged"" seems constructed to satisfy the helmer, not viewers."
The sort of thing for which the term Eurotrash was invented. A cerebral variant of 'feardotcom'...it might better be called 'merdedotcom.'
"Apprently, even gross-out comedy requires some delicacy."
It just makes me sad to think director Scott Stewart and all the artists under him had high ambitions and substantial resources... for this.
The things it's parodying -- Beatles and Bond movies and all those secret-agent TV shows of the 60s -- were already so tongue in cheek that one needs to go a lot further than this movie goes to really amuse me.
"Take a group of talented actors, add an unbelievable script and a sophomore director and what do you get?"
"The bad guys are bad, the good guys are bad, and the background characters are worse; even the dancers in a strip club are devoid of the usual glamor."
"Struggles to balance its toddler-focused origins with the demands of blockbuster filmmaking, mostly landing in an awkward middle ground."
This is the first Jarmusch film that feels behind the curve instead of ahead of it.
"Fanning resembles an acting robot: stick a quarter in her head and she'll dial up any reaction in the book, absent the needed gravitas."
"While visually vibrant and generally well-acted, Farinelli is strangely not very compelling."
"Overall, the film misses the brilliance of Jelinek's novel by some way. It settles for being merely grim."
"A structurally efficient Christmas film that's rarely genuinely joyful. Though Duvall presents each scene as a gift wrapped in beautiful, hopeful packages, inside each one is yet another pair of socks."
"A Simple Favor could have worked quite well in the hands of a more capable filmmaker. Feig, however, is too workmanlike . . . to boil this mystery from the inside out."
The multiverse concept is discombobulating enough as it is&#44; so when so many things are hurled together at maddening speed&#44; it can be pretty exhausting&#46; Despite some good performances&#44; this MCU movie isn&#8217;t one I&#8217;m keen on revisiting anytime soon&#46;
"You can get more dramatic complexity, excitement, jaw-dropping plot twists, inter-agent romance, and cool gadgetry for free by looking to TV's Alias and 24 for your next espionage assignment."
"A transformative actor could use our expectations to his advantage, but Gere never comes off as more than an actor researching a role on homelessness."
"Nobody's trying all that hard with ""Half Brothers,"" with digestibility the goal here, not hilarity."
Kudos to Higher Ground for respectfully presenting a drama that just happens to be about Christianity. If only that weren't the best thing it had going for it.
"Lamb is artistic and evokes a variety of emotions but while a half sheep, half human baby seems cute, it is also a little disturbing."
"This feature debut deals mainly in clichs, never transforming the tough question at its center into compelling cinema."
"The moment the plot takes hold, this most likable film unmercifully dies."
"Fairly putrid in both conception and execution. Still, you can't stop looking at it."
Viggo's performance is the only payoff for the patience you will need to get through Everybody Has a Plan.
Couldn't it have pushed more on the doors of debate? Questioned more the motives - lightly interrogated - of the singer's political activism?
"Siegel's expertise with crime melodrama brings a fine, gripping, suspenseful quality to the story, which is, alas, too defective to stand up to any scrutiny."
"Less a brave movie than a foolhardy one. Trapped in a no man's land between seriousness and pulp trash, it plays like a combination of Death Wish and The Hours. If that sounds like an awkward fit, it is."
"Instead of humorous, this film is obtuse. Instead of romantic, it's boorish. Do yourself a favor and just pass on this bloated piece of gunk and rent some of the earlier films from director Woody Allen, which ""Country"" so woefully tries to emulate."
"Takes one of the great stories of all time...and reduces it to an ugly, unwatchable mess that is completely devoid of what has fascinated people for centuries"
"With Kerouac declaring that ""the only thing that matters is the conceptions in my own mind,"" we're still left waiting for the filmmaker who can take us there."
Granted&#44; having Dern&#44; Neil and Goldblum in the mix again is somewhat of a coup for this ailing franchise&#44; but nothing&#44; not even Goldblum&#8217;s infamous scenery-chewing style of acting could save this from being the worst film in the series&#46;
"This film really struggles to justify its existence. And I'm just not convinced, ""it's not as bad as it could have been"" is a good enough reason to make a movie in hindsight."
"How It Ends feels less like a film that it does a conveyor-belt of skit-style cameos stapled together. It's too inoffensive to be bad, but just completely forgettable."
"Too many moments in ""Genesis"" come off as too deterministically 'by design' to achieve the aching loneliness Lesage so obviously wants to convey."
"Stir Of Echoes is an okay psychological thriller, but it plays like a poor man's Sixth Sense."
There's not a lot for me to connect to with this movie.
I've seen the best anime movies of my generation destroyed by bad writing.
A dreary action-mystery that spends far too much time mucking around a villainous plot that isn't nearly as difficult to unravel as the protagonist makes it.
"Before the movie began, there was a promotional video where the stars promised to refund anyone that didn't laugh, and honestly, I should be chasing them down on that offer"
"The action and stunts are spectacular and entertaining, but big time Jet Li fans will be ultimately disappointed with the dull and predictable story."
There are only 20 minutes in the whole film where Flanagan gets even remotely close to the subtexts of the book and the original film. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Adapted from the Patricia Highsmith novel by Zach Helm and Sam Levinson, the film is a hot mess almost from minute one. The editors of the film understood what a dog of a story they had on their hands, as the film is cut to within an inch of its life. "
"It's a well-modulated, immensely likable picture that's finally too polite for both its subject matter and its critical theme."
"The movie, which has a stern warning against sugar-based cereals, is sugared cereal."
"A monumentally awful movie. Pretentious, uninformed, boring, and enough to drive one to a steady diet of Adam Sandler movies."
"Maybe Tolkien had a fascinating life story full of anecdotes that inspired his future work, but it isn't told here."
"Believers might be up for this collection of boilerplate emotions, but anyone hoping for the moral complexities of, oh, I dunno, reality will find little to chew on here."
"It's never clear what's happening, where the characters are running to, why corpses are hooked up to EKG machines and why ""imaginary"" characters are prone to the sufferings of the flesh."
"Wheatley's version isn't the disaster some prayed it would be, but it is a limp redo with gorgeous production values and gorgeous people."
"At a certain point, the pic's unpretentious B-movie style, like its generic and uninformative title, seems to indicate a simple lack of ambition."
"Fiennes has neither disgraced, nor distinguished himself, with this solemn soap. He wants to tell Nelly's story but the real woman - and the man she spent 13 years of her life with - slips through his fingers."
"The resolution of the emotional crises seems manufactured, and the final sequence on a tourist coach driven by an incompetent idiot also. These moments drag the film down, despite all its potential."
The documentary debut of Emmy Award-winning Bay Area TV journalist Jonathan Karsh pays a price for its hands-off approach.
"In this waterlogged indie film, a moody ingenue takes in drive-by glimpses of Everett, Washington, her new hometown."
"The visuals are all there -- if films got prizes for best poster, this one would be a shoo-in. But story, heart and purpose all seem to be lost at sea."
"While the emphasis on suggestion over standard biopic spectacle is novel, one suspects the film probably won't be suggestive, coherent or affecting enough for hardcore Hokusai admirers, leaving it to occupy a curious artistic no-man's-land."
An average film that never really quite works. [Full review in Spanish]
"An incomprehensible cacophony of screams, shock cuts, dour pseudo-philosophizing, heavy metal mutilation and low-rent TV-standard performances."
"Talk about your mindless entertainment! The acting in this thing is worse than deplorable. Had the acting been any better, the film wouldn't have worked. But it's clear that nobody is taking anything seriously and it is somehow strangely enjoyable."
Trying too hard is the death of cool in any genre -- especially a dead one -- and Smokin' Aces has all the sophisticated plotting of a splatter-happy video game.
It's visual eye candy in the nether world and not much more.
"[Reitman] has no salient visual style, no idiosyncratic point of view, no especial personal touch whatever: A roomful of studio marketing gurus might have dreamed him up just as they did that fake blurbmeister Sony invented."
"Fails its first test, which is that the audience believe every word of it."
"Bright never convinces you that it has thought through the rules of its alternate reality, with the result that you can't suspend disbelief, and it isn't a reality."
"Horrible Bosses 2 passes the time, but that's about it."
"It doesn't click, particularly for Johnson, whose proven flair for physical comedy doesn't extend to an amusing and/or accurate Danny DeVito impression."
"Vardalos is a much better actress than she is a writer, and the patchy script has a desperate, thrown-together feeling to it, as if she had to scramble to come up with something after Wedding's gargantuan success."
"A gore bore. ""Barf bags"" were handed out to people paying to see this in theaters. No-Doze would have been more appropriate."
"Del Amo chooses to focus on the humor, but it comes off as humor designed to placate mass audiences rather than staying true to the source material. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Refn has stated that the effect he was going for was an acid trip, and he's succeeded maybe a bit too well, as the initial surface trance wears off to reveal not much else going on."
A great performance does not make a biopic great...a biopic needs to be like Ray Charles - departing from formula and daring to be different.
Running With Scissors fails to make the cut.
It's the greatest love story no one ever wanted told.
"What's supposed to rattle us as a bout of simulated night terror, comes off more as an acute episode of extreme nearsightedness."
"In another time and place, Law Abiding Citizen could have been an intelligent critique of a flawed criminal justice system. Instead, I present you Gerard Butler, ruthlessly hacking a guy into 25 little pieces."
"Much like its redesigned, back-to-the-cartoon look, Sonic never really tries to be its own thing."
"Those who aren't already converts to Perry's dramaturgy will wonder what elevates this material above, say, a typical episode of '227.'"
A boring and repetitive sequel...
"It starts with great, giddy promise, and then bleeds out"
"The panic room itself is a provocative concept and it says something about modern society, but I'm not sure if it deserved its own movie."
"Besides the fact that this unfunny, treacly comedy treads some very familiar ground, it also makes a serious case that Madonna can't act."
"While Guess Who gets some mileage out of its black and white issues, it's more focused on being the interracial romantic comedy answer to Meet the Parents."
"As he did with his adaptation of ""Phantom of the Opera,"" Argento offers up a version that plays like a choppy condensation based on hazy memories of the book, then augments it with nudity and gore."
The Lifeguard sadly drowns in its own clichés.
"With a running time of nearly two hours, this regressive throwback is a nod to the prehistoric storytelling techniques Hollywood apparently still hasn't extricated itself from."
At nearly every turn the filmmaking weakens the story's sense of purpose rather than bringing to life intriguing themes concerning identity and self-preservation.
"Antebellum may have started with earnest motivations but betrayed itself by opting for shock and awe instead of significant, thought-provoking drama."
"If (this) sounds like entertainment to you, perhaps you should save the price of admission and put it toward therapy."
This movie wasn't firing on all cylinders despite some of them being great cylinders.
Predictably ridiculous.
"The intent is sincere, but the execution heavy handed and excessive."
"The action's here, there, and everywhere... but all this to-ing and fro-ing fails to advance the narrative with the compelling force you crave in movies."
An unappealing and operatic screen adaptation of the Brothers Grimm fable.
"It's hard to tell one growling, sabre-toothed orc apart from another."
"The filmmakers allow their characters to learn the usual humanist lessons, in the process eliding the ramifications of their scenario."
We'll never know what it would it have been like to have seen the De Niro of the Raging Bull era opposite Douglas in his Wall Street years but we'll always remember that sequence in Last Vegas when a guy in a thong shakes his junk in De Niro's face.
"If you need to read a review to decide if you want to see ""Alien Resurrection,"" you absolutely shouldn't be going."
Depressingly predictable in its ideas and tedious in its boneheaded brutality.
"while there is inherent diversity among these players, there is so much about them that is the same in terms of personality, desires, and ideologies that we start longing to get out of their world and into someone else's"
"While visually arresting, 9 is narratively a pretty familiar piece, and at once too mature for children and too childish for adults."
"This is an impressive film in many ways, and Nolan directs with real confidence, yet the overall result feels cumbersome."
Deadly family ties
Vikar is just a weird guy left out to dry on a plotline.
"What could have been a good black comedy ends up failing, with formulaic and didactic representations of immigrants as beings worth of holiness, stripped of complexity. [Full Review in Spanish]"
It largely consists of Franco musing about depictions of homosexual activity on film.
Destined to disappoint royal family followers and romantic comedy supporters.
"The interplay of the metaphoric and the literal, of artistic form and arbitrary symmetry, might still amuse Peter Greenaway, but for most of the rest of us the game is getting a little old."
"Takes its cues from the Mel Gibson School of Screen Martyrdom, making sure this education on Mexican history carries significant ugliness."
"No evolutionary leap forward in the world of computer-generated animation, just another palatable, familiar children's diversion in shiny new form."
"Sadistic and shallow, exploitative and misogynistic, these are the descriptions that 'Sucker Punch' seems not to be so much offended by as revel in."
"Just another self-absorbed teen chronicle, with the added twist of a little time travel and a surprise ending."
"The lights are on, but nobody's home."
These kids are going after perfectly innocent nice adults. They are some of the nastiest children in movie history.
"Overall, you get the impression of a ferociously intelligent director flirting with a veneer of dumbness for the fun of it, but the act never really convinces."
"Jolie gives Lara an upper class British accent, but it's so denatured that she sounds like one of those British techno-pop goddesses on a Valium drip."
"""THAT IS NOT, IN FACT, A TWIST! THAT IS IN POINT OF FACT LITERALLY THE OPPOSITE OF A PLOT TWIST - IT'S AN UN-TWIST! A PLOT-STRAIGHTENING!"""
"Underworld: Blood Wars is all about the slicing, shooting and mauling. Unfortunately, what I enjoyed about the others was missing in this one, and that is the love stories that were weaved into the action."
"Passengers is an incredibly creepy movie in which a woman succumbs to Stockholm Syndrome and falls for her stalker and stays with him even though the stupid ending wants to be ambiguous but it's not, this movie never met the concept of subtlety."
What this overly formulaic mystery never delivers is any insight into its characters or valid plot lines as to why they do what they do.
"Derivative slasher movies, as a genre, are over, and you don't have to be a film school student to know that."
The way characters interact with each other and the manner in which the master plan unfolds will stretch the credulity of even the most generous viewer.
"""The Fugitive,"" to which ""Angel"" owes perhaps even its rooftop finale, is a template against which this movie inevitably falls short."
"Everybody's Famous! starts out as a triumphant commentary on what it takes to achieve celebrity and the wealth it promises. But as the film progresses, it becomes wildly tedious and wacky."
"Pretentiously half-justified by a quotation from Sartre, facial close-ups are incessant and unwittingly humorous in this overlong dramatic love story."
"By the time the final twists and turns came to play I almost had to be nudged awake, the whole enterprise becoming so routine any chance of surprise or suspense is lost virtually from the very first frame."
"A film that lands in an uncomfortable space between understanding and mockery. Like its grouchy hero, it wants to be applauded for its tolerance, while also mining laughs out its characters’ differences."
"For what little goes right, there's so much going wrong. Many preachy montages, and the odd cheesy song."
"Things really get weird, though not particularly scary: the movie is all portent and no content."
"Despite several hilarious moments involving oddball classes and crude attempts to deceive parents, it's a teen movie by numbers and ultimately the maths don't add up."
"A painfully prolonged saccharine gunk tank, guaranteed to displease all ages."
"The movie-star-playing-a-movie-star-who-wants-to-be-a-real-person conceit also has an odd, chilling effect on Julia Roberts, whose appeal, overwhelmingly, is based on her seeming just like the rest of us."
Too overstuffed with conspiracy babbling and endless artsy nature photography to have a genuine impact.
"Despite its flaws, Curse of the Golden Flower is a diverting enough film, just somewhat flat compared to Zhang's previous epics--a little too willing, perhaps, to let story and action cede the field to costume and set design."
"Part of the problem with ""To the Wonder"" is that it doesn't offer credible characters, just postures."
Unfortunate that what had been a lovable comedy for adults has now become a dramedy for kids.
"Every time Forrest and Jewel go into one of their love chats -- in tight close-up, to go along with the grainy '70s-style cinematography -- the movie slows down a little more. By the end, it's barely breathing."
Questionable production values alone are not enough to sink a movie. Cinema doesn't have to look great if it has something to say. But it's not entirely clear what Public Enemies is trying to say.
The real problem is that there's absolutely nothing original here and it's obvious they tried to take what works and recycle it.
"The problem is not the violence, the standard abrasion static found in video games and juvenile TV. It is the lack of ideas, the paucity of story flow and dramatic imagination, the sterile, vacuum-packed cartooning 'directed' by Kunihiko Yuyama."
There are pleasures to be had...The question is whether those are sufficient to warrant sitting through the rest of it.
"If you took five different jigsaw puzzles, threw the pieces together on a table top and spent two hours trying to make a cohesive picture, you might end up with something along the lines of this."
"The film aims to be simultaneously a coarse sentimental little-guy comedy, a tale of embracing the American dream, and an increasingly serious underdog fight movie on the lines of Rocky. It fails on all three counts."
I can't see how people with low I.Q.s or those who love them are in any way comforted by all this hogwash. I can easily see how such people might be offended by its smug unreality.
The film provides a voyeuristic peek into the fantasy lives of nerds but becomes repetitive and tiresome in the second half.
"The sequel takes us to a labyrinth under the sea, but it might have been serviced better by a villain not motivated by simple inertia. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Cregger knows how to shoot, edit and score a film for tension. Now, he needs to work on placing characters in such stories who are clever enough to not insult our intelligence."
"Has all the earmarks of an enjoyable...contemporary thriller: intrigue, exotic locales, evil Russians...a John le Carr pedigree, and Ewan McGregor looking frightened. Unfortunately, the predictable sum is less than its potentially entertaining parts."
"Since the film is really an excuse to listen to the Beatles, you'd be better served simply pulling out the old albums or putting your Beatles' mp3 or CDs in a playlist on shuffle."
"Because it was produced by disgraced (and imprisoned) Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff, the movie is now loaded with an eerie unintentional laughter it didn't have for its original viewers."
"The filmmakers seem less clear on what really made those early Romero films great, which is something that, by definition, can't be re-created by any level of loving craftsmanship: They were timely."
"An Evening With Beverly Luff Linn is a wearying American comedy of grotesques that involves a lot of shouting, over-acting and Jemaine Clement looking and sounding like an Antipodean David Walliams."
"Queen Latifah proved that she could be watchable in awful movies when she made Taxi, although Beauty Shop never gets close to that particular level of badness."
"Passable animation for the younger members of the family, but the movie never finds its own voice."
"It's typical comfort food filmmaking and that's exactly what Safe Haven is: a mouthful of cotton candy. Empty, overly sweet, and likely to kill you from diabetes."
My open letter to Rob Zombie on his *cough* brilliant execution of Halloween II.
"A bewildering combination of anthropomophic perversity and environmental polemic, all scored to cheesy pop hits."
"At least on Netflix, no-one has to shell out for a babysitter to watch this on date night, but this slapdash film is strictly for the birds."
"Bills itself as part buddy-cop movie, part lavish fantasy, does neither justice, resulting in lazy nonsense that's too silly to be good and too self-serious to be any fun."
McConnaughey goes deeply method in a sleazy hedonistic adventure of messy misadventure.
"No matter how accomplished the performers, it's difficult to make tapping on a keyboard and staring at computer screens exciting."
"A clumsy, meandering film that will test your patience long before it has a chance to break your heart."
Just because I laughed doesn't mean Ride Along is a good movie.
"Despite some strong performances, never rises above the level of a telanovela."
"I want to believe this latest X-Files film was created for a reason other than financial reward, but I find it difficult to guess at what that reason might have been."
"Mostly, the inherent silliness of the original material reduces ""The Legend of Tarzan"" to mild camp."
"Carl Reiner, who has made his own contributions to comedy with Sid Caesar, Mel Brooks and Dick Van Dyke, does little to set a mood or rhythm or even an aura of good feeling that will carry audiences over the slow spots."
Army of Thieves is an enjoyable diversion with a winning performance from Matthias Schweigh&#246;fer and a stunning lack of purpose&#46;
"Despite some gratuitous, lingering shots of Bundchen with her scantily- clad cohorts and some equally heated, rubber-burning car chases through Manhattan, Taxi never really gets out of second gear."
A decent premise is ruined by poor execution and a ridiculous ending.
"The titular novel is written by an anonymous scribe who goes by the moniker Topsy Kretts (Get it? Like ""Top Secrets""? Yeah, I didn't laugh either.)"
"If you were at a creepy dinner party, and the hosts decided to show a video of their vacation in which they spent time with a crazy cult leader in Mexico, would you stick around for the main course?"
Cold Souls is less a movie than a cinematic decoupage that rips off pieces of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Being John Malkovich and blends them together.
"Has breathtaking scenery, but it's a lazy, meandering and unimaginative adventure with a poorly developed, frustratingly nave and dull protagonist."
"As it stands, ""Forks"" is an interesting and informative health lecture that's sandwiched into a dry, repetitive documentary."
"Recent examples of slim premises that boasted strong and muscular cinematic style, not to mention a sly sense of humor Miami Vice generally lacks, were Cellular and Red Eye."
Sweet but with no nutritional value.
"If Transformers 3 was produced purely to be an expose of what you can do with CGI in the modern era, it'd get full marks. It's truly is the ultimate showreel for Industrial Light & Magic. But it's meant to be a film, and sadly it's not very good at that."
The children in this movie are all self-serving ingrates.
"The picture disturbs more than it amuses, but the overall effect is ultimately as scattershot as the ammo."
"Nancy Drew is almost charming when she's out snooping in the boonies, but she doesn't make a whole lot of sense nosing around Hollywood wearing Bree Van De Kamp's hand-me-downs."
"Wrong, ugly and sad in so many ways."
"Jordan Peele nails his colours to the mast with a very entertaining, but also very obvious, horror number that seeks to satirise contemporary American race relations."
"If you've seen one swordfight, you've seen them all, and the convoluted screenplay makes the whole overlong affair feel like more of the same."
"When you make a film with Melissa McCarthy, Maya Rudolph, Joel McHale, and Elizabeth Banks, and there's maybe one mild chuckle spread out amongst the four of them, something is wrong."
"Unless you're an absolute sucker for puppy dogs and precocious girls, you might find your attention wandering."
"Marmaduke is exclusively manufactured for child use, and analyzing it would be equal to discussing the design of a rattle.  [Full review in Spanish] "
For a great part of the movie Francie just seems like a loud obnoxious kid with a big head
"Despite striking images and occasionally enchanting prose, pic is ultimately a humorless affair: It's hard to believe Cleopatra's vaunted erudition when she resembles a Playboy centerfold posing in an ancient version of Hugh Hefner's library."
"Grace may be based on a true story, but barely a moment in it feels real."
Jessica Alba in a bikini comes pretty close to being enough entertainment for the price of the film.
"An odd kind of a slog that manages to keep you partially engaged, even at its most esoteric or absurd, despite an endlessly excitable choir and Hans Zimmer's pitiless score."
"Visually stylish, what might have been a cute fantasy becomes tedious due to its banal script and a relentless overload of pig-jokes."
It really never deserved to be more than a quickie TV-movie on the WB&#44; where it would&apos;ve aired around Halloween and then faded into oblivion&#46;
"It's hard not to see the rabidly popular series's deliberate insubstantiality, its desire to address teendom in juvenile ways, as a depressing commentary on the dwindling standards of young entertainment consumers."
Oh how the mighty have fallen%u2026
Director Luc Jacquet struggles to dredge up the sort of emotion he delivered so easily in his Oscar-winning March of the Penguins (2005).
Don't Leave Home never finds a way to strike a balance between the real and the surreal.
This movie has so little to hide that you'll figure out whodunit long before the credits roll.
This is a heavy-footed reboot which doesn't offer a compelling reason for its existence other than to gouge a fourth income stream from Matrix fans...
You cannot make a convincing case against terrorism by showing one graphic scene after another of cold-blooded murder.
"Foul thriller, filled with depravity."
A lifeless attempt to fuse a taut crime thriller and a complex psychological drama.
"To his credit, director Asger Leth (Ghosts of Cite Soleil) gets right to the business at hand where the set-up is concerned, but it's in the execution that this would-be thriller falls flat."
Pacino slips in and out of a Southern accent so badly it seems like a joke he's pulling on us... Robin Williams plays Mork on heroin.
"It's a simpering, ineffective ersatz-drama, so simple-minded and unrealistic and so full of fussy stupidity, it exiles you."
Awkward and half-digested.
"Kristen Wiig's comic artistry and its melodramatic tinge are squandered in this frenetic, schematic comedy, which also lays waste to a fertile premise."
"(The film's) noble intentions are unquestionable, but the scattershot reporting keeps it from amounting to little more than a string of too-similar witness testimonies."
"""My Beautiful Laundrette"" is quirky and fresh and ambitious and pretty much everything a movie should be, except good."
Not even a super-powered Shop-Vac could clean this screenplay of its cobwebs. It's is dated and further flawed by plain old poor filmmaking.
"One of the most gifted actors of his generation, Philip Seymour Hoffman makes his debut behind the camera, even while starring in the title role, and the verdict is ... a deep disappointment."
"A muddled, sentimental Euro-American hash, redeemed here and there from its fatal purposelessness by a few moments that remind us we're in the presence of a genuine cinematic visionary."
"May be slick, but it's as cold and dehumanized as a robot."
A marginal adventure story from Clive Cussler's freewheeling novel.
"The movie becomes something close to suffocating. Taking it in as just another horror flick, though, requires suspending whatever you feel (and, for that matter, know) about the Mason Family and Tate's murders."
"The film exists to relish showing a promiscuous woman's effect on her testosterone-jockey colleagues and her provocative, self-loathing efforts at embarrassing dear old daddy and his West Point cronies."
"Ugh, this movie is such a f---ing mess."
It's a simple story that fails to transcend meaningfully.
"It's a movie so well-cast and meticulous that you want it to be better than it is, but you're left shaking your head, wondering where things went wrong."
"Looking For Eric is not so much a game of two halves as a chaotic kickabout, in which the rules of the game keep changing. It will score with some people but, I confess, I was looking for more."
"Mostly the movie just gets off on how awful and/or pathetic its characters are, calling on the viewer to judge or pity rather than sympathize with its gallery of grotesques."
"Eye of the Beholder wants to be an art film and a thriller. It fails at both aspirations. If you'll pardon the expression, there is far less here than meets the eye."
"The first film of 2016 should have been shot before it exited the paddock. Not only would it have been merciful, it would have saved me from 90 minutes of sheer tedium."
Less interesting than preposterous.
[A] scrambled spoof/romantic comedy/farce (the movie's own secret identity is never truly revealed).
"""Maladies"" remains on too low a boil to communicate any sense of stakes for the various characters. It seems to be trying to say something about creativity, and living one's life on one's own terms, but it's a muddle."
"It has an epic fail of a screenplay which, in a curiously heavy-handed style, anchors the events in a morass of talk about destiny. It gives off the impression of being about Christian belief but with little sense of what that means for those involved."
"If you're looking for retrograde sexual politics, then by all means Transformers is the movie for you."
"These are hardly damsels, but the distress will be felt by audiences watching the collection of non sequiturs, twee remarks and tangential vignettes that is Damsels in Distress."
Has some nice moments but overall is a failure in its exploration of the subject matter and it feels more exploitative than entertaining.
War in Iraq isn't funny -- neither is this movie.
"There are occasionally amusing moments, but the writing lacks the warmth that made School of Rock such a hit."
"To call this misty, low-risk collection of calculated revelations a high-toned The Bucket List would be a disservice to Rob Reiner."
"To be sure, there is a nobility to ""Nomadland,"" yet Zhao's film seems burdened by it."
"Poorly directed and appallingly edited sequel that doesn't even get the dancing right, let alone the plot, dialogue, characters and acting."
"There's nothing new here, just the same plot, the same romantic pattern that we keep seeing over and over."
The alchemic tang of peeled-back vice and possible insanity isn't there in Jerry Rapp's plodding screenplay and director Tim Hunter's tension-challenged execution.
Misses every target by a country mile.
Is It Really So Strange that This Charming Man is Unloveable?
"Dully written, ponderously paced and full of one-note characters acting exactly as we'd expect."
"A provocative portrait of the great man less based on history than imagination and abounding in cinematic clich, but showcasing a virtuoso performance by Cox."
"Too restrained and polite to really grip the attention, this feels more like comfortable Sunday night TV than cinematic fare."
"Unless you're a loyal Hart fan, his latest concert film won't bowl you over."
"Too much of ""Summering""... plays out in an unsatisfying middle ground: embedded neither in real life, nor in its heroines' restless, malleable imaginations."
Has neither the depth of character nor of theme to justify the condoning of her actions.
"Tim and Eric are vomiting their ids, replete with jokes about being covered in various different fluids (from rancid yogurt to semen), onto the screen. And that's sometimes pretty funny. But their kind comedy works better in short sketches."
"Conforms to a timeworn, and shopworn, Sparks formula of troubled protagonists receiving wisdom, or inspiration, or both, from unexpected sources."
As impenetrable as the [CIA] itself.
I was often disappointed.
An American Pickle is entertaining. It's just also too dumb for its own good and fails at presenting any meaningful social commentary from that stupidity
"... an indolent, PG-13, Disney ""biker"" flick that does for comedies what Exxon did for Prince William Sound."
"The audience, if any, for Chaos Theory is going to be hit with a little puff of celluloid flatulence. The movie won't linger in the air, but that doesn't make it any less embarrassing."
"Seriously. Bad. There, I just saved you 9 dollars."
"Both amusingly ridiculous and completely by the numbers, The Main Event makes for generally watchable (though very disposable) kid-friendly fluff."
A disappointment.
"Intent is far more interesting than execution, finding Serkis slowly losing control of his vision as the effort drags on, ending up with more of a curiosity than a triumphant reimagining."
"Every hand that reaches into a wardrobe, every nervous trip into that basement just gets on your nerves. Satan needs to get over himself."
"A low-rent neo-noir propped up by descriptions of, rather than depictions of, sexual kink and an odd interest in quantum physics."
"Plays like The Wizard of Oz or Alice in Wonderland crossed with a middling episode of ""The Muppet Show"" guest-starring David Bowie &#8230; suffers from a distinct lack of charm."
"Spectacle and special effects have saved equally bad movies in the past, but never one so hackneyed there's virtually no surprise or suspense."
"uneasy mix of sloppy sentiment and genuine mean-spiritedness that Sandler tries, and fails, to conflate with a schizophrenic performance"
We've frankly heard it all before.
The movie seems terrified of true psychological complexity or perversity. It's less a family tragedy than a lousy country dirge.
"An empty shell of a movie that goes nowhere, invokes no warm feelings, and accomplishes nothing."
"A few clunky scenes aside, Abandon still proves Gaghan's talent as a writer; his directing potential, however, is considerably less certain."
"After a long, storied career of engaging, thought-provoking films, Ridley Scott has succumbed to the gutless predictability that Pauline Kael initially envisioned, and Alien: Covenant is precisely the carnival fare she saw in the 1979 original."
"In summary it sounds familiar, but something has gone awry with the crowd-pleasing formula in this all-too-personal project."
Stephen Daldry's extremely labored and incredibly crass adaptation of Jonathan Safran Foer's novel.
"Because its focus is so split, the film lacks the pervasive sense of danger one expects from a spy thriller."
"My Son should be gripping, but it ends up just being lackluster."
"Got to give the Hoff credit. He knows he's the King of Cheese, and embraces it."
The viewer is torn between the admirable high-energy presentation and how incongruous it all seems when reflected upon as a whole&#46;
"The movie frequently feels lethargic, with moody characters gliding hither and yon."
"Freedomland is full of hauntings, institutional and personal, with Brenda burdened at last with speaking some version of ""truth."""
"Caf Society, starting with Allen's own lazily written and tiredly performed voiceover, is the retro movie of a filmmaker enmeshed in cobwebs."
"It may not be very scary, but at least it's funnier than Master of Disguise."
An effort that's somehow both depressing and trivial.
"While it's interesting, it's never truly absorbing."
I would rather let Justin Bieber punch me in the face for a week than spend another two hours watching V/H/S.
You want to like Ramon and what's more you want Ramon to like himself.
"We don't ask much of our legal thrillers beyond a twisty plot and a good villain to watch go down, and Brad Furman's methodical thriller doesn't bother offering much more than that."
"A plodding, incoherent mess starring Skarsgard and his abs, which look more real than any of his CGI jungle companions."
There's a distasteful brand of insincerity that pervades Me Before You.
"Intelligent and thought-provoking, but as drama, it fails to live up to its own high expectations."
Hollywood pats itself on the back for bringing low-brow entertainment to the masses.
"Films like this have a general necessity in providing alternative options for certain demographics, but it helps if they're attempting to do something; whether it be comedic or dramatic, but this little picture fails at both."
"Can a film be a compendium of clichés and still feel emotionally honest? ""The Way Back"" is a test case and, aside from the commitment shown by its cast, the answer is, sorry, no."
This film is silly and messy and pretty and trippy&#44; and though it fulfills the obligations of vweepy laser fights&#44; digital everything&#44; and several different varieties of product placement&#44; it&#8217;s not going to reshape the marketplace&#46;
"Surrounding and ultimately subsuming this ethical struggle is a fair amount of pediatric-cancer horror and mush, though Cassavetes is frequently bailed out by his cast."
The film isn't so much bad as it is dead--it pokes along at a pace that makes it seem about four times longer than it actually is and the occasional bursts of action are more perfunctory than anything else.
"The Number 23 can't seem to figure out whether it wants to be a paranoid thriller, a kinky murder mystery, or an M. Night Shyamalan-style Hook Movie."
Momoa&apos;s the best thing&#44; almost the only entertaining thing&#44; in the dazzling eye-candy kiddie fantasy &#8220;Slumberland&#44;&#8221; which suggests Netflix suits pondering the question&#44; &#8220;What would a children&#8217;s movie from the director of &#8216;Constantine&#8217; look like&#63;&#8221;
"First-time filmmaker Jordan Roberts worked on this project for years, but merely ended up with dreary cliche."
Complete crap. Idle and Coltrane have both been much better.
"There is not much originality here, particularly not a daughter wanting to escape an overprotective parent - Brave and Tangled did this much better - and the 3D hardly registers."
Sadly&#44; this footage&#44; pleasantly captured snippets of vacations in gorgeously soft Super 8&#44; subdues the raw literary horsepower of Ernaux&#8217;s compositions&#44; imprinting ease&#44; both placid and banal&#44; onto an author whose writing is anything but&#46;&#160;
"For the most part, Joe is an impressive creation, mixing CG, miniatures, and man-in-a-suit effects that don't age as poorly as one might assume."

Hello eyestrain! 3-D always was and still is a bad idea.
"Oprah's performance is passionate and solid, anchoring the film well, but Thandie Newton (the young London-born actress from Flirting) perhaps steals the show."
"Wounds will definitely gross you out, but there isn't enough meat in these bones to keep your interest through the millionth sight of a cockroach or jump scare at the sound of an incoming text."
Russell Crowe's satisfyingly nasty turn deserved a bit more brains to go with the brawn.
"Even though truth is often stranger than fiction, KIDNAPPING MR. HEINEKEN doesn't spark to life."
"Though Girls Rock! is nothing if not well meaning, it doesn't always feel like the best possible film on the subject."
Adds up to more of a whimper than a bang&#151;a thinly drawn female-empowerment lark without the spine to be as ruthless as it wants to be and without the smarts to be half as memorable as it should.
"We don't want to see Asia Argento talking about her history of drugs and wild sex, we want to see her doing it."
A labyrinth into which the plot tends to disappear.
Burdened by sloppy plot turns and unbelievable characters.
There are elements to admire - committed performances and noble intentions - but as cinema it's a non-starter.
The spy plot gets overshadowed by the cast's one-dimensional performances. [Full review in Spanish]
"Blash marshals considerable atmospheric forces, but his film collapses under the weight of oblique logic and plotting, lacking in either effective emotional payoff or the more skilled observational touch of a rumination on loss."
"This remake of the Danish film bravely tackles the right to die with dignity, but its commitment to theatricality lacks true stage power [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Director Matthew Parkhill seems perfectly suited for a career in any industry except filmmaking, and there's not a single beat of this film that I would describe as 'competent' or 'well-executed.' That's almost impressive."
"The unreal musical sequences in which crowds burst into renditions of Psycho Killer and The Passenger are fun, yet the film seems a bit too pleased with itself for coming up with something Danny Boyle might have tried 20 years ago."
"America's coolest actor, funniest new comedian and hottest directing talent have somehow conspired to make one of the most worthless films in recent memory."
"Disney can dress it up, take it out to the arcade and plug it full of quarters ... but at the end of the cord, the film's a simple, 8-bit I-gotta-be-me story, with a dull plot and tepid characters. Game over."
"Watts gives her all to this overheated nonsense, but is powerless to make emotional sense of what turns out to be the story's twisted central relationship, and ends up being just another fiercely maternal damsel in distress."
"This tension between self-expression and professional advancement is fascinating material, but first-time director-editor J. Clay Tweel avoids the nuance that might have brought it to life."
The movie consequently suffers from a lack of emotional resonance that's both unfortunate and disastrous...
"All the old Disney trademarks are here, except the wit and surprise that were once the studio's stock in trade."
"Embora limitado como ator, 50 Cent tem carisma para segurar o filme, que acaba falhando no em funo do rapper, mas de seu roteiro convencional que soa como plida imitao de 8 Mile."
The Forever Purge reads less like a horror movie and more like news headlines that offers no reprieve or semblance of fantasy. It's delivered with blunt force that makes for a grueling experience.
"BloodRayne is a visual joke, with Boll limply organizing a period horror/action film with all the confidence and subtlety of Baby Huey, and with about the same level of literacy."
"Waters' outlaw analyses of pop culture, always a crucial part of his films, have now started to consume them."
"A messy collision of strained portrayals, semi-comic incidents and tear-jerking tactics."
Cold in July is as cold as a corpse from an hour in.
Daddy's Home is not entertaining. It's a lazily executed painful waste of talented performers.
Even the grubby look would be forgivable were it not for the film's greatest crime. It's really boring.
"Davis could play a role like Bunnie in her sleep, Mulroney often seems to be asleep and the rest of the overqualified supporting cast just appears relieved that their screentime is limited."
Consistently interesting as intellectual fodder but so intent on not becoming sensationalistic that it's rarely emotionally compelling.
"We're not exactly sure what writer-director Sally Potter was thinking here, but whatever it was, she should never try it again."
"My Stretch of Texas Ground is trying to do some good and force us to empathize with a war happening on the other side...but if you're going to go out of your way to alienate your intended audience, then you're preaching to the choir."
"'A lily-white Southern California suburban high school can be a very dangerous place,' warned writer Seth Rogen, whose idea of danger is taking a week off from having his car detailed."
"The studio that hinges on creating magical family entertainment seems to have forgotten that magic, contrary to popular belief, is not created by adhering to formula."
"It seems as if Zappa had a good premise, but neither he nor Hedges could expand upon it without resorting to clich."
"If, indeed, it is true there are only seven original stories in this world, surely the super-hero comic genre's got a corner on the market on one of them. Now, even the people behind the mounting of this same-old same-old seem kinda bored by it all."
"To a short, sleek novel like Gatsby, where the slight action moves forward like a capricious swimmer, nothing could be more destructive than the slow pace and top-heavy lavishness and overexplicitness."
A valid premise hidden in a movie with too many obstacles to be understood. [Full review in Spanish].
The 1980 drama hasn't aged well.
"For something that creates a unique tone and point of view for the vast majority of its runtime, it is a disappointment to see Dual conflate ambiguity with indecision."
"If we're comparing Jake Squared to a mollusk's innards, it's more akin to a clam's foot, moving the vessel about from place to place but never farther than it has to."
"Stuffed with that snarky, sarky adolescent humour that so many modern screenwriters seem to mistake for wit."
"If the movie is respectful and factually informative, it's also tightly corseted -- in dramatic terms."
It never aims at anything more than the most superficial entertainment.
"[Barefoot], constructed of shards of other movies and a surfeit of bad ideas, is lacking in originality and positively perspires in its flailingly failed attempt to deliver quirky entertainment."
"A Halle Berry vehicle with four flat tires, this is the worst movie of the summer."
[Hopkins and Gooding Jr.] keep Instinct afloat on its sea of simplisms through a succession of climaxes until at last it reaches its unavoidable ending.
"Despite decent performances, this is a hugely disappointing, poorly conceived and badly directed thriller that ultimately fails thanks to the sheer contempt it displays for its audience."
... alternately charming and annoying.
"The ghosts of Shampoo, American Gigolo and even Alfie (both versions) cruelly haunt the ripe and raunchy frames of Mackenzie's Spread - another ""shallow-stud-in-need-of-redemption"" movie that pales in the face of its predecessors."
"While Crank has its moments, the line stringing them together isn't wound taut enough."
"Hulme is less able to fully gauge the emotional development of his main character, whose changes come with a little too suddenness."
Alone Together is a trite and misguided dramedy about a would-be couple stuck quarantining in the same house during the COVID-19 pandemic&#46; The only social distancing needed is for viewers to avoid this boring flop that fails to have any romantic sizzle&#46;
It would take serious mystical abilities to breathe life into this formulaic effort.
Last Vegas simply lacks the excitement you'd hope for.
"Has a genuine understanding of the protagonist, but ends up betraying him."
Though the film remains entertaining for a little while...the film eventually becomes the same sort of typically dull Farrelly brothers comedy most folks lap up willingly.
This material is wearing out its welcome.
Withholds emotional payoffs to an almost perverse degree.
"Dans Paris has a lot of whining about women, interrupted with impulsive trysts and bouts of dancing."
"Kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for (or worth rooting against, for that matter)."

"Building a documentary around recent conversations with Wilson as he drives around L.A. wasn't likely to yield much, and doesn't, in Brian Wilson: Long Promised Road."
"By the middle of the movie, it's as if every single plot point must wait until a tribal council convenes and pronounces on what should happen next."
A failed experiment with more than a few gleaming insights.
It's not that Monsters University lacks any of the heart or wit of Pixar's finest achievements - the attention to detail and sight gags are as impressive as ever - but narratively speaking this is derivative in the extreme.
"Feels like a joyless piece of exploitation, punctuated with embarrassing, witless dialogue."
"Forget Saw, I'd argue this is the most freakishly disturbing outing of Cary Elwes career."
"Lin's flashy sense of stylized grit is lost in a sea of sci-fi noise as ""Beyond"" becomes a monotonous blur of space babble and battles."
McKinnon mostly performs as though she's on her own. It doesn't help that the comedy is sandwiched between numbingly violent and repetitive action scenes that leave bodies strewn across the screen.
"2 Guns loses its charm amid multiple incidents of torture and brutality, including animal cruelty ..."
Antoine Fuqua is a dependable action director whose talents will never be maximised while the 1980s continue to be over.
The only experience more enervating than hearing about The Emperor's New Clothes is actually watching it.
"Somewhere inside the mess that is World Traveler, there is a mediocre movie trying to get out."
"Super 8 is a live-action episode of Robot Chicken, as delivered by a Steven Spielberg tribute band."

The story feels like a faded Xerox of an idea somebody once scribbled down on a napkin for an Allen-like comedy.
"A clunky doofus, a comedy of meet-cutes and weak jokes."
"It's not often there's too much of Cranston, he's one of the most entertaining screen actors around, but this is one of those times."
"By flaunting its own stupidity, The Ten practically dares you not to laugh at it, like a stand-up comic who sells an unfunny joke through the ferocity of his delivery."
This is the weakest entry in the trilogy. [Full review in Spanish]
A hybrid of sports movies and TV sitcoms with little originality and few surprises or memorably rough edges.
"The concoction seems far more contrived than plausible, but the sense of evil overkill is entirely representative of the picture itself, which repeatedly looks ready to blow all its fuses due to sensory overload."
What's worse than a listless sequel to a terrible movie? How about a listless sequel with a far less interesting cast than the first film.
"This should be a new rule for filmmakers: If the people you're following aren't as interesting as the real folks you know and love, your movie won't be much to leave home for or come home to."
"It's a weak hand from the filmmaker; not a colossal failure, just a dreary mediocrity."
"A new low for Nicolas Cage. Just when you thought he couldn't get any more apathetic about a role, he pops up in this lazy, boring retread of ""Insidious"" that even his most diehard fans should ignore."
"Just because Abduction is self-aware enough to acknowledge it's a rip-off, doesn't mean audiences will enjoy getting ripped off."
An oddly moralistic salvo for the anti-euthanasia set.
Tideland sees the fanciful helmer overindulging his dark side with a slice of Gothic nastiness.
...the movie's present-day sequences suffer from a dramatically-inert quality that grows more and more problematic as time progresses...
I haven't come across a fairy-tale premise calling for such childlike wonder and acceptance since the taxation of trade routes was in dispute and the greedy Trade Federation set up a blockade around the planet Naboo.
You're better off watching The Star Wars Holiday Special on YouTube. At least Bea Arthur sings.
"Altman said ""I'd like to do a love story where the leads are just ordinary schlumps."""
Too bad that so much really artistic work was wasted on this manufactured story.
Just a rehashed 'Twilight Zone' plot stretched over 90 minutes while Sandra Bullock stumbles around working on her 'baffled' face.
"Despite the best efforts of Derek Yee and Tsui Hark, Sword Master is a bloated action film with mediocre visuals and a cast that takes itself far more seriously than everyone else will."
The film grinds its gears when it tries to make its fantasy elements run alongside real-world logic.
Something of a prestige slog.
The familiar formula feels significantly watered-down the third time around.
"If anyone out there is looking for a movie that combines I, Robot with Upstream Color, you just hit the jackpot."
Bad Santa tries to be as vulgar and offensive as possible so that it might somehow justify the inevitability of its own happy ending.
What was missing for me was a story that was engaging or interesting.
"If not quite one of the worst sequels ever made, it's near the top of the list of all-time most disappointing sequels. Writer-director Stallone stupidly attempts to turn Tony Manero into a dancing Rocky."
There's more cheer to be gained from staring outside at a bleak and desolate winterscape in the twilight of a shortened day than paying good money to endure this example of cinematic offal.
Cusack could do for parenting movies what he did for romantic comedies. This is a rocky start.
Year One -- a film so simple-minded that even a caveman could have written it. Or could have directed it ...
"That Puzzle comes across as sincere but overdetermined may be the fault of its director, Marc Turtletaub...Puzzle certainly isn't a bad movie. It's mostly disappointing because it seems that it should be better than it is."
"A repetitive and pointless stoner comedy, it's never funny, interesting or even tolerable. I've rarely seen so many people checking their watches in a theater."
"Just short of completely inept. Nothing that needs to work here works: not the casting, not the script, not the direction, not the design, not the score."
"Sometimes irreverently hip and sometimes sweet, the spooky-house tale provides the best and worst in family entertainment."
"It's a movie about clones, which is fitting because this is a clone... - cool action, but it tries to be too many different kinds of films and spreads itself too thin."
"Although this story is unexpectedly macabre and sinister, the finale is easily guessable and better fit for a ""Twilight Zone"" episode than a feature-length production."
"Videogames are no longer brainless, so why are videogame movies so slow to evolve?"
"At least it is aptly named. By the time you realize you've been involved in a horrible mess, the perpetrators will have already sped off into the night."
"Sandberg often seems an artist bored by his own material, resigned to doodling in the margins."
"The film feels like the victim of too many rewrites and edits, with lots of plotlines that go nowhere or feel oddly unfulfilled."
"In almost every way, The Dreamers is a less sexy, less successful ode to the innocent passions and energy of a bygone era than Austin Powers."
"The crucial plot twist happens until half of the film and after that, the film fails at attempting to inject new vitality to the story. [Full review in Spanish]"
Srong on character and atmosphere but weak on story and excitement.
"Porn industry 1, Henry James 0."
"There are some good performances here, with Emily Mortimer as Veronica's flirtatious mother the highlight, but ""The Sense of an Ending"" is truth in advertising."
"This is not a feel-good movie. This is the frigid, hard-to-embrace cinematic opposite of a feel-good movie, in fact -- all wrapped in one long, dark metaphor for depression."
This is not so much a film as an amorphous blob that has suffocated the idea of a film somewhere within its vast and gooey structure
"A movie like Hotel For Dogs is so carefully demographically targeted, it takes the guesswork out of deciding whether to go. It is not a movie that kids and adults will enjoy equally."
the film sets up its main characters as specific types&#46;&#46;&#46;and uses them to feed those emotional viewpoints into a debate which eventually becomes repetitive&#46;
The film's indulgences are so heart-on-sleeve that it's hard to differentiate watching it from hearing someone pitch their very bad screenplay ideas with no attempt to read the room...
"An almost entirely forgettable buddy cop romp, save for Betty Gilpin's amusingly bug-eyed, scenery-gnawing performance."
A lazy movie that is interesting just at times. [Full Review in Spanish]
"The movie as a whole is such an incompetent train wreck, you can't look away, just to see how much worse it can get."
"Your mind though tends to wander - and wonder - during all the slow bits, which is much of the movie."
"Snatched might feature a great comedy duo in Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn, but the jokes rely too much on being gross rather than being clever."
"Artificial, manufactured and devoid of credibility."
Less about Walter Mitty&#8217;s secret life than his actual&#44; perfectly romantic&#44; impossibly realized adventures&#44; the film loses itself in a fantasy world all its own and never fully embraces the everyday balance of reality and imagination&#46;
"It's a lazy film, one whose future will most likely live on in mediocre undergraduate term papers. Oh, the humanity."
"In its own saintly manner, it's as exploitative as anything critics accused Django Unchained of being, minus Tarantino's eye for idiosyncrasy and sense of humor."
Precious with a capital 'P.'
The irrepressible Fisher sails through all the slapstick and shrillness and remains very likeable but the manic Confessions Of A Shopaholic does her no favours.
"Stuffed with cheap effects and devoid of tension, this French-Japanese-U.S. co-production contributes exactly zilch to the rich film history of those three nations."
"Too safe and solipsistic to be anything but a cheery, self-satisfied time-waster."
Maybe others will be affected by The Eight Mountains&#46; Maybe it&#8217;s a journey I haven&#8217;t needed to take&#46; But frankly&#44; I&#8217;m not sure that Pietro took the journey either &#8212; like the equivalent of reading a self-help book instead of going to therapy&#46;
"Didn't the International Court of Justice at the Hague declare ""We Built This City"" the audio equivalent of a war crime?"
What the film really expresses is political and moral cowardice masquerading as &#8220;timeliness&#46;&#8221;
"As summer confections go, Bewitched uses appealing ingredients and looks appetizing, but the result is as palatable as those cake decorations labeled 'not suitable for consumption.'"
"The new ""Valley Girl"" never fully finds its own tune, making it less a spirited cover version interpretation and more an of an unconvincing karaoke imitation."
Some handsome location shooting in New Orleans doesn't make up for the Oscar winners' relentless hamming and a plot that twists way beyond credibility.
"The gags, and the script, are a mixed bag."
"Flyboys is schlock. It's structure is predictable: comic moments, followed by an action sequence -- good from a distance, but as soon as we're too close to the pilots, everyone just looks ridiculous."
The feeling and generosity of spirit that fill the frame in the director's best offerings are conspicuously missing.
"mia hliara entyposiaki, minimalistiki binteoskopisi mias hliara apolaystikis synaylias, poy se fernei arketa prosopo me prosopo me ton Jagger, ton Richards kai t' alla paidia, oste na moiazei me kati poy tha mporoyse na ehei skinothetisei o Romero, kai se"
"Fine-feathered, somewhat funny - yet it's a quirky, outdoorsy expedition that fails to take comedic flight."
"A 3-D fantasy that's lovely to look at but less than delightful to know. It's insistently, relentlessly busy."
Austin Powers in Goldmember shows Austin is running out of steam and Myers should retire him before he fizzles out completely.
... surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs.
This efficient but soulless funhouse ride eschews suspense in favor of frantic scrambling.
"Even splatter-film buffs should be offended by this piece of nonsense: Not because it's so gross, but because it's so dumb."
Live and let this thing die already.
"The film is 101 minutes long. After the first 65, I ceased caring about any of it."
"The film's slow pacing... detracts from and defuses what is in other respects, one of the more interesting screen imaginations at work today."
"A lot of this is funny, and a lot of it isn't."
"If ever there was a movie equivalent of dad bod, Entourage is it."
"An earnest, heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives. It's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views."
Remains stubbornly mediocre without ever being actively awful. It's stuck in this dreadful oily neutral of being almost virulently OK.
Any picture that instantly recalls one of the worst movies of 2008 is off to a bad start.
"A film subject to various interpretations that does not invite to be solved, but to lose yourself in its amorphous structure. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Jokes come thick and fast in a film that plays to the cheap seats but may bewilder the younger viewers at whom it's presumably aimed.
"Devor has an eye; this is clear. If he trades some of the poetry for a little prose next time out, he'll really have something, whatever his subject."
"It has the wooden, self-conscious veneer of a vanity production."
"I suppose the way to watch this film, if you feel compelled to watch it by some masochistic tendency you are powerless to control, is to regard it as a comedy."
"...oddly unremarkable: less surely controlled than House of the Devil, less interesting in terms of form and, perhaps worst of all, not scary in the least."
"I would not have bothered to go see this except for the fact that I liked the first ""Ghost Rider"" movie, starring Nicholas Cage. This was a disappointment."
"Pesky things like narrative and character development only get in Nolan's way, to the point where I cannot help but feel his next film should abandon storytelling altogether."
The sumptuous dresses and hats are the best and almost the only reason to see the film.
"But by and large, the comedy is far from inspired. Watching people fall down and holler euphemisms for excrement seems to be the film's raison d'tre"
Surprisingly raunchy and unfunny holiday comedy. Disappointing
"takes itself too seriously, thus bleeding it of the pulpy, B-movie fun the title suggests"
"A special kind of bad movie, borne out of loopy misguided ideas rather than lazy, callous ones (the latter is far more common)."
"A glib, empty picture."
Moore and Brosnan add some small sampling of sophistication to a script that doesn't have any.
"I love where they're going with the dread, and you know death and dwelling on how insignificant we all are all that jazz, I love that about this film but it doesn't deliver as a standalone film for me."
"The tone is mawkish, the pace slow and both Sally Hawkins and Ethan Hawke overact horribly."
"For every odd laugh it earns, also induces twice as many groans for obviousness and coincidence-fraught comic straining."
A far-too-credulous William Friedkin goes to Rome to film a supposedly real exorcism in what is little more than an amateurish paranormal TV special.
"The brutality of Tyrannosaur, actor Paddy Considine's kitchen-sink directorial debut, isn't so over-the-top as to make Considine's sympathy for his flawed characters look like a sham."
"Overwhelmingly mediocre and pointless, contrived and lifelessly convoluted to the point of gibberish."
"Meet the Fockers doesn't have the shabby feel of some faltering movies, but its repetitive gags and toilet humor take much of the luster off the Focker-Byrnes wedding."
The Eagle isn't smart enough to be engrossing or campy enough to be a guilty pleasure.
"Not a total car wreck but has enough ""dents"" plotwise to make it less than a Pixar movie should be"
"A sappy subplot involving teenage daughter Paulina and her prom date is just a clich too far in a movie that makes rather too much of its references to The Exorcist, Poltergeist and Carrie."
"Cyrus has a likable, unforced screen presence but does not have the training or focus to show us any change more significant than the disappearance of the nose stud."
"The Mauritanian"" is buoyed only by Tahar Rahim's humane performance ."
... delivers the requisite spectacle... but skimps on character and story.
We Are What We Are is a superficially provocative movie that tries way too hard to be memorable.
Year-end releases reveal a plethora of fine actors vainly trying to apply their extraordinary skills to raise the quality level of mediocre films. Jennifer Lawrence in Causeway is a perfect example.
Film theory students researching the sexual content of movies by women directors are probably the only viewers who will be satisfied...
"Mirren and Sutherland are a very strong duo, and they carry The Leisure Seeker through its endless strange shifts in tone..."
Unfortunately for the toothless rabble-rousing School for Scoundrels this disposable and dimwitted farce deserves its smirking class to be dismissed.
"Cheesy sequel has some suspense, supernatural violence."
"If you want action and a convoluted plot, there's no need to wreak havoc. Let Jason Statham and Jet Li do that for you in ""War."""
"You'll have to be a cryptologist to figure out who's working for whom, and you'll have to boast the patience of Job to care."
May satisfy the faithful but can leave the casual moviegoer feeling as if he's walked into a bar where nobody knows his name.
"Simply serves Hollywood formula, while pretending to be above it."
Formula 51 is not good %u2013 it's not remotely good %u2013 and I hated myself in the morning for enjoying any part of it. But it was just too damn dumb to actually dislike.
"Quite apart from the equally apparent lack of the Coens's extraordinary visual acuity, Cut Bank comes up short because it simply presumes that guilt and evil already live in town, just waiting for us to arrive and see the show."
"Irvin Kershner directed the actors this time around, and without the benefit of Lucas's personal affection they seem stiffer, more clenched."
"If you're in search for a way to ogle Megan Fox's body, there are a lot better ways to do it than subjecting yourself to this."
"Long Live Rock is like a rambling ad campaign for hard rock/heavy metal's die-hard fandom. The documentary doesn't reveal anything new, the editing is horribly unfocused, and the movie often comes across as a long infomercial for rock concert festivals."
"The mammoths are cool. The squealing killer ostriches, perhaps inspired by ancient phorusrhacid fossils, are idiotic but... okay, they're idiotic."
"This will work for anyone who pays for a subscription to Brit Box and few others, but hey, at least it looks pretty."
"Over the course of 95 minutes of dim lights, dark clouds, and occasional tragic piano chords, the picture bogs down in its gloomy limitations."
The least concrete and most artificial of Buscemi's films. But that's as much because of the situation as Buscemi and David Schechter's slippery script.
"Devlin trots out every device since Silence of the Lambs in an attempt to turn this moronic plot into something watchable, but the spirit of the film feels in the wrong place."
"This campy, stripped-down summary of or sequel to Stephen King's cross-dimensional fantasy western is a late-summer bummer."
As predictable as a book you've already read twice.
"The Carmen sequences, though consistent with Callas Forever's washed-out '70s look, have a beauty and immediacy which the rest of the film lacks."
"just like the gifts one gets every year, Nothing Like the Holidays is a hit-and-miss entertainment experience."
"The X-Men have survived mutation, persecution, and supervillainous foes hell-bent on their destruction. But can they survive Brett Ratner? Well, no."
It is hard to feign real enthusiasm for something virtually entertaining.
"With the disinterest of one not being badgered into coughing up $18 a ticket, what I saw felt a lot like the Barbie's Playhouse version of Madonna's Truth or Dare."
"Feels strangely old-fashioned, despite its heavy reliance on digital technology... This minor movie might have been better if someone could have figured a way to stage it as a play, without any of the seemingly obligatory special effects."
"""The Bedroom Window"" engrosses you in theory more than practice."
"American Pastoral is boring at best, but it will play well to one audience-white suburban parents."
"Heavy on CGI, light on entertainment, 47 Ronin is a dreary and deathly dull tale that you will endure, rather than enjoy."
A major disappointment that is about as difficult to swallow as the Denny's meals that are among the avalanche of commercial tie-ins that have accompanied its release.
"A skimpy Cliff's Notes for both the eponymous Vaseline-loving sculptor-filmmaker's career and, specifically, his most recent act of cinematic self-infatuation, Drawing Restraint 9."
"More silly than suspenseful, this sleekly produced, high gloss piece of trash isn't quite in the so-bad-it's-good category of schlock films, but it comes mighty close, thanks to a gonzo twist of an ending."
"Once the paranoid surrealism of the opening scenes begins to fade, so does the film's inherent interest level."
"As well done as this film is in places, though, it's hard to be forgiving amid diarrhea jokes, hectoring, high-strung drama queens and heavy-set ladies swinging purses."
"Righteous Kill was helmed by Jon Avnet (the excruciatingly bad 88 Minutes) with the sort of phony, frantic energy that suggests a director with little faith in his material."
"The prize for preachy provocation goes to Pleasure, an art-house harangue..."
"Conviction is the kind of more-bland-than-truly-bad Oscar bait that, to its credit, displays genuine affection for its characters."
"Fantatical horror/thriller, focused on Christian fundamentalists with a sinister agenda."
"This film should have caused interest in the property to skyrocket. Instead, it left this reviewer ... disinterested in learning more."
"Despite efforts towards the end to import a little serious sentiment, much of the time it feels as though Mr Right is setting out deliberately to confirm every nasty stereotype about gay men."
There are many aspects of 'Dune' that work...But what 'Dune' isn't is fun. It's as if humor has been bleached from the future.
"If you've always wanted to hear inanimate objects argue with each other in the personas of Cranky Jewish Guy and Sassy Black Woman, this is a dream come true."
It packs the comedic punch of a devastating Third World earthquake.
Did Arnie have some decent motive for taking the money?
"A modestly chilling, drawn out affair in which the characters and possible ""scientific explanations"" are more interesting than its predictable final destination."
A bizarre tween movie vehicle for the High School Musical star Vanessa Hudgens that gradually morphs into a two-hour homily on the perils of adolescence.
"No surprises here, just a seen-it-before world domination plot carried out by a petulant Pharaoh with a head like a chewed pencil."
"If you've seen the trailer, then you've already seen a much more entertaining version of War."
... a dull summation of the more compelling back story from the first two films.
The story seems trapped by a Gothic seriousness that it must carry like a weight. The Cursed stands as a kind of mood piece interrupted by splashes of violence and spilled guts.
"This strained, empty effort doesn't work as homage or update, and in its darkly violent sensibility has neither the glamour of Brian De Palma's referential nightmares or even the narrative fuel of the serial-killer-obsessed procedurals that dominate tv."
"Because Arterton portrays Vita with an almost adolescent superficiality, her fixation on Virginia never feels like more than a conquest, or a rung to be climbed on the literary ladder."
"It's a sure bet the regular gore hounds will be disappointed by the film's transparencies, but will the faithful flock to a film that offers a lot more grit than the pallid stuff that generally passes for Christian entertainment? Ask Mel Gibson."
"Unfortunately, it also features some laughably bad CGI, a cringey storyline, cheesy dialogue and pro-China propaganda, with characters devoid of dimension and villains who are caricatures."
"even when the formula begins to show, you cant quite help but get sucked into it"
"In the battle of style versus substance, it's style by a head."
You know the movie is bound to be swill: imperialist daydreams indigestibly stewed together with limp Oedipal anxiety and unpersuasive pacifist lip service.
"This goopy dramedy is unfunny, mentally bankrupt and makes parenthood look like a terrifying death sentence."
"Considering the canvas the story provides, and the richness of the tradition it taps into, the amount and quality of the music is pretty disappointing."
Emotionally effective...(but) feels far more like a sermon than the cautionary/historical fable it was intended to be.
"There is no point here. This is a film about beautiful, rich, white, privileged teenagers falling in love because - oh, look - I'm so beautiful and the only thing more amazing than me is me falling in love."
"If you've got a house full of tots -- don't worry, this will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait till then."
The human element of the film is so weirdly distracting it often deflects from its primary target.
"The movie itself seems to be in mourning, which turns a crowd-pleasing look at a plucky dolphin and the humans who refused to give up on her into a joyless dirge."
Adding a new character in the final entry of a franchise and making him the film&apos;s primary focus is a choice that makes sense in terms of the themes present but not when it comes to concluding the story of Laurie Strode and Michael Myers&#46;
"Appropriating all the external trappings of big-budget fantasy but none of the requisite soul, this leaden epic never soars like the CG-rendered fire-breather at the core of its derivative mythology."
"It's a half-good film, but that's a small comfort when up to a certain point I thought I was watching something really special."
"Moss gives it her all, throwing herself into the role, literally and figuratively, with courageous abandon. Still, such attributes feel lost on a film far too content to render story logic and common sense as invisible as the bad guy."
"Lots of dull spots, a few effectively intense moments, and as much gore as the monster genre usually calls for nowadays."
"There are a few genuine scares in this fantasy horror movie produced and co-written by Guillermo del Toro, although it smacks of melodrama and manipulation"
"Hey, no Twilight vegan, goody-two-shoes crap here. At least this vampire sucks. Unfortunately, so does much of his movie"
"Zero chemistry, zero tension, zero laughs, zero everything."
"It is well-intentioned and occasionally has the odd moment of inspired wit, but it isn't enough, as the dough in this mix too often fails to rise to the occasion, even if it does have a warm touch."
Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance is so badly told that it ends up dissecting a corruption that exudes from nowhere but itself.
Robert De Niro on autopilot.
"Unfortunately, the history behind the film is more engaging than the movie itself."
"The Yokai War, when it finally comes, is pretty near an unmitigated disaster, filled with silly special effects and sillier action."
Bad movies are often propped up by incessant&#44; over-explaining&#44; &#8220;here&#8217;s where the ironic deadpan jokes are&#8221; voice-over narration&#44; and director Arne Feldhusen lets this script trap him in exactly that fashion&#46;
"Man of Steel plays like two movies in one. One film is the familiar story of Earth's invasion by merciless aliens. The other, better movie is about a young man discovering his identity and purpose."
"In this misguided romantic comedy, an actress (Jenna Mattison) is turning 25 and having a long-before-midlife crisis."
Dangerfield misfire comedy on several levels; little to smile about.
A bewildering disappointment.
"It's a missed opportunity to transform a problematic memoir into a meaningful statement, so terrified of becoming a political hot potato it opts to say as little as possible instead. Hillbilly Meh-legy indeed."
The movie piles on underdeveloped subplots and contrivances while the supporting cast and day players give performances so cartoonishly broad they can be seen from space.
"A standard issue, first-movie navel-gaze whose cobwebs Braff meticulously sweeps away by directing the bejesus out of it."
"Herself ticks off all the standard boxes of restoring faith in humanity, but it is a temporary and unmemorable high."
A Die Hard clone set inside a top-secret military installation that&#8217;s the last line of defense against Russian nuclear aggression&#44; high-octane actioner Interceptor is a waste of time&#46;
"Despite having fun scenes here and there, at the end the movie is little believable and lacks substance. [Full review in Spanish]"
"This critic admired Robin Williams's performance as well as some of the minor actors, but found the film's depiction of gay people more insulting to them than funny."
Zombie and company give us the proverbial razor blade in the apple with another crappy horror remake.
"Like many comedies attempting to exist in the real world, the numerous predicaments are far too severe to be approached with even a touch of sincerity."
"Although Hopkins shines when his evil-infused priest exhibits low-level nastiness, his climactic exorcism scenes don't ring true and aren't very frightening."
"The film never really coheres, and although some scenes are amazing, the total is slow, ponderous and sometimes silly."
"While there's a certain rough charm to the handmade virtual reality world [Rodriguez] creates, the movie still has the undeniable drawback that it causes a headache."
"It's too bad that the film's performance outside the bedroom is so unconvincing: the acting is dodgy, the storytelling is limp."
"The paper-thin characterisation of its main protagonist is indicative of a well-meaning but shallow approach. Rather than explode, this Bombshell just fizzles out."
"Pleasantly informative, if dramatically rather dim."
"The film is not altogether dreadful, although it's far from good. And that's not good. Classic stinkeroos are rarer than masterpieces, and we all need a laugh now and then, even if the laughs are inadvertent."
"The film is so single-mindedly determined to be light and comfortable, to not raise a sweat, that it forgoes even the mildest surprises. The only things that get heavy here are the viewer's eyelids."
. Plays like one long blonde joke we've already heard.
"After ninety minutes of one-note foreshadowing and Beautiful People acting carefree and idealistic, you're actively rooting for the Japs to bomb the snot out of them."
"Says so much that's familiar if not downright clichd, it winds up saying nothing at all."
"Willis, breezing through his handful of scenes, has perfected the right way to act in a Randall Emmett movie, with one eye always on the paycheck."
"Crudely-made in just about every possible way, Flashdance has only nostalgia going for it."
Seems recycled to begin with but grows increasingly tired and repetitive as the narrative drones on.
"In the end, this peppy number doesn't know which way it should swing."
"At one point Langdon bellows, ""I need a map showing all the churches in Rome!"" which is a hilarious bit of dialogue because you might as well demand a map showing all the bars in Milwaukee. Then again, that would lead to a more entertaining movie."
The intention is good - awkward sexual encounters and normal bodies make a great change from the usual romcom fare - but this is a missed opportunity.
"Kirsten Sheridan, who helped write her father Jim Sheridan's overcooked In America (2003), directs this awful drama, so soggy that her previous work looks positively austere."
"You're not going to die after you see this movie, but for the next 7 days you'll be haunted by the images and cursed with questions about why they keep making these sequels..."
A well-meaning but unfocused documentary.
"Despite all of its welcome and well-earned charm, Long Shot is ultimately to scattered to make much of an impression."
Hollywood animation can be boringly formulaic. And this one is all about some self-righteous moralising.
"Reign Over Me is like spending two hours with a shrink. Self-absorbed and repetitive, it has an occasional moment of truth, and a lot of hot air."
Most of the zombie footage looks like outtakes from Michael Jackson's Thriller video - minus the rhythm
"...a bad film, borderline inept, with an anti-erotic toxic charge about it. It deserved all the mean things people said about it."
"For a story about a shooting, Van Sant completely misses the target."
Damsel is one of those nouveau westerns that looks vaguely inspired by the Coen brothers... That type of genre tinkering can be refreshing as long as the writing is sharp. Damsel's writing is not sharp.
A featherweight romp that wants to flaunt stereotypes but instead winds up reaffirming them.
There is absolutely nothing original about Life. Zero. Nada.
"Unfortunately, Morris keeps his rebuttals to a career minimum in American Dharma -- bad timing, considering his subject is an active fire-starter, not a regretful, dried-out war hawk."
accepts no emotional stakes in its premise and gives the viewer only the simple task of reaching its finale
"Edgar Wright's new horror movie is a gorgeously-filmed spectacle (think London-Suspiria), but the second hour falls into routines. Still, I admire the man's vision."
"This movie has its tongue so firmly in its cheek, it's poking through and making a really nasty hole."
"Beauty and the Beast is simply a cover version of a chart-topping song, played with such anonymous competence that Condon's motto must have been, ""It ain't broke, don't fix it."" Another motto might have been better: ""If it ain't broke, don't remake it."""
I couldn't tell how anything connected to ANYTHING...
"Calling this the ""Sesame Street"" version of the Gospel would be an insult to ""Sesame Street."""
The picture features a choice ensemble of actors who are starved by the lack of a nourishing script and whose improvised quips and sallies fall far short of hilarity.
"Fans of the original stage play will most likely enjoy Stoppard's film version, but this treatment feels far less dynamic or lively."
"Bernie Mac has a talent for cussing. It's a talent that can take you pretty far in the entertainment industry, but it still can't carry a movie, as Mr. 3000 demonstrates."
A lot of movies aim for the lowest common denominator. Boat Trip is merely low.
Silicon Valley story of good versus evil-sort of.
"It's hard to name a recent sequel that has been more thoroughly unwanted, unneeded, and disposable."
Each scene in The King's Speech is so poorly staged that its ineptitude sometimes borders on the avant-garde.
"Paltrow provides the depth that the script lacks, making a lot from very little."
Strident and inelegant in its 'message-movie' posturing.
"A romantic adventure & quirky character comedy, with a warm center, but takes more than 3 licks to get to the center of this treat...largely whimsy with no heart."
Mr. Kechiche and Ms. Lacroix's gravest missteps here are their depictions of homophobia and the LGBT community itself.
...like most English language remakes of Asian horror subtlety takes a back seat to bludgeoning.
A brainless romp.
"At least there's Halle Berry in the driver's seat, and the force of her performance is enough to push to make this a half-decent recommendation for someone looking for a quickie genre thriller."
You may be surprised at how not torturous [the film is].
Yet another witless and asinine bore&#46;
"Imagine Del Toro's movies, except without any spark, wit, fun, tension and excitement. The film's shortcomings are so legion, it's almost impressive."
a lot like watching your computer's graphics card vomit.

The indie director of Swingers and Go has used his post-Edge of Tomorrow downtime to box himself into a cat-and-mouse sub-genre without identifying what psychological horror he'd like to explore.

It's like the whole movie is on amphetamines. Dark of the Moon is high-speed orgies of random bloodless ultraviolence... with some jingo-jism stirred in for an extra kick...
Peyton Reed wants to make a &apos;Star Wars&apos; film which is great for him because that&#8217;s clearly where his ambitions lie&#44; but it&#8217;s bad for the &#8220;Ant-Man&#8221; franchise because the strengths of that series&#8212; its humor&#44; its modesty&#44; its small-scale humanity&#8212;are missing

"Despite the skill and spectacle of the special effects, the prosaic storytelling is never interesting as cinema."
Once Upon A Time in Hollywood could have benefited much more had it taken a different approach&#46;

It is a shame the material lets [the cast] -- and the audience -- down at the very end.
"Keanu Reeves, boringly cocky FBI agent, goes undercover, and off the film lurches into narrative gobbledegook, surfing, and the spiritual utterances of a tanned guru (Patrick Swayze)."
Director Amma Assante and screenwriter Misan Sagay weigh down everything by introducing portentous melodrama and brittle social dramedy.
"What with the unexciting hand-held camerawork, and the off-putting script and lead performance, ""Francine"" remains as frustrating as its inscrutable title character."

A piece that needed a more calmly written script to find the balance the it required. [Full Review in Spanish]
"The film is typical sappy fare with 'little life lessons' being learned all over the place. It isn't the film is bad -- I, as an adult, found it just too predictable for this day and age."
"JT LeRoy may add to the overall mystique of the story when reviewed alongside the docs and books on the subject. Taken on its own, it leaves the viewer wanting more depth and nuance to bring things full circle."

Sing 2 is glossy and probably quite expensive (what with all the music licensing and the big name voice cast) but it's almost completely devoid of character.
"There's not much room for examining motives or moral ramifications in a story that funnels toward an inevitable conclusion, but loses momentum before it gets there."
"Allen's new film is largely stillborn. With more sadness than anger, one has to report that Magic in the Moonlight is largely devoid of wit, charm or ""magic"" of any kind."
"With the exception of the third film, this is the least funny of the bunch."
"The theatrical artificiality constantly upstages the Tolstoy tragedy, which turns this production into an endlessly annoying experimental film."
"For all there is to criticize, Holidate does surprise us by presenting a relationship with an age gap in a positive way."
"It's not a horrible idea for a movie, and the human cast is appealing. But the filmmakers stoop so low in their attempts to get laughs that it's all for naught."
Worst of all is this: there's not an ounce of fun to be found in the film's entire two and half hours (Splice Today)
"It's a little insulting to all the real reporters who've died in the field looking for hard information, not weak indie comedy."
This movie was charmless.

It's likely Justice will be of interest mainly to those tireless individuals who compile clip reels of Cage's worst moments and upload them to YouTube...
"As predictable as any of the old clichés about country music and men who write it, although that's mainly because Cooper's script ... uses so many of them without delving any deeper."
"Rambling and unfocused, the film doesn't do justice to its subject. It will be a perfect fit for PBS fundraisers, however."
"The movie feels like an info dump, and since so much of that information is intended to bolster an argument, The Man In The Machine's ""and here's another thing"" shapelessness becomes frustrating."

"It's not Leo's fault, but this shallow, conventional biopic is a snooze. On the Eastwood scale closer to Flags of Our Fathers - Serious, Important, Dull - than masterful."

"A journey that's too tiring visually, too rushed narratively speaking and efective just to deliver entertainment. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The problem, then, is that all of this build-up has to lead somewhere, and once the narrative has to start revealing its secrets, it too quickly runs out of steam."

"Rogue Nation has a plot with means and opportunity galore, but little in the way of motive. And in a year brimming with spy stories, you need to bring your A game to stand out."
The recent 3D Lovers Guide was sexier and more three-dimensional.
"Not to sound too much like a bratty teen-and these bachelorettes should know better-but, um, why should I care again?"
"Maybe there's more to this story, and perhaps the keen observer is meant to understand that things are very wrong, but does it have to feel so hopeless?"
"The classic teen movies tend to resonate more with actual teens, but while high schoolers may find this movie unbelievably innocuous, it's a sweet enough diversion for young'uns and the parents who have to accompany them."
"Chasing Liberty is a comedy with no sense of fun, a romance with no passion."
Management is ultimately undone by its own bland idiosyncrasies. It's nothing but a mismanaged opportunity.
A mundane car wreck with a few promising scenes that lead absolutely nowhere.
"Youth is a bizarrely disjointed affair, never less than visually stylish but quite often less than comprehensible."
"Astoundingly dull, The Aviator should be revisited purely by enthusiasts of its two leads or those looking for a visual sleep aid."
&#8230;a lethargic&#44; uninspired and rather inessential adventure propped up by extended cameos&#8230;
Characters that don't work and a stylistic approach by Jordan that doesn't give the give the piece the personality it needs to be considered as more than an arthouse Twilight.
"Someday, when Samuell finds something to say, he may make a great movie. For now, he's only playing games."
"Blue Velvet is a beautiful treatment of ugly material. Unfortunately, it is just ugly enough to fascinate a lot of people, particularly weak men who have been made to feel subjugated and insecure by women."
The surprise ending here is as bad as Sixth Sense's was good.
The opening and closing sequences of Wakanda Forever will make your heart ache&#46; But at 2hrs 41mins&#44; this is also one of the longest films in the MCU&#46; And there are long stretches in it which border on boredom&#46; I was weepy but also weary&#46; 
A few clever lines dispersed throughout don&apos;t make up for a complete abdication of character-building in this weak script&#46; 
A genuinely fascinating piece of American history reduced by Woo to a near-psychopathic bloodbath full of transparent jingoism.
The film has that one slo-mo trick and milks the cow until there's less beef than a Wendy's Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger.
Just plain awful.
The only notable development is just how rapidly a satirical skewering of genre formulas can become thuddingly formulaic.
Rafelson concocts mediocre entertainment at a high cost. 
"Had this blood-soaked exercise in mayhem been written and directed by anyone other than Christopher McQuarrie, who wowed audiences with his script for that barrel of red herrings, The Usual Suspects, it would have probably gone straight to video."
Ron Howard's third (and weakest) stab at a Dan Brown adaptation...
An efficiently staged but credibility-stretching international thriller that never quite lives up to its Hitchcockian potential.
"Instead of moving into any humorous exploration of the underlayers of the human condition, Bedos presents everything a bit like an outdated vaudeville-esque show."
Sappy...it feels like they wrote themselves into a corner...
"In terms of representation, you couldn’t ask for more. And that’s just as well, because in terms of entertainment, you could barely get less."
"Its flawed central performance ultimately makes ""Solo"" a distinct disappointment."
"For all of the detail the movie throws at you, it is about as realistic as Superman III when it comes to computers, and Hemsworth is just as realistic a hacker as Richard Pryor was in that film."
"It's a shame to see Charlie Brown, one of our culture's most lovable nonconformists, swing for the big leagues and whiff."
"The movie plays out like a particularly unfunny, dysfunctional family sitcom and features even less action than its predecessor."
"Short on story, long on insider humor, this Spidey entry marks a sudden drop-off in quality."
"As one character asks, ""It never stops, does it?"" Well, no. Not as long as people keep paying to see such dreck."
"A sometimes humorous, often damning but also disingenuous attempt to ""Michael Moore"" the United Nations."
"Completely miscast with uninspired production, this remodeling of Blithe Spirit is a faint shadow of its Coward roots, a resurrected retired poltergeist without its same purpose or vigor."
Was Teddy the Fredo of the Kennedy boys?
The only element of The Garden worth marvelling at is the amount of money seemingly lavished on its production design.
"While the film isn't without its joyous moment, the poorly constructed screenplay leaves a lot to be desired."
"This film by director Bruce Beresford (Driving Miss Daisy) is a formulaic, multi-generational story about a New York City lawyer on the verge of divorce who goes home to Mama, a pot-smoking denizen of Woodstock."
"Ultimately, the film's good intentions when coupled with Millie Bobby Brown's charm only make for a passable feature."
"Producer/writer Zack Snyder has recreated the depth of King Lear, only elevated to the sophisticated level of a YouTube comment thread."
The film doesn't go far in reviving the Western film genre.
"The raison d'être of Going the Distance is exploring long-distance relationships. What a shame, then, that it has nothing much to say on the subject that isn't completely obvious."
"...the movie is mainly for the benefit of children, a good thing because the world will soon enough be in their hands."
Greater than the terror that Jim Carrey's character...feels in the course of The Number 23 may have been that which Carrey and his castmates felt midway through production as the glowering awfulness of this project began to dawn on them.
"Qualls is a good performer, has a true sense of comic timing, and will hopefully appear in films of higher quality in the future."
"Schlocky, sluggish shoot-'em-up."
"What follows plays a lot like National Lampoon's Vacation, only without that film's refreshing sense of cruelty"
"Even when The Walk inspires the eyes, the brain registers little but banality."
A very lazy movie. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Have we really come a long way from chick flicks about women expressing friendship by nursing each other though divorce, cancer and other common losses, to movies in which women can only express love through a windy haze of carnal chatter?"
"There's a lot going on in Running With the Devil, but also somehow absolutely nothing at all. It jumbles together too many storylines, drug movie clichés, flat characters, and an epic cast of B-movie all stars."
A lot like every other Ashton Kutcher movie - BORING!
"There's a shred of an interesting idea in Mr. Jones, but the film is far too unfocused, sloppy, and downright dull to leave any kind of impact."
"An uneasy blend of broad comedy, raunch and mayhem -- a typically wobbly outing from a filmmaker who's watchable only when she's got Tom Hanks on board."
"Who cares if the story makes sense, because Michael Shannon can carry it, right? He can, but only so far."
"When the best thing about your movie is its unfamiliar location, you know you have a problem."
"Dull and programmatic in equal measure, The Ones Below seeks to thrill with its Polanski-tinged pregnancy drama but mostly ends up insulting its audience's intelligence with an obvious endgame and cheap stabs at paranoid dread."
The Girl in the Spider's Web is content to simply reimagine her as something jejune and small: it turns her into a superhero.
"Something bizarre starts to happen around the halfway mark, perhaps because no one knew how to develop the original premise."
"Rockwell has an off-center charm and, as his gorgon mother, Anjelica Huston is more imposing than this movie deserves."
It'll take decades for the 210 million gallons of oil spilled by the Deepwater Horizon to be absorbed back into the environment. It only took Hollywood six years to rework disaster into entertainment.
"Tries so hard to be this generation's The Big Chill that the very reason why it exists - sexy, gross out, adolescent fun - feels thoroughly out of place."
How do you screw up the parting of the Red Sea? How does Ridley Scott?
"This heavy-handed melodrama represents one of Tyler Perry's weakest efforts ever, and that's saying something."
No geezer jokes for Rambo and the Terminator in this one.
A story that strays about without finding its center.
Jessica Lange establishes a spark of interest in this psychological thriller with her giggly demonic performance. But the film never adds up to anything more than an elaborate tease.
While it generates some scattered laughs&#44; this zany comedy undermines its playful lo-fi charms in the second half&#44; when constant mayhem strains any broader efforts to feel relevant&#46;
"If ""Wonder Park"" were a carnival attraction, it would be the merry-go-round. The animated movie has animals, relentless positivity and the most predictable journey ever."
"Deepwater Horizon brings together Mark Walhberg, Kurt Russell and John Malkovich in a disaster flick with relatively little redeeming value..."
"Romain sees his inner child wherever he goes. The problem is, that childishness is all we really understand about the character. Nothing else punches through."
Its charms are too slight and fleeting.
"The film is all kinds of ridiculous, but if you like campy horror..."
"Though Kajillionaire is well-made and definitely feels part of the artist's body of work, Miranda July's penchant for twee strangeness often overpowers the sadly sweet narrative."
"The dark humor that made [the original] really daring, strange, and cool just somehow gets lost here."
"More crass than charming, this ill-conceived reboot is so overstuffed with self-promotion - both for its star and its studio - that you practically expect QR codes to pop up in the corner of the screen."
"[E]very closed door must be opened at some point, and it's in this regard that The Woman in Black cannot fulfill the promise of its moody backdrop."
We are left with something much less thrilling-the rage of a woman scorned.
Taken 2 grabs everything that was surprisingly enjoyable about the original film and batters it into the ground like... Liam Neeson beating up an Albanian human trafficking ring.
An unwatchable mess.
"When Snow rides into battle wielding a sword, you want to tell her to put that thing down before she pokes her eye out."
"It's got some interesting ideas packed inside cool cinematography and high-octane action, but those things come at the expense of plot and character development, making it a fairly typical summer popcorn movie."
Visually impressive but ultimately unrevealing.
"The gags are all over the map after that, a hodgepodge of humor that can't decide whether it wants to be mean-spirited satire or play it safe for a mass audience. The result is Cohen's weakest film to date."
"A moody, hipster rendition of Mary's story, reduced to a litany of whining."
"Sadly, The 15:17 to Paris is an all-time career low for Clint Eastwood."
Denmark's charmless answer to The Hangover crosses the line between gross-out and just plain gross.
Seeing Hopkins do his deadpan routine is The Rite's primary attraction.
"It's mindless, but it's well-paced."
"Despite its meticulously detailed gore, Jigsaw is rarely scary."
"Now we know how the world ends -- with a whimper, a very loud whimper."
"Hudson, however, can't be blamed for the story going to pot. It never does regain the hypnotic appeal of the initial sequences. Yet Hudson actually turns in the most forcefully convincing performance of his career."
It comes dangerously close to being America's first sex comedy without comedy.
Mohanlal hams to embarrassing levels as the team of Monster tries to camouflage their closeted conservatism.
... lacks consistent suspense and relies too often on genre cliches instead of the clever twists that such material usually commands.
"Nacho Libre, naïvely made kids' stuff, lacks such minor attributes as a decent script and supporting cast."
An ultra-lame sequel presumably hoping to capitalize on the surprise success of the 2017 film. Um yeah... no.
"A predictable, emotionally unengaging, and occasionally corny story."
"The movie takes a refreshing stance in favor of family life, but the repetitious story moves erratically and runs on much too long."
"It's a weak structure, thinly tied to the picture's tired and antiquated theme about Alice reclaiming her ""muchness"" and defying societal expectations."
"definitely something different, even if it doesn't quite live up to the filmmakers' obviously grandiose ideas"
It's proof that slower doesn't always mean better in horror.
[Kenneth Branagh] makes a simple mistake; he leaves his mark all over the crime scene. [Full Review in Spanish]
"“Alice,” the movie, dares to go through the looking glass, but it doesn’t entirely know what to do once it gets there."
"Deserves to be scraped from the lawn, bagged up and dropped into the wheelie bin."
It's a pity that the premise exhausts itself too soon... [Full review in Spanish]
...this insidious movie has it both ways by back-dooring the entire U.S. criminal code -- for the sake of some boogeyman-based lesson in intelligently designed fake morality.
"Why does Saala Khadoos fail to land the knockout punch in spite of getting a few hooks and upper cuts right? Despite the many promising situations that it rustles up, there is little room in the well-intentioned yet rough-hewn drama for genuine surprises."
A lot of hot air.
"In the first film, the horse was stubborn. In this movie, he drinks, belches and smokes a pipe. Seriously, a burping horse! Ugh. It's like a bad cartoon."
"Chan often looks as tired as the script, and as bored as the viewing audience."
"Rob Schneider serves up a veritable buffet of tastelessness in ""Deuce Bigalow: European Gigalo."""
"""Safe House"" devolves into unexciting action scenes that feel left over from the ""Bourne"" flicks and are peopled with cloak-and-dagger stereotypes."
"Lurid, ludicrous and often confused."
"Although it's essentially a glorified special feature for a concert DVD, it's a fitting eulogy for fans (and fans alone) that is thankfully not overwrought with sentimentality."
"Calling ""Zoolander 2"" the character's identity quest is a stretch. His time would be better spent trying to find himself in the nearest black hole."
"On paper, the teaming looks solid gold, yet the film is an experience that results in more yawns than goosebumps."
"Velvet Buzzsaw, flaws and all, is begging to be absorbed by internet culture, full of moments just waiting to be turned into memes and gifs for Twitter reaction shots."
"In true soap style, it turns out that virtually everyone is harbouring some sort of dark secret that can be conveniently exposed whenever it looks like Meryl Streep might be running out of things to shout about."
"It's fine to have no remorse, but some heart would be appreciated."
"There's plenty of shimmying here, maybe too much, and lots of spin moves, but it's missing on-the-field results."
Tries to blend chick flick staples with bro humor but never quite gets the mix right.
Basically a self-serving justification for the prominence of fluffy entertainment over sharply written and intelligently crafted stories.
How disappointing that Land of the Dead is a familiar rehashing of what Romero already covered in Day of the Dead.
Descent is the head-slappingly awful picture that turns rape into a comedy.
A small-time film noir that is remarkably -- and disappointingly -- ordinary.
If you've ever wanted to see Paul Walker get repeatedly smashed in the teeth with a hockey puck then this is the movie for you.
"Gross, no fun."
"Here is a film that doesn't just scrape the bottom of the barrel, it demands that you lick it."
"Suspense psicolgico rasteiro que, apesar da boa atuao de Sarandon, se perde irremediavelmente em seu ato final, quando abandona qualquer pretenso de inteligncia e se entrega ao absurdo."
"Well-shot, well-acted and, well, kinda boring."
You don't have to be a genius to find yourself several steps ahead of this helpfully titled mystery thriller.
"The first question you'll ask yourself while walking out of The Canyons is, ""What were they thinking?"" The second may be ""Were they thinking at all?"""
The film was about as uninspiring as reading GQ.
This is one of those productions that is easier to admire than it is to like.
A stilted but cordial B Western set in the pre-Revolutionary Mohawk Valley of New England.
"Navel-gazing director Michel Gondry (""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"") wears his developmentally arrested heart on his sleeve, on his pants, and on his forehead in the most self-indulgent movie of 2006."
"At least he's being honest: Johnny English Reborn makes no attempt to hide Atkinson's shameless thievery, his lack of invention or even his graying hair."
"Although French directing duo Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury add some extra griminess and the central mystery is clever enough, Leatherface never truly escapes just how pointless and misaligned its whole set-up is."
"At 33, LaBeouf has come a long way... But as a writer, he wallows."
"The film can be recommended to parents of headstrong children who are up for a wild, frequently entertaining, but not always coherent ride. Everyone else might want to download the Disney screensaver."
"There's a Fitzgeraldian sense of generational malaise in all of this, but ""Lola Versus"" is convinced that it's hilarious."
"Despite dealing with a journey, this confused and confusing movie seems to go nowhere."
...a hopelessly forgettable effort that seems to have been assembled around a series of admittedly strong one-liners (ie the story is generic to an almost absurd degree).
Tracers gets a few things right and completely forgets about others.
The Fan is junk.
Hansel and Gretel is a bloody mess.
a few shocks amid a lot of voodoo hoodoo
"Trashy pulp, with grim humor, plenty of stereotyping, and lots of surprisingly explicit carnage, along with a faddishly feminist slant: but it can be enjoyed as smoothly executed low-rent junk."
Writer-director-star Martin Donovan can't connect the dots; the film is a ponderous bore.
Even the look seems to be at odds with the material.
"There are plenty of no-budget movies worthy of grassroots movements. 'Fanboys,' which comes with a built-in fan base only by virtue of its connection to a universe George Lucas created, isn't one of them."
It's a sign of the half-baked nature of the film that Sawyer is continually being upstaged by his own artificial foot.
"A fatuous argument for Mother Teresa's sainthood; credulous and willfully ignorant, and disregards everything about her beliefs that was nasty or skeptical."
"If you find hedge funds hard to wrap your head around, the movie ""Human Capital"" won't do much to ease the confusion."
"Collateral Beauty had the potential to be great, yet even with a stellar cast and a seemingly heartwarming idea, the film failed to deliver what it promised its viewers."
"Kitschy '90s sci-fi horror, lots of cursing, some gore."
"Frankly, I feel like a lot of the intangible 'heart' of the first movie is replaced here with an ongoing conversation about sex."
Rambo combines an unapologetic return to the grand action-movie tradition of blowing **** up with a Saw-era interest in close-ups of human viscera. The problem is that the moral meaning of the gore keeps changing.
"The story is a classic fish out of water, bromance vehicle that many TV-to-film stories follow when they first make the jump onto the silver screen."
"To see No Reservations is to see what's wrong with a lot of American movies. A remake Mostly Martha, it takes a winning recipe and adds some distinctly Hollywood flavors: It takes adult characters and has them behave like children."
"Poor Kirk Jones, who directed Nanny McPhee and Waking Ned, can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear of a script. But he could have left out the golf cart chase."
"For all his command of adrenalized, propulsive narrative and his dazzling technical facility, Aronofsky's study in female hysteria ultimately favors frenzy over compassion or insight-and remains strictly skin-deep."
More of the same...[Full Review in Spanish]
"Because of the fundamental emptiness of his American vision, all sorts of flaws that one might overlook in better Antonioni films become apparent."
"Walking out of the movie I was mostly disappointed, since I felt that there was something there that could've been great, but instead was ho-hum."
[Director Chris] Weitz seems to have taken the vampire thing a little too seriously -- his bland brand of Hollywood polish sucks the life out of the movie.
"Makes ""Bombshell"" look like a masterpiece."
It all culminates in a climactic showdown during the reality show's frivolous final that's so terribly staged and written I nearly slapped my forehead in disbelief.
"Patsy and Edina should have been left in their decade, where we could imagine them partying it up and smoking weird substances with the Spice Girls and Liam Gallagher. Bringing them out now does no favors to them or us."
"With a script by Susannah Grant written as if in bumper stickers, fortune cookies and Oprah transcripts, 28 Days is the kitchen-sink rehab flick."
"""Gimme Shelter"" strives to be a gritty drama about an abused teen struggling to find a better life. But it comes across more as a calculated vehicle for a former teen idol to find better roles."
"Despite my interest, there are several elements to The Water Diviner that left me puzzled. Embedded throughout the film is a layer of ""spirituality"" that borders on science fiction."
"If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then ""The Collector"" flatters the heck out of ""Saw."""
"Despite a few solid scares and set pieces, as well as a killer ending, Truth or Dare's embrace of cliche and lack of internal logic makes it stand out as a lower tier Blumhouse affair."
"... Alex Cross is certainly the weakest of the series, which reportedly will continue with Perry in the next film. God help us all. We can only hope for the best with that one."
"Chris Rock is funny and talented, and so I have said several times... This project must have looked promising, since the directors are brothers Chris and Paul Weitz, fresh from American Pie. But the movie is dead in the water."
"Frankly, even with the extra money, Bluth's team doesn't have the pizzazz of Disney."
"In a year of mass culture that gave us HBO's excellent ""Chernobyl,"" ""Joker"" can claim the grimmest depiction of a meltdown."
"It's difficult to feel positive about Romain's acceptance of his mortality, because Ozon hasn't convinced us Romain was that alive to begin with."
Scream movies used to be different&#46;&#46;&#46;they&apos;re now cleverly package horror films that are becoming just as generic as the films they used to so cleverly butcher&#46;
David Ayer is of the realist school of action filmmaking and this doesn't jibe well with fantastical fights and outrageous cartoon characters.
"It succeeds in flashes, but the movie's mixture of humor and inspirational fluff never quite meshes."
"It's hard to make a romantic thriller click in the best of circumstances, and this one takes low aim at a young audience weaned on gross-out gags."
"The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy was created in different times, humour-wise, and some of the laughs in the movie seem dated."
"[Chechik] has crafted Benny & Joon not as a seamless whole but as a tumble of scenes. Unfortunately, too many of them are inspired by Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd or Buster Keaton, and they seem to spill from the screen like Bozos from a kiddie car."
"Simply put, it's not very scary, and its efforts to do right by the material forget the most basic reason for going to see films like this."
"A generic, by-the-numbers genre exercise that, for all its talk of blood, is strictly anemic."
"It's neither grand nor grisly enough to seriously satisfy Poe-ish cravings for murder, mystery and literary allusions."
I get why Slumdog Millionaire is getting all the raves. It's well done and it's the kind of movie that gets people's attention. Just not mine.
This is actually a movie you forget while watching it.
Straight-ahead action would have been more than sufficient.
"It makes absolutely zero sense at times, especially in the frantic and bonkers third act."
Miss Bala does something that few films manage to accomplish: set out with a specific goal in mind and end up doing the exact opposite.
The script is a mess.
"The film's hilariously overblown housework-as-grieving climax, complete with cleanser cans being thrown in frustration, has to be a cinema landmark of some sort."
The infinite monkey theorem is far more limiting on solely the film front&#44; as it posits that a monkey screeching orders from the director&apos;s chair will almost certainly create a Michael Bay movie &#40;like this one&#41; at some point in time&#46;
"Earnest and well-intentioned but ultimately inert, ""The Monuments Men"" talks a better game than it can deliver."
Embarrassingly amateurish.
"Whereas Mary was thoroughly inhabited by all manner of absurd types, Irene has only a tagalong albino waiter."
... Mifune: The Last Samurai is a perfectly serviceable documentary on the great Japanese actor Toshir Mifune if you aren't looking for any information you couldn't find on the man's Wikipedia page
The best of all the Madea films.
Caruso constantly takes the movie down blind alleys while emptying his always-handy crime-movie handbook of every artificial plot device.
"What's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete, if irritating, notion of class."
"A few jokes, a few jolts, a few stereotypes -- a much more conventional ""found footage"" film."
...squanders an assortment of personable performances...
A flat retread of a comedy that was already moribund.
Any horror fan knows the entrance to hell is in Brooklyn -- a fact established in Michael Winner's The Sentinel -- and no attempt to transfer this accolade to Paris is worth considering.
"It's a font of tired jokes and off-colour routines; aggressive one minute, maudlin the next. Steer this one gently into a darkened room."
"Removing the ""the"" from its predecessors' title not once but twice, Fast & Furious's abbreviated moniker harkens back to the series's 2001 original while simultaneously expressing a tough curtness that marks it as its own model."
"In fact, the piece that sticks out the most is dubious: The script spends an odd amount of time depicting Eichmann's family life, and it borders close to sympathetic at points."
Terrifier is more or less a slasher proof of concept&#46; It introduces its two best features&#44; Art the Clown and the practical gore effects&#44; and executes them very well&#46; Unfortunately&#44; the movie lacks a story or any characters to invest in&#46; I needed more&#46;
"It feels too much like a marketing-driven gimmick - it's a chick flick with sports, you know, for guys!"
acerbic but overstated satire
It's a vehicle for OutKast's music and personality in which the music and lead roles feel like afterthoughts.
The movie then works vigorously to squander both talent and timeliness.
"Before long, this disappointingly limp thriller devolves into something much more generic, relying on slasher movie tropes and a wildly improbable plot twist for its effect."
"Titan targets teens, but misses mark."
A bland sitcom posing as a star-studded feature film.
It's a trite jumble that confronts its ripped-from-the-news theme as an impersonal check box.
"Liz Friedlander's ""Take the Lead"" is a fine example of how all the good intentions in the world can't make a poorly conceived movie good, though a good central performance can at least make it bearable."
"It's not a film about a man's struggle with potential paralysis, but when the rest of the feature plays so blandly and predictably, perhaps it should've been."
"This '70s-period sports comedy is only funny about half of the time and seems like an uneasy film hybrid. Half the time it's trying to be a Will Ferrell vehicle, and half the time it's trying to rip off of earlier, better movies."
"Even Newman can't completely salvage this misfire, which lacks the laughs and thrills necessary for such a risky movie hybrid."
Good performances almost make it worthwhile.
The director seems to take greater delight in laboriously killing off his characters than he does in delivering jokes.
"It doesn't take a great code-breaker to decipher the fact that for all the elaborate theorizing and running about in it, this movie is awfully empty-headed and flat-footed."
&#8220;Men&#8221; is a surreal-ish folk horror film that can best be described as an admirable mess&#46;
Little more than a sitcom premise stretched to feature length.
Where in blue hell is the Phantom of the Paradise when you need him?
"The scattered chuckles, while generally crude and obnoxious, might have more resonance if the film had some grounding in authenticity."
"This is the most disappointing film of the year, considering its pedigree -- a Mike Nichols film from a Nora Ephron script, starring Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson."
"Depending on your gender, age and Twihard-ness, this good-looking angst party is either a solid Meyer adaptation with quiver-worthy moments of hotness; or a wet, ludicrous, unintentionally-funny pile of steaming bathos."
its hackneyed dialogue and ridiculous bluster rank it a little lower than any of a handful of old gladiator movies made for a fraction of the price.
"Director Bill Pohlad's schizophrenic biopic of the Beach Boys' troubled genius, Brian Wilson, is two movies in one. Unfortunately, only one of them works."
The Last Thing He Wanted seems so taken with its own intricacy that it manages only to trip itself up.
The story's a bit overdramatic.
Blah Britpic offers scenery but little else.
The film falls apart in its numerous implausibilities.
The lamest blockbuster in some time.
"Post Grad is a collection of unfunny, insipid and predictable vignettes in search of a movie."
"The entire cast, especially Monáe who's a remarkable talent, deserve better than a half baked social commentary that chooses style over substance."
"If not for the likable Hill and the very believable Brand, the film would be a total bust."
"It's always presumptuous to suggest that a filmmaker doesn't realize where her narrative's attention should be directed, yet it's hard not to wonder if writer/director Anna Muyleart picked the right protagonist."
"The film relies too much on sci fi clichés and the plot holes become difficult to ignore. While the acting is good, the characterisation is lazy and dull. Moreover, the production design is wanting."
"Justified paranoia and dark digital photography combine forces in Open Water in an attempt to generate real fear in the audience, but the resulting film is simply too thin to manage the feat."
The only consistent element is noting that Robert Downey Jr is officially powerful enough as a top-billed star that once he decided to start doing this particular 'funny' accent as Dolittle... nobody was able to stop him.
"As a pop-culture reference fest, Seed Of Chucky stands as funnier than the second Scary Movie and less so than the third. As a horror film, of course, it doesn't register at all."
"[Singleton's] sloppiest, laziest movie to date, springing to life in fits and starts, risibly mawkish and occasionally gripping, and often feeling like it was made up on the set."
"A tricky, empty film adaptation of Michael Lesy's overrated 1973 book of the same name."
"It's good that [documentarian Alex] Gibney doesn't turn [Lance] Armstrong into a martyr, but that's mostly because he doesn't have anything to say."
A more personal approach would have elevated Patriots Day from a solid effort to retell a familiar story to a deep and moving reminder of the kind of personal damage that comes with this kind of tragedy.
"Lacks the conviction to deliver a true message to [teens], and winds up saying nothing."
"A close-up of two disparate families in current-day London, Breaking and Entering lacks the heart and emotional warmth needed to tell the story of betrayal and its effects on loved ones."
"Antonioni's dreamy, pretentious fickle-finger-of-fate mini-tales struggle to wrestle with love and desire, but truck in adolescent ideas and delight in nothing so much as undressing their many young actresses."
A relentlessly formulaic look at the downside of sexual obsession.
The problem is that it's muddled by taking on too much... It's fragmented and meandering. 
Too bloated with its own significance to deliver the requisite thrills.
"with characters this underdeveloped, all the explosions in the world wouldn't be enough"
"At its core, Big Game is really for 10-16 year old boys who are stuck inside their house over summer vacation watching TV. Its earnest silliness almost works, but the awful CGI and Jackson's scenery chewing never jell."
Is a movie beginning with a two-minute recap of previous installments not more like the start of a TV show's latest season? Should we call it True Blood Wars instead?
"Dory has a spark that never catches fire, leaving the bulk of its personality up to Driver and her interesting take on the often strange moods of this coming-of-age musical drama."
Weary and familiar foray in to gangster turf
The movie isn't some wicked subversion suggesting that the world is so corrupt that the bad guys are really the good guys. Rather it's a movie that can't figure out what might constitute a good or a bad guy in the first place.
Clooney the star schmoozes through on a gallon of charm and a pint of invention. He has said he might give up acting for directing. I think he already has.
Maybe it's a tall order for any conventional documentary to get its arms around a man whose 30-minute-plus jams routinely broke free of their moorings.
"Let me, a UW alumnus, assure you that no one would have Husky purple and Cougar crimson in the same closet. The fact that Nick wears both shows how top-to-bottom brainless this movie is."
As lifeless as a flat wine.
"A few scenes hint at the potential of the piece, while the rest of the effort seems more interested in curling up for a nap."
"X-Men: Apocalypse comes from the 'more is more' school of thought, and though it's [Singer's] biggest X-Men film to date, it's also his most disappointing."
"You can guess how it all ends, but getting there is a repetitious parade of put-downs and smackdowns that suggest you can't go home again."
"John Abraham is strictly one-note, which may be how dour cops are meant to come off, but it becomes same-same in a screenplay stretched to show off a well-muscled chest."
Simply having a trio of put-upon geeks at the centre of the movie doesn't offset the retrograde nature of the material.
"It's not a good movie, but, paradoxically, it's a perfect indication of Schrader's genius. [Full review in Portuguese.]"
"For someone who shared his vast imagination with the world, Tolkien the man deserves so much more artistry and originality than Tolkien the film can even begin to envision."
"This teen comedy with a ""be yourself"" message is slickly artificial, grinding painfully through extremely well-worn plot mechanics and essentially failing to follow its own message."
[Cage] acquits himself well enough in this otherwise rudimentary thriller from deliriously unsubtle director Roger Donaldson.
"What happens when smart people set out to make a dumb movie. They made the movie they wanted to watch, rather than the one anyone else might want to."
"The characters are sketchily drawn, so the success of this film depends almost entirely on the storytelling, which is exceptionally cluttered"
This Crank sequel fails to live up to the original in every way and that one didn't exactly set a high bar to begin with.
"This is a trifle too sweet to dip as dark as despair -- at worst, we know Anne will learn self-reliance."
"Cody has concocted a modern-day ""Alice Through the Looking Glass,"" with none of the danger or wit."
"After the Sunset is about as flat-footed a heist caper as I've ever seen: clumsy where it should be graceful, lumpy where it should be sleek."
"A stronger actress, say Michelle Pfeiffer or Cate Blanchette, would have given this political melodrama more credibility and power, but Andie MacDowell is poorly cast and she seems lost."
"It's just unfortunate that the muscular legacy of Cruella should, for now, end like this. Without a hint of cruelty at all."
While it&#8217;s fun to see Dame Helen Mirren play a literal god and Levi remains a highlight in the often too serious DCEU&#44; Shazam&#33; Fury of the Gods doesn&#8217;t retain the charm of its predecessor&#46;
"While admirable in its ambition, the end result just doesn't quite gel. Cool poster, though."
"Overall, though the message is solid, it is too convoluted and graphic, and even more unfortunately, the music is uninspired and the animation is generic."
The Algerian entrant for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar lacks the punch and imagination of its competition.
"Actually, not as bad as the reviews say; still ""solidly average"" does not a red tomato buy."
... makes no secret of its intentions as a crowd-pleaser for an older demographic in which originality is secondary to allowing its stars to share plenty of time in the spotlight.
"State of Play is the latest incoherently written, mass-entertainment gibberish by the overrated Tony Gilroy."
"Simon Kinberg's script feels phoned in, while Doug Liman's direction, adept with the massive explosions which dot the film, utterly fails at generating any romantic magic."
"Michael Bay has promised that this is the last Transformers movie he will direct, which is no small relief. It will not, alas, be the last Transformers movie."
"Bobby coasts along on a dread, and sorrow, it doesn't earn."
"Don't look now, but as you might expect with message-mad Kramer at the helm of this adaptation of Katherine Anne Porter's novel, there's a heavy allegory aboard."
... it's little more than a disjointed succession of kick-ass action scenes motivated by a country bumpkin's quest to rescue his giant pets from big-city baddies.
"Trying isn't doing, however, and Melancholia is ultimately beset by the same nagging problems that plague all of von Trier's more subdued works."
I never warmed up to it and felt cold about its lack of a story.
Writer&#47;director Nathaniel Marello-White doesn&#8217;t do nearly enough for his lead character&#44; Neve &#40;Madekwe&#41;&#44; as far as examining the situation she&#8217;s put herself in&#46;
I just didn't think it was funny and I didn't think that it was engaging as a sports movie.
a gay-themed Fatal Attraction in which homosexuality and deranged lunacy are treated as identical sides of the same coin.
"Harryhausen's many-armed gargantuan (for budgetary reasons, it actually only possessed six appendages) is easily the best reason to watch this production."
"Inflammatory talk-show host Morton Downey Jr. sparked, delighted, and quickly faded like a firecracker--not unlike the erratic, quick-fire presentation of his persona in the doc."
"In the Shadow of the Moon is inconsistently fascinating, often muddled, and totally ignorant of why time travel rules."
"Parodies are theoretically supposed to be funny... it’s almost as if there was an explicit directive not to crack any jokes, let alone exhibit any pleasure, in a film that deliberately skirts copyright infringement to bring a sadistic Grinch to theaters."
"I was looking forward to seeing a good popcorn movie and after it was over all I could say was, 'Next'."
So we've got a prodigal son who has the chance to deal with his father issues and discover things about his heretofore evil boss. It's like a romantic-comedy cliché twofer.
You'll never look at a pool cue the same way again.
"Lassie, come home!"
It's a wonder if Netflix is beginning to regret the bizarre 4-picture exclusive deal they agreed to with Sandler after this atrocious first effort.
"When it comes time to explain things, Ghost Ship founders hopelessly and runs aground on irrational thinking and rampant implausibility."
"The human dramas are less involving [than the dogs'], and a pair of teen romances feel like something on the Disney Channel."
"It's a well-meaning film, marked by Luke Ford's sensitive portrayal of a disabled character. But the main character is bland, imparting the same vibe on the rest of the film."
Much of the inherent sociopolitical subtext is overwhelmed by surface quirks and structural manipulations.
"It devolves into a mess of worn plot lines. If Morel wanted to give Penn's career new life as a world-weary action hero, he missed his target."
"In The Commuter, Neeson, like his character, is simply punching the clock."
It&apos;s not filmmaking&#46; It&apos;s efficient amusement-park automation with a proxy sense of guidance by indifferent&#44; inept summer help&#46; It also actively pits you against your fondest memories of the original film only for you to lose by a decisive knockout blow&#46;
"Greek mythology's famous strongman ironically fails to bust out of director Renny Harlin's weak-kneed and corroded costume drama...If anything, this particular Hercules stronghold barely musters up the interest to flash a bite-size bicep."
"Kurtzman has a style that could generously be described as ""accommodating."" In lieu of any strong vision of his own, he seems content to assemble The Mummy out of a hodgepodge of commercial ideas."
[W]on't make any sense to the uninitiated -- beyond the obvious nonsensical sense of frenetic action and weird aliens and laser guns going zap and such...
"After a first hour that plays like a bad TV show, Sommers hits his groove with an over-the-top Paris chase sequence that, in turn, leads to an underwater finale that's absurdly overproduced, momentarily diverting, and then instantly forgettable."
Opens with a self-referential song that comments on the fact that sequels are never quite as good as the film that inspired them and then goes on to prove the point.
"leaves out vital pieces of information, such as how and why the school was founded and who pays for it"
"Some moments turn out unintentionally laughable, and it all ends in a totally convenient and clumsy reveal that we anyhow saw coming."
The story has an undeniable tinge of soap opera that Minghella tries to rinse away by engaging in scenes crammed with self-analyzing dialogue and one emotional crisis after another.
Refn's urge to shock drives him to push things too far.
"Barely a notch above ""The Howling"" movie series"
"The dialogue is witless, the heroine is dull and, worst of all, the fights scenes are unconvincing."
Pretty much the entire film is played for laughs here.
"I Trapped the Devil is an ambitious idea, but beyond the premise it doesn't deliver on what it promises."
The story feels watered down and less powerful.
"What we mostly get served is lazy writing, lazy storytelling and an obscene waste of money -- all to show us what a mess the world is in. We don't need a ticket to see that."
"In trying to reach every audience, they capture none. There is eye candy for the kids, but it makes very little sense, there is no sweetness and the moments meant for adults were just plain odd."
It provides some campy high-brow titillation yet misses an opportunity at a more sincere or insightful probe of spiritual boundaries and sexual freedom.
Either the most inept vanity production ever made or the most deadpan satirical prank ever pulled.
The Paranormal Activity series hits the wall hard with this ineffectual and frequently interminable entry...
"The plot is pretty dumb, the monsters disconnected, and the victims forgettable."
"There's certainly an audience for this film, but not a big one."
"Director Ava DuVernay's version of the beloved children's classic has a big cast and the best of intentions. It's socially progressive, racially diverse and packed with positive messages. It's just not much fun."
"A road movie of sorts, it steers clear of melodrama or sentimentality, but it also never risks hitting anything."
"The problem with ""Pawn Shop Chronicles"" is not the fact that it is a clone of ""Pulp Fiction."" The problem is that it is a lousy clone."
"Payne's movie is flat, depressed, and at times -- given this director's talent -- disappointingly curdled."
Characters behave in a manner that often doesn't make sense. It's like watching a bad horror movie where the victims act as if they want to get caught.
The ham-fisted approach undercuts the valuable information that makes up Fail State.
"In this Che Guevara t-shirt of a film, the same cliche 'them and us' shadow play that MTV and VH1 stage in everything they produce about the American 1960s is extended so excruciatingly that the era seems to occur year by year in real time."
"Yes, there's a story of sorts - rival kingdoms, a young man's quest for revenge, a study in brotherly guilt and a doomed father-son relationship. Now I'm making it sound like Hamlet. Enough is enough."
'90s Schwarzenegger action movie is extremely violent.
"Hathaway has the unfortunate task of delivering a monologue that's straight out of Saturday Night Live's sendup of the reoccurring character Angel, the perpetually aggrieved girlfriend played by Heidi Gardner. The sentiment is virtually the same."
"Shallow, noisy and pretentious."
Ms. Headland has a concept for a latter-day screwball comedy ... but she doesn't have the jokes or the emotionally textured characters that can fill in that conceit.
Everyone's to blame here.
"If I was a kid, I'd want to hang out at Daddy Day Care and I'd probably recommend this movie, but my potty training days are behind me so I'm not quite there."
"Transferring from theatre, director Thea Sharrock ramps up the property porn, while failing to fill this space with anything like recognisable human activity or emotion."
"Unfortunately, it's also let down by a lacking script and somewhat nonsensical plot. But then again, if you're here to see Godzilla clashing with some classic monsters, that probably won't hinder your enjoyment of the at-times spectacular visuals."
"Yet another attempt to mix raunchy excess and romantic-comedy sweetness in an anything-goes raucous farce, The Babymakers offers a few big laughs between ho-hum stretches of frenetic vamping."
"""Generation Wealth"" feels like it's all over the place, and that, if most of its subjects are lacking in depth, the movie itself is open to the same criticism."
"In terms of taut plot, Derailed doesn't exactly hold together either, but it's good at pretending it does."
Get a room...far away form here.
A jarring amalgam of sitcom goofiness and uncomfortable ooginess.
[The] characters don't mean anything because they don't say anything or do anything that feels rooted in the nitty-gritty of the everyday.
"Ensemble comedy about an FBI agent who poses as a producer to catch the mob is occasionally funny, but not great."
"Thick with director Sam Raimi's gonzo flourishes, but thin on character."

Smells of something a few steps down from Aqua Velva.
"Had Paramount played more team ball, they coulda been a contender"
Feels like one of those mediocre and ultimately forgettable flicks from yesteryear.
It skims Alma's life like a thrown rock skipping over a pond.
"With its thin characters and derivative plot, the finished product seems more like a marketing concept than an actual film."
"It's an astonishingly crass and vulgar film, crudely directed on a cut-rate budget by Brian Robbins, never more than almost funny or less than disturbing."
This forgettable action-thriller features decent combat scenes but threadbare storytelling.
"...a hard film to criticise, as it is largely an enjoyable and pleasant film - but nothing more. In the end, however, compared to Payne's previous work that is perhaps the most damning criticism that could be leveled at it."
"The new Amityville is the same old circus of cheap shock scares, rambunctious editing, and lukewarm logic."
"Neighbors from hell, quite possibly literally and otherwise. Not to mention Spain's longstanding issues with an intermittently violent government itself into extermination, along with an intrusive and oppressive Catholic Church on the premises."
"Eager to please but ultimately unable to do so..While it will undoubtedly produce the waterworks, the laughs are a little harder to come by."
its primary effect is to leave you less thrilled than simply asking what's the point in remaking something if you can't improve on the original?
"Uses the old show merely as a springboard for a fairly conventional comedy-action movie that's louder, more frenetic and, ultimately, dumber."
A pseudo reality horror pic in need of an exorcist.
There's not much here for those with ages (or probably IQs) in the double digits.
"There is not one real, natural, or genuine second in this movie. It's a standard, stock romance that felt more like the filmmakers were completing a checklist of ""romantic drama"" story cliches, than telling an actual story"
Miller assembled a top-flight cast for his film: Alan Rickman plays Spurrier; Bill Pullman is Jim Barrett; and Dennis Farina portrays a flashy American wine buff named Maurice. These fine actors are shockingly misdirected.
"I'll take Disney's superior animated entertainment, Tarzan, over this any day of the week."
The film heaps on events and obstacles far too liberally for its skimpy frame.
A really really ridiculously stupid movie.
"Unimaginative and far from scary, don't believe anyone who tells you 'Mama' is worth your money or time."
"You know what sucks the most about Gold? Greatness is within its grasp, but in spite of its efforts, talent, and resources, the film just doesn't dig deep enough."
Those with no investment in MMPR lore will find it tough going throughout.
"Urgh. Another slice of over-designed pseudo-gothic crud from the criminally over-rated Guillermo del Toro, who has dutifully followed up his Transformers knock-off Pacific Rim with a bloated, empty-headed haunted house jaunt."
Ice Age 3 has the pacing of a glacier and the warmth of one too. That's something an extra dimension just can't overcome.
"If you are the world's biggest fan of movies that bake adultery, family, self-esteem, and your true life's purpose into a cake frosted with d**k jokes, this is your film."
"The laws of physics don't apply within the Matrix, but the law of diminishing returns does."
"To quote the touching words of one correspondent, posted during an online discussion of this movie, 'I didn't like the story.' Not much to be done about that."
"This team effort feels less joyous, more uninspired."
"What, a white woman can't take an innocent drive through the ghetto without arousing suspicion? What's this world coming to?"
"An innocuous romantic comedy about missed connections, like Serendipity for people who can't vote yet."
"The problem with the film is that, although it is well performed and competently directed, the blandness of the result renders it easy to watch but hard to be enthusiastic about."
"No Time To Die is a misguided, meandering slog. [Daniel Craig] deserved a far better franchise send-off than this."
&#8216;Avatar&#8217; with Ants&#8230;and some jokes&#46;
"The only thing that could improve Never Die Alone is a caring projectionist, a lighter, and a trashcan."
A film that has an enormous narrative clumsiness that distances the viewer at all times. [Full review in Spanish]
"They have tried to balance tragedy and slapstick. Whether it succeeds or not is a matter of personal taste. For me, it doesn’t."
"has good intentions and a golden heart, but that doesn't take you that far"
"On balance, Singleton's second film shows he's capable of doing more or less anything he sets his mind to. But, not unlike Lucky and Justice, he needs to narrow his focus and decide exactly what that is."
...essentially Seabiscuit minus the cheering crowds
I prefer my Ant-Man movies smaller than whatever this was
That a filmmaker as promising as Fuqua squandered time and talent on Tears of the Sun is nothing short of a crying shame.
Mildly auspicious if ultimately disappointing.
Twisted's tale could have done with a little bit of Joe Eszterhas flamboyance.
"The movie's poster advertises ""a castle can only have one king"". That may be true, but how come this ""Last Castle"" has so many jesters?"
"It seems to have been made for 15-year-old boys by a sad middle-aged man whose only experience of life is from violent comics, shoot-'em-up video games and online pornography."
There's nothing novel about this overly familiar farce.
Reality Bites begins as a promising and eccentric tale of contemporary youth but evolves into a banal love story as predictable as any lush Hollywood affair.
A comedy so dark you have to turn the house lights on to see the screen.
"Ellis' book, though a grim read, had a satirical edge to it that made it darkly enjoyable; the movie is simply dark and dull. And vampireless, more's the pity."
"It all comes off like a bad episode of The King of Queens, just moved to a different borough."
"Rory O'Shea is half sitcom, half sap."
"Unlike the titular meal, there's not much substance to the nostalgic screenplay, even if the ensemble cast brings a heartfelt charm to the predictable material."
"""I think their marriage was a mystery to everyone,"" an Eames worker notes-an observation true of every couple that you'll wish the filmmakers had explored more deeply."
Playing With Fire is relatively inoffensive&#44; but this four-men-and-three-babies spin borders on tedious&#46;
The Interview in a nutshell: Half-baked and ultimately forgettable.
"The humans are wooden, the computer-animals have that floating, jerky gait of animated fauna."
"Unable to capture either its wit, psychological acuity, or formal rigor, the movie essentially reduces the schematic, seesaw narrative to doomy clichs."
"As Ain't Them Bodies Saints moves along, its elliptical approach to drama goes from keeping us on our toes to dulling everything down."
"It's an extraordinary story but sadly the film is not. Plodding and mechanical instead of involving and moving, the film fails to sweep us away on what should be a hugely emotional journey"
"There's a far more subversive political mock-umentary coming next week. I invite President Bush, Senator Clinton, and all politicians to get down with Borat."
The latest installment of the Twilight franchise's teeny-bopper-vampire-werewolf-melodrama comes the closest so far to presenting an entertaining cinematic experience but still not close enough for uninitiated audiences.
Embarrassments abound. Choosing the rock-bottom of the film's excruciatingly unfunny scenes makes for a tough choice.

The Judge gives the sense of resting on its casting laurels.
"Terry George would have been wise to focus his attention on Bale's journalist, allowing his dogged account of the sad history of Armenia to raise our ire and serve as a rallying cry for exposing this long-hidden international injustice."
"There is certainly much to celebrate and remember about the former U.S. president's tenure, but Souza, and Porter, don't seem much interested in anything approaching nuance."
"The writers take the story precisely where we've come to expect. That said, we've certainly seen worse this year."
"The film's lack of scale becomes readily apparent in the final confrontation, which is surprisingly toothless."
It duplicates Thomas' miserable world so well we want to escape it as urgently as Thomas does.
"The movie's action unfolds laboriously before us, dragged along, bumpety-bumpety, by the plodding voiceover that Leguizamo has the misfortune of delivering."
"Plummer and Janet McTeer, as the Kaiser's wife, bring their customary class to proceedings. But they can't save a tepid mishmash that seems undecided whether it's wartime romance, spy drama or fanciful political fable."
"The most promising idea, a rigid adherence to experiencing something through the eyes and ears of a speechless autistic boy, is fudged...And the ending is a cop-out."
There may have been a good movie somewhere in Runner Runner but it's not even in sight as it stands nows.
"Ominously undercooked and unbalanced, this epicurean feast culminates in an infuriatingly enigmatic conclusion."
"Even before Brendan Fraser is blasted in the puss with skunk spray, 'Furry Vengeance' stinks"
"Both performers are treasures; both deserve, together and separately, a better showcase than this."
"While the movie's a letdown in the remake and modernization departments, it's at least a modest success in terms of ebullient talent and frothy farce."
"There are allusions to William Golding's Lord of the Flies, but that fine novel, and Peter Brook's 1962 screen adaptation, though also elliptical, provided far more satisfying drama than Landes somewhat frustrating epic..."
"Mind-numbing, formulaic twaddle."
Whatever steam Culkin gained in Home Alone was lost in this tepid sequel rehash.
"Too bad we didn't have Bill Paxton's Hudson to relentlessly shout out 'Game over, man. Game over!'"
"[The filmmakers] succeed in eliminating the mystique and horror of the eponymous figure in multiple, oftentimes laughable ways."
"The film is bland and predictable, underestimates kids' abilities to understand story and humor, and relies way too much on sight gags that are clichéd and overdone."
"Bad, but unlike the similarly camped-up Little Buddha or Stealing Beauty, it's not exactly boring."
"Moreover, the production lacks the personal touch that might allow this story to resonate as parable - it's too conventionally classy and Miramaxed, with its swooping, prestige-picture camerawork and lachrymose score by the dread James Horner."
"You keep looking for a sign that its young writer-director, Ryan Schifrin, is going for a tongue-in-cheek romp. But no, he seems to be deadly earnest."
Gets bogged down by predictable supporting characters and some tasteless humor.
Catastrophic
"The degeneration of the ""Star Wars"" saga continues unabated with this latest, most kid-friendly Lucas-produced assault on the memory of the once-beloved franchise."
Where are we going with this? There's almost nothing left to learn about Devereaux in the last hour that we haven't in the first.
The final act is a groan-inducing slap to the face that had me wanting to throw popcorn at the screen in indignation.
"Cop Out wouldn't be as disappointing if it hadn't been made by Smith, but for those who dig the vulgar wit of his early, funny films, it's not just stupid, it's sad."
"The early scenes are interesting and enjoyable. And then the novelty wears off, but the film doesn't end."
"If the road to hell really is paved with good intentions, cliches and stock characters are the asphalt."
"It also doesn't help that the machines, for all their malevolent (and somewhat brilliant) twisting of events, are extremely stupid when the chips start falling their way."
The writing/producing team behind 2007 Brit farce Death At A Funeral transplants most of the same plot points but none of the laughs...
"Patrick Hughes's movie is still throwaway tosh, but if I come across it on television one day, I might watch for a while."
This overstuffed and shallow film does not come close to meeting any epic aspirations.
An anaemic adaptation that simply goes through the motions&#44; hitting all the expected notes in formal succession&#44; with the assistance of upbeat eruptions of pop music&#46;
"The result is a cinematic illustration of the law of diminishing returns, in which more money, more exotic locales, more crazy situations and more Mike Tyson all fuel a familiar carnival of abasement."
It appears Myers did not have someone behind the camera reigning him in. Too bad.
"The first computer-animated film from Disney also has the distinction of being a terrible movie a hectic, uninspired pastiche of catch phrases and cliches."
"Viewers who are coming to it cold will, most likely, leave feeling enervated, confused, and queasy."
"There is never any doubting Doillon's sincerity or artistry but his film is overly cerebral, unfolding in a series of encounters that fade to black and never build a dramatic momentum."
"Sudeikis' smooth charisma and Brie's wide-eyed charm almost carry the film, but while Headland bravely chooses to skip certain expected rom-com beats, she also fails to earn certain rom-com payoffs."
"Feels in some ways like a '90s thriller  la The Hand that Rocks the Cradle or Arlington Road, but it lacks either of those films' thrills."
"Diana pays for her bad choices perpetually, in large part through her self-comparisons to M, whose piety she alternately teases and reveres."
"Its failure to appropriately skewer the corporate retreat and all its phony ideas of family and organizational harmony, is just a huge missed opportunity."
Hide and Suck
"The arguably overexposed Amanda Seyfried (if you've seen ""Chloe"" you know I'm not exaggerating) is charming in the otherwise belabored and contrived ""Letters to Juliet."""
"Although the acting is pleasant enough, the script by the director suffers from a paucity of ideas. His characters are handsomely outlined but never adequately filled in."
Doppelgangers have always been a staple between the competing comic companies but in this slapped-together entry&#44; the DCU has officially transformed &#40;or transmorphed&#41; into The Asylum video boxes designed to trick viewers they are watching the real thing&#46;
a tepid update of the screwball comedy formula with vaguely satiric overtones
...a well-intentioned yet utterly misguided underwater thriller.
One of those metaphoric weird-out flicks that takes mors pride in shocking than telling an interesting tale.
"The most basic problem with Smith's film is that it simply is not funny. The closest it gets is a handful of minor chuckles mixed amongst a much louder, more plentiful set of groans."
Doesn't have the originality of the first film and feels a little boring as such.
"It ain't bad, though all that detritus detracts from a far more interesting history lesson on repression and rebellion that's left on the periphery."
The ambiguity Mr. Naranjo has stripped away from Ms. Ziga's cautionary tale is hardly made up for on the back end.
"Travolta is aiming for Hallmark-style heartwarming sentiment, but the production values make Hallmark movies look like the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"[Diane Kruger] has an instinct for subtlety that isn't always mirrored in her director, whose appetite for melodrama or contrivance can be destabilising... You don't cast someone as deft as Kruger and then augment her work with gimmicks."
"The movie is flat, logy, and amateurish -- a Scotch - tape- and - balsa - wood job."
No doubt Harrison Ford's Han Solo would casually dismiss this adequately fun origin story with a wink and a wry smile.
"Your attention never flags, mainly because the filmmakers are so determined to hold it, whether through the thunderous sound, in-your-face imagery or surfeit of (literal) potty humor."
"The filmmakers of Held must think that viewers are as simple-minded as this movie's mystery plot. The acting is often stiff, the pacing is frequently lackluster, and it's not that hard to figure out who's behind the terror that's being inflicted."
"A surprisingly unfunny, belabored and unimaginative comedy, Bee Movie is a huge disappointment considering the extent of Seinfeld's participation."
"Whannell doesn't reprocess or reboot clichés; he depends on them and peddles them. As a director, he photographs his plot points and sees no moments between moments, conveys no sense of experiential continuity."
"Too bad the film, about a budding journalist assigned to do an expose on the degradations of high school life, simply isn't worthy of [Barrymore]."
"Not that it matters but it was horrible. Zsa Zsa Gabor wigs, 99%u023C Store makeup, and overall lousy filmmaking. Disney vampires without teeth or lust %u2013 is this really what pre-teens want?"
"There are ticklish moments, but no real laughs."
"""Legend"" could serve as a kind of greatest-hits collection for the best actor working today. Unfortunately, it's also supposed to serve as a movie proper, and that's where it falls short."
"While there are fantastic stretches of thought-provoking dialogue, too often, the writers feel it necessary to pander to their audience."
"""The Croods"" rests on the notion of the patriarch who must learn to adapt and let go. (I resent this storyline, for the record.)"
"Why was the sight of scrawny Woody Allen kissing pretty Diane Keaton never revolting, while scrawny David Spade kissing beautiful Sophie Marceau in Lost & Found is the creepiest cinematic sight of the year?"
"What should be a breezy, hand-waving romp turns out to be a misshapen, lazy flop. One moment it soothes the heart with sweet music, and the next it fries your ears with feedback."
Frankenheimer rams the plot through turnstiles of gibberish!
"John Michael McDonagh fails to get anywhere near the heights of his hilarious debut The Guard, in this less-than-palatable buddy-cop movie."
"Shorn of Nabokov's language, as it must be, any film of Lolita, even one as adequately made as Lyne's, must seem somewhat gaunt."
"It's a massively difficult line to straddle for a first-time director, and Wright misses the mark despite her best efforts."

"As crude as you'd expect, and not as funny as you'd hope"
"While it may not actually be worth the effort to go to the theater, it may very well be worth the effort to get it on pay per view or regular cable later in the year."
"Whatever you want W. to be, you'll almost certainly be disappointed."
"Jane becomes less and less real, just one more piece of moving scenery."
"There's undoubtedly more nudity than in a standard 21st Century Hollywood movie, but it's less explicit and less passionate than what Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone got up to in Basic Instinct more than 20 years ago."
"In attempting to grapple with issues of bullying, mental health, burgeoning sexuality, and pedophilia, the film bites off more than it can chew."
This is one of those movies whose script and one-liners have somehow fallen through the cracks in the directorial tussle for style over substance.
"Basically, it looks a 105-minute ad for perfume: Pervitude, by Chanel."
"""Mother's Day"" is a total mess, but what's truly offensive is that they didn't even try to make this cynical, post-Sunday brunch cash grab even remotely watchable. Your mom deserves so much better this Mother's Day."
"Even with an epic running time of close to two-and-a-half hours, All Eyez On Me never gets to the heart of a man described as a ""walking contradiction""."
Everything is off.
"If you love the paintings of Auguste Renoir or the films of his son Jean, there's a good chance you'll sit through this slow-moving prestige item."
Dire.
A movie with this much action and slaughter shouldn't be this boring.
The film's grungy setting promises more suspense and thrills than actually materialize on screen.
"In a scene where Romney explains that within five years the country could fall into utter fiscal chaos, he exudes no more passion than in another scene where he picks up stray trash from a balcony."
It should provide its target Gen Z skate-boarding audience with a visually great looking coming-of-age film.
Brutally violent horror remake is a huge waste.
"'The Change-Up' begins with a scene in which a baby projectile-poops into the eyes and mouth of its father. All I have to say is: Genius, and this is just the beginning."
...a surefire reassurance that war is indeed hell...another prime example of ingenuity involving a box of crayons and someone's desperate idea for quick-witted lunacy.
"Director Patrick Brice attempts to drag the movie's throwback genre into the present with a mix of old-school thrills, modern cultural norms and a killer who takes the term cancel culture a bit too seriously, but never quite gets there."
[From the Land of the Moon] makes for a rather tedious exploration of a rebellious and repressed spirit.
"A waste of time, really, but Josh Brolin's inexplicable cameo as a lingerie-wearing thug has to be seen to be believed."
The attempt to marry naturalistic filmmaking to opera -- much of the narrative unrolls in song -- is misguided and unconvincing.
"Its message ... never lands, because the movie itself is apathetic to the one character who matters the most."
There is no excuse
Let's just be sure that from now on we let poor Edgar rest in peace until we have a really good reason to disturb him.
"Apart from reviving the original Massacre's pervasive sense of Nixon-era malaise, it doesn't offer much in the way of satisfying origins."
"Though it is reasonably effective as a morality tale on the dangers of spreading a rumor, it is even more pertinent to the perils of burying a worthy screenplay under layers of big-budget gloss."
Will they succeed? It doesn't matter. Nothing matters.
"Anchorman 2 is louder, sillier and vastly more absurd than its now cult predecessor, but it's also longer, so when those less successful sequences miss the mark it feels like there are yawning chasms between laughs instead of beats."
does little more than ape some vague Quentin Tarantino/Guy Ritchie cinematic style
"Quite frankly, Dowse's transparent twitchy vehicle has all the cheeky charm of a roadblock during rush hour traffic. Needlessly frantic and foolish..."
"The gifted Crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself, and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him."
"Screenwriter James Cameron and director Robert Rodriquez's long-in-the-making adaptation of a popular manga feels wobbly, worked-over and way past its sell-by date. It looks ready to rock, but there's no life left in the party."
"Resisting making a movie about characters instead of sweeping generalizations on the wide world of illegal drugs, [Soderbergh] fails to come up with a point."
"While Stallone is back and game to dish out the pain, it's safe to say that Rambo's famous Bowie knife has officially dulled."
A doctor could play “80 for Brady” on a loop and spend all day performing colonoscopies.
"Dropsical with self-importance, and setting a bold new standard in joylessness..."
"The overheard conversations touch on social issues (e.g., China's rapid industrialization and rampant unemployment) addressed more thoroughly in numerous recent Chinese films."
Largely a waste of time and talent
Original only in the number of movies it cribs from&#46; But it isn&#8217;t &#8220;Stand By Me&#44;&#8221; it&#8217;s not really &#8220;Five Teens and a Baby&#44;&#8221; and it sure as shooting isn&#8217;t &#8220;Goonies&#46;&#8221;
"The Eagle can't sustain its scope. When it's small, it's kind of silly. When it's big, it's much, much better."
"God's Not Dead, despite excellent production values, leaves scant room for the imagination or mystery. It is a contrived, implausible Sunday school lesson...God, whom people seem to think needs defending, deserves better from the artistic community."
"This film is about a woman trying to move mountains to make herself happy, and the singular quest of every other character in the movie is to serve her in that quest."
"It makes me truly fearful of having to sit through 103 Dalmatians, which will be an inevitability after this one makes another $100 million."
Diesel is an imposing screen presence even when growling risible dialogue.
Sold as a groundbreaking convergence of Asia's leading cinematic influences -- kung fu flicks and Bollywood extravaganzas -- it can only be termed genre-mashup overkill.
(Will) blow out of town as quickly as it came.
"Like a bad case of déjà vu, The Hangover Part II is a cruder, much more morbid, and essentially less funny retread of the first film."
One of the most ludicrous movies in years&#46;
The Brink doesn't end up illuminating anything new about Bannon's style or persona. It just traps the viewer in small rooms with a man who has convinced himself he's larger than life. Hard pass.
"Although Gerard Butler's star has significantly fallen due to the 17 mediocre films he's made since 300, it must be admitted that he's missed here ..."
Yechi poodle poo.
Jolie does as well as she can with the twigs they've given her to make a plot house out of.
"With so many good versions of this story on film, it's a little difficult to recommend this telling"
"Not enough Gordan Gekko! 'Money Never Sleeps' is like watching two hours straight of CNBC, which is great if that is your channel of choice, but not a triumph for a feature-length film."
The comic intentions are obvious but barely warrant a smile.
A minor diversion dripping in splatter and groaning with self-amusement.
The Disappointments Room lives (and dies) up to its name.
A beautiful-looking but essentially lifeless work that would seem more at home on a mantelpiece than on a movie screen.
"We've been here before and it's been done better, much better."
"It's scary to think of how much better this king of the jungle could've been had it possessed the sharp teeth of its animal namesake and took a serious bite out of the plump themes of family greed, lost love and misspent youth."
"If anything, there's too much focus here on the games and not enough on the central romance and characters, which undercuts both."
"Often simplistic and sometimes clumsy, the movie never quite gets how convoluted Dalton Trumbo's convictions actually were."
An oddball&#44; off-kilter film that repeatedly skirts multiple genres without settling on one &#40;likewise&#44; tone&#41; &#46;&#46;&#46; ultimately devolves into a frustrating experience&#44; becoming more unfocused and meandering as it approaches the limits of its &#46;&#46;&#46; premise&#46; 
"Clumsy, inane and retrograde in all the wrong ways."
Our investment in the plight of Jay and Samira requires more than the promise of potential double crosses to latch onto such a flimsy narrative.
Por que deveramos nos interessar por estes ricaos fteis e seus ridculos problemas amorosos?
Without any depth to these characters&#44; Memory has little to offer audiences that they haven&#8217;t seen before&#46;
The supposed playful banter between Anakin and the feisty Ahsoka is particularly cringe-worthy.
Trash Humpers is Korine the performance artist pleading for attention. Look away.
The initial banter between the lads - some of which is actually quite endearing and funny - eventually gives way to cheesy scenes designed to titillate rather than tickle the funny bone.
On a Magical Night finally feels recitative of past lovelorn material - especially given the classic Paris setting - rather than fully alive.
"It's insulting to its source material, it's insulting to fans of that source material, and it's insulting to its audience's intelligence."
Dude&#44;Where&apos;s My Car&#63; isn&apos;t a good movie&#46; But it is at least possessed of a certain vapid honesty&#46;
"If you'd like a look at Paris in all its splendour, look no further than Angel-A. Just be sure that in order to see Paris in all its splendour you don't mind sitting through a silly little comedy with a dopey ending."
"Proficiently made, deeply offensive and undeniably cruel, like a popular restaurant serving fresh-roasted puppy."
"The helmer can't help herself with floppy camerawork and only-in-the-movies moments of flamboyant catharsis, but the picture is the least Hardwicke-ian of her troubling career, and that's a promising development."
"The more “Electrical Life” goes on, the more buried it becomes, sometimes literally, under a sea of quirk rather than delving into just how far Wain fell and how his vulnerability left him exploited."
The sequel's virtually a photocopy of the 2001 surprise hit.
"It's all well-intentioned, of course, and should get your blood boiling even if the film's ambition seems to exceed its oversimplified and sometimes overwrought narrative grasp."
Oy gevalt!What a disappoinment!
"Almost 20 years after Barfly, Factotum mostly feels... unnecessary."
"It's never as scary or suspenseful as it aspires to be, but it might just be the greatest bad movie of the year, with its clunky writing resulting in some surprisingly entertaining kooky moments."
"""Savages"" makes you wonder where Stone, that most pointed of directors, is going. And then it never gets there, backing off at the last minute. As such, it is literally a brutal disappointment."
"G. I. Joe: Retaliation could best be described as formulaic, in that it seems like it was made from a recipe. Take two parts Bruce Willis and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, and mix for 100 minutes"
The overripe morsel who gets batted around in the Japanese absurdithon The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai looks like she was conjured up by a teenage boy in dangerous hormonal overdrive.
If anyone goes looking for a cinematic education in the ways of Godard or New Wave here-or just wants to stoke their excitement about cinema in general-they will leave disappointed and likely a little pissed.
"Many lighthearted musicals have frilly plots, but the story cobbled together for Mamma Mia! is particularly superficial and imbecilic."
This clamorous offering fails to elicit either laughs or much in the way of sympathy.
Might have been a touching story of deep irony if Schrader's approach didn't suffer so much from narrative confusion in an effort to convey the disorientation at its center.
"The performances are pretty good, Cox especially, but all in all we don't really care all that much about the characters or what happens to them, and the ending, while unexpected is really lame."
"Don't Let Go has good lead performances, but the overall film is lacking. Multiple plot holes and a conspicuous antagonist defangs the murder mystery."
A creepy and self-indulgent dystopian fable.
"...altogether more coherent in its story, editing and spacial integrity, but it still has flaws aplenty, the most objectionable being directory Michael Bay's use of national tragedies like the Challenger explosion and 9/11 as grist for his mill."
"The critics and the media generally are terribly impressed with Cameron and Avatar because of the massive amounts of money involved, both in its production ... and now in its worldwide release."
"On the basis of the evidence here, it’s clear that [first-time director J.J.] Perry certainly knows how to shoot heavy-duty action. Unfortunately, there’s precious little sense or coherence to the storytelling."
"This hack job simply apes the conventions of dumb, homegrown crime dramas."
"Nancy's fashion faux pas and lack of coolness are nothing compared to the movie's plot gaps, unsuccessful jokes and old-fashioned continuity problems."
Pity that Wilson and Hathaway are so aggressively wasted.
"Despite Washington's best efforts, Roman J. Israel, Esq. feels like it was named after the wrong character."
Relies too heavily on toilet humor and lacks positive morals or teachings. [Full review in Spanish]
Paula Patton is too likable to take a pathetic role like this!
"This is one that we'll basically have to write off as a missed opportunity. It looks great and is mildly interesting at times, but in the end, there's just not much that's particularly memorable here."
"Narratively, thematically, this is a dismissible picture, just another in a long and forgettable line of silly action flicks."
"Is there anything scarier than a threatening text message? Sure: Werewolves, vampires, killer diseases, and comedies written by and starring Jenny McCarthy come immediately to mind."
The chief pleasures of this mild-mannered dud lie in watching two resourceful comic actors go through their paces like the pros they are.
"Not merely Pacino's over-mannered, near-histrionic performance, but the movie itself could be characterized as busy, busy, busy. It's so full of plot twists and revelations and exploding sports cars that its very perkiness comes to seem comic."
"Has no story, no ending and no redeeming value."
Stupid movie pushes boundaries of PG-13.
"Like a cheap, uninspired ITV bank holiday drama in which a decent cast is left stranded by a lousy script and lifeless direction."
"Any story that's been passed down through several generations is likely to have been embellished along the way, but this adaptation of a Japanese folk tale takes things a little too far."
"Nothing deeper than a stale retread, it seems. And this observation comes from a critic who listed the original Charlie's Angels movie as one of the top five films of 2000."
Kassovitz ... seems totally oblivious to how silly this all gets.
"The tone of the film is off-key from the beginning, a fact that's not helped by the presence of Speedman, onetime Felicity heartthrob."
"Unwilling or unable to tap into ... deeper emotions and concerns, the Russo brothers ... focus exclusively on the sprawling surface elements of their movie."
A confused downer of a finale to an otherwise exemplary run of big-budget Kaiju movies.
The ho-hum thrills and coincidental mystery of these Games will likely leave you shrugging with indifference on the way out the door.
"Despite a promising setting and characters, this drama quickly disappoints as it turns into an ordinary story of romantic teen angst, avoiding any kind of cultural exploration or understanding."
"Even the worst simulation would have more clarity than this. Life might be messy and weird and scary, but it possesses more honesty than this cinematic misery."
"The deepest frustration is that Barker had seemingly unrestricted access to one of the most revolutionary and skilled White House offices of the postwar era, yet the end result is like condensing an entire season of The West Wing."
Movies obsessed with keeping us guessing can miss out on providing reasons to keep us caring.
"If you're a fan of the original games, I can't blame you for a certain level of animosity toward this...it's fun enough I guess if you're watching at home, but again, that's me not playing the games."
"Nobody's going to get all that fired up about Fired Up, the latest in what seems like a million-mile-long line of purposely dumb adolescent sex comedies. But as genre entries go, this one's passable fun."
"With its melodramatic flourishes, simplistic black-and-white moralizing and general aura of studied manipulation, Won't Back Down is part of the problem rather than the solution."
"It's only a few weeks before Christmas, and do you know what that means?... it means horror movies about human organ trafficking."
"The filmmakers try to use special effects to cover up the weaknesses of the story, but even on that point they fail pretty badly."
There were more chills in a single frame of 'The Babadook' than in this entire dreary movie.
"Couldn't be any less like its title, as the mix of quirks, crime and comedy... comes off as labored and largely unfunny."
It's a hot mess.
Singer throws expensive-looking set piece after expensive-looking set piece at the screen and none of it sticks.
"Feels like stale, soupy leftovers."
"...by Pixar's outrageous standards of Oscar shoo-in virtuosity, this sequel is a disappointment at best."
"Less about a nerd's worship of his hero than the loneliness of being worshipped by nerds ... In Ready Player One, finding mastery and satisfaction in reiterating the past is inherently melancholy."
"An uneven collection of bodily function jokes, facial gyrations, sexual jibes and pedestrian slapstick."
It's when the movie widens from this core group of characters that it stumbles fatally.
"Ah, the nostalgic mob drama. No matter the brutality, the blood, or the sheer fear that shape the memory, movies and TV tend to make life in the mob a growth experience."
"Plotting stutters through incidents and walk-ons, and although the climax hits hard, the sketchy build-up clouds fresh insight. Boom strains to pack a lot in: in doing so, he stretches his key beats thin."
"""Enter the Void"" is banal, melodramatic, repetitive, monotonous and dull. As Oscar's junkie-artist guru, Cyril Roy is really very good. But we spend far too much time following the back of Oscar's head."
"Unless you're a die-hard Eddie Murphy fan, there's no reason for you to 'Meet Dave,' a substandard comedy that should have gone straight to DVD."
A joyless exercise in obligatory adaptation&#46; If this is Hollywood&apos;s idea of a live-action Pinocchio&#44; they all owe Roberto Benigni an apology&#46;
"Judge, unfortunately, is not judgmental enough to bail on the jokes that don't bear fruit %u2013 and not driven enough to really exploit the ones that do."
[A] disappointing romantic comedy that never shifts into high gear.
"Most everyone loves a ripping good sea yarn, so why doesn't Kon-Tiki rip?"
Is over-arching sincerity only results in a stiffness that gives way to B-movie melodramatics in time for the clich-ridden finale.
A jerry-rigged terror-on-a-plane thriller with a premise so far-fetched as to create a degree of suspense over how the writers will wriggle out of the knot of their own making.
It smoulders and smokes and generates some heat but it never really bursts into flame.
"There's an inherent lack of dramatic thrust here. If George can't even admit he's in love, I'm not going to wait around for him to figure it out."
It's a film without much resonance - there is no way of knowing what lasting effects the pupils' experiences will have on them - but it's smoothly made by Jordan Scott.
There&apos;s nothing &quot;wrong&quot; with this instinct to heal the hearts of &#40;and extract advertising dollars from&#41; a grieving nation&#44; but dramatic it ain&apos;t&#46;
"A cliche-ridden exercise that never exhibits any real heart and focuses on characters who never come alive, it also never comes close to living up to the promise of the names in the credits."
"Some dazzling acrobatic dance moves, but the story is pretty lame. The DVD, however, with quality extras, rates a B."
"Diaz and Segel are genuinely funny people, who had good chemistry in ""Bad Teacher."" That chemistry isn't the same here, with the actors saddled in a ridiculous plot that is never as clever as it thinks it is."
"I assume that Bjrk: Biophilia Live was more thrilling in concert than on film, or else half the audience would have been asleep."
Writer-director Edson Oda never really puts a unique spin on the familiar story of otherworldly figures peering in on the lives of the living.
"So little has been done to update or refresh ""The Intouchables"" for American culture or a new audience that ""The Upside"" has no integrity as a separate piece of work."
"The derivative Rio 2 is a riot of color with groovy music, but not a single original moment to its name."
It's a no-brainer that Disney would do a re-make and a no-brainer is what we got.
"The movie never establishes its own viewpoint. It remains a random collection of clips, many fascinating in their own right, that are never quite shaped into a larger picture or more cohesive theme."
Senseless holiday slasher film&#46;
Trevorrow ... throws everything together into a sugary concoction that's about as appetising as the peanut butter and breakfast cereal sandwiches Naomi Watts' character makes for her kids.
"It's nothing that will have the horror fan howling because it's a lot more bark, than bite."
A third of it is an episodically disordered string of scenes that coalesce into a narrative. The remaining two thirds is melodrama.
This clunker by director Zhang Yimou purports to be a remake of Blood Simple but looks more like a bad imitation of Terry Gilliam.
"It's clear Theron didn't so much resemble [Wuornos] as she did channel her deeply tormented soul, in a way that Broomfield never manages to do."
"Fuqua has delivered his satirical masterpiece, a film that exposes every cop-movie cliché in the book by deploying every cop-movie cliché in the book, all the while -- and this is the genius part -- pretending that no-one has ever done this stuff before."
The genre is ripe for mocking. But this steers clear of smart observational comedy and goes for gross-out every time.
"A plea for film preservation made in the medium that's killing it, Hugo unwittingly proves that old movies really were better."
"In any other movie, the filmmaker would rightly be accused of trafficking in lazy stereotypes, but lazy stereotypes are the beachhead into which Tyler Perry has firmly planted his flag."
"Christie’s cool flint is swapped out for tearful ruminations on lost love in Death on the Nile, an intermittently entertaining but otherwise tiresomely lugubrious trip down crocodile-filled waters."
"Are you a little girl, aged between six and ten?... Have you learnt every song from Frozen and are you ready to torment your parents with a whole new repertoire?... congratulations, you are part of the ridiculously specific target audience for [Annie]."
I thought the acting was quite good but... you saw everything and I felt like there was no mystery left in the film.
12 Hour Shift mistakes a lack of humanity for a comedic point of view.
"With cheapie effects and a barrage of monkey puns, Space Chimps is too often content with only going halfway."
"Enough already! Nun more, please. And ""cute"" is not the descriptive word here."
"With that cast, we rightfully expect fireworks. What we get is the film equivalent of a wet blanket."
"It's all so much turgid brooding, dialogue underlined with import, and leaden symbolism involving Rapace's white and red dresses, none of which is salvaged by a typically understated Farrell performance."
The storm blows fiercely but the love story doesn't match its power.
Too Adrift
Cinematic aerophagia
"It's too bad [the writers] didn't follow their slacker protagonists' example, and amble slowly through their cross-country road trip flick. Instead, they all labor overtime to mark every stop along the map, usually with neon signs and flashing arrows."
"A trite, arch, frantic, condescending, vaguely racist and homophobic little bonbon of computer generated noise. It's more like an assault than a movie."
"""Ferdinand"" goes on and on, and the further it gets away from the source material, the more tedious it becomes, delivering filler for family audiences, not kid lit enchantment."
"[The film] squeezes an impressive amount of information into a relatively brief running time, yet it's blandly straightforward in its use of talking heads and archival footage."
The storytelling&#44; characters&#44; and performances prove serviceable enough to keep our attention but never leave a lasting impression&#46; 
"A simmering but underwhelming thriller, its quiet, methodical contemplation of a simple thread is punctuated by admittedly punchy action sequences. The overall effect is not necessarily disorderly, but one that does not fulfil its full potential."
Polish Wedding fails to engage us!
Return to Paradise isn't a bad film. It's just one that doesn't live up to its potential.
"We've seen this movie about corrupt cops and the families they take down a thousand times before, but rarely has it been so bafflingly inept in its execution."
"... another genre head-scratcher from Lpez-Gallego, who last brought us 'Apollo 18' ... It won't impress the more literal-minded fans of 'World War Z' or 'The Crazies.'"
The film's few moments of hilarity are no less welcome for being completely unintended...
"At the heart of Goalie is a tragic tale worth telling, but unfortunately the film, despite its best intentions, fails to do it justice."
"It doesn't have a script that draws us in, or characters we care about. It's a mere jumble of special effects, hoping to catch kids searching for a quick summer substitute for Harry Potter."
"The screenplay has some thoughtful things to say on the meaning of, and desire for, idols, but it's mainly just lethargic."
"Streep goes for it like Elizabeth Taylor in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, but ratcheted up at least 467 times."
"For a movie directed by two Hong Kong legends, Tsui Hark and Ringo Lam, Twin Dragons drags!"
"You'll find various victims of abuse in [Kidnapping Mr. Heineken]... First, the titular abducted beer mogul Freddy Heineken, roughed up and chained to a wall. Then come us moviegoers, pummeled by heavy-handed dialogue."
Maybe they should have titled the hackneyed Take the Lead something like Shall We Dance...in Detention?
"Preaching to the same choir for 50 years, Schrader grew his audience with First Reformed and could've continued that momentum with this film but his questionable decisions regarding cast and plot resulted in a movie that is just average and forgettable."
Maybe I'm just a cat person.
"Perhaps the most oft-quoted line from 300 is ""Tonight, we dine in hell!"" Chowing down on a box of Butterfinger Minis during a screening of Meet the Spartans, you will truly understand what that line means."
The gift of art is that it can transform suffering into a form we can tolerate enough to be able to enlighten to something&#46; Like the sad state of our icon worship of the sad life of Marilyn&#46; But if it&apos;s pure pain and degradation&#44; is that really a gift&#63;
"It strives to deliver the painful truths of Sicario, but with none of that film's vicious elegance."
"What was the point of any of it? Only 'Dr. Boll' seems to know. On second thought, based on the evidence in front of the camera, maybe he doesn't."
Standard-issue for the point-and-shoot style that trains a camera on improvising actors. The outtakes might be hilarious.
"The reteaming of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly in ""Holmes & Watson"" as that celebrated detective duo Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson ignites few chuckles and absolutely no comedic fireworks."
DREW Barrymore tends to bring out the best in Adam Sandler - so much so that their re-teaming almost saves Blended.
"Even the worst moments aren't flamboyantly awful enough to earn a full gawk; they play closer to off-key, the clear result of post-production tinkering."
We're talking a jaw-dropping mix of the production values of Pootie Tang with the gross-out quality of Freddie Got Fingered.
"The kind of exaggerated, elitist Euro-farce that cinema snobs enjoy just because they know the unwashed masses wouldn't."
"While The Birth of a Nation certainly has a powerful and important story to tell, it is, ultimately, a story told with little depth or artistry or skill."
A protest movie about the war that -- follow me closely here -- doesn't actually protest the war.
Not even hardcore Zellweger fans should worry about catching this flick on the big screen.
"To launch their new album, the iconic 1970s rock band Status Quo indulges in a spirited action-comedy that might have worked when they were in their 20s."
"""The Hateful Eight"" is grotesquely violent and full of misogynists. I am overwhelmingly tired of Quentin Tarantino's shtick."
"As an attention-grabbing opening installment for what's obviously intended as an ongoing horror franchise, ""Jinn"" fizzles."
"A fairly well-made picture that's just been fairly well-made too many times before, a knock-off of a thousand other knock-offs."
I hope for their sake that this movie lets the Guit brothers get all of the immaturity out of their system and that their next movie is something that doesn't rely on shocking the audience every five minutes.
"An amazingly visual and technical film with a very captivating performance from Mark Rylance. However, the chemistry between him and Ruby Barnhill isn't as good, ending up in a emotionless and innocuous friendship. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Fonda looks great in that little black cocktail dress, but this studio remake robs the terrific original of its soul."
"The problem is that Apatow is stuck between gears. (That, and there's probably no one around him to say no at this point.)"
"Starts out brilliantly, chugs along quite nicely for a while, then wilts and dies just before it ends."
"There's nothing remarkable or even remotely intriguing about the dyspeptic gang of submental sad sacks in this dull, flat fiasco."
"The film resists analysis in its essayistic plainness. Though Morrison's writing is alive-jumping, soaring and diving deep-Greenfield-Sanders' film lays flat on the surface."
"This is an ugly, blue-tinged movie that telegraphs every plot turn."
"The best that can be said is that the actors are all first-rate. The characters they play, on the other hand, may leave you feeling a bit down."
"Slaboshpytskiy doesn't attempt to get inside the psychology of these people, or expand the meanings, political or otherwise, of their descent."
On its own&#44; admittedly limited terms&#44; &#8220;Call Jane&#8221; fills its goal of celebrating the work of a group of women committed to fighting for a right denied them in the sixties&#8212;and would undoubtedly feel they must now fight for again&#46;            
"The staging of loud, destructive, effects-laden set pieces seems to elude the director's grasp-and, unfortunately, that's what Fast & Furious movies are all about."
"All the ingredients are there, but it doesn't quite come together."
"Ultimately, it's rather like Oasis themselves: Too bloody much of a just-pretty-good thing. Of course, diehard Britpop devotees may feel otherwise."
"The problem is the pace, which suffers when demands of explication force Howard to pull his foot off the gas."
"The story is mostly formless and, as a result, rather disorienting."
"Renée Zellweger can reach all the notes and hit all the marks, but Garland's high-tension-wire emoting eludes her."
A humorless foray of noise and fast-cuts signifying nothing much.
Nobody involved with Zoom seems to get the appeal of comic books or kid superheroes. It doesn't help that the film was clearly produced on the cheap.
"Way too much anti-drone argument is spouted here as exposition, especially among the drone operators. Dissent becomes on-the-job insubordination in a way the military would surely not tolerate."
Trade has cojones for trying to lay the kind of political guilt trip it does on us with its sham aesthetics and lurid telenovela-writ-large storyline.
Expect no surprises from yet another needless remake.
Listen Up Philip [is] an uneven mixture of satire and homage.
A well-intentioned but uninvolving anti-war documentary.
"The movie never breaks the surface of its characters or their situation. And Mr. Rock's paint-by-numbers approach as director only compounds the movie's flat, formulaic feel."
"It's similar to a superficially hip and irreverent, yet fundamentally sentimental, TV show."
A predictable and not-bold-enough account of the struggles of a band of National Guard soldiers after returning home from the war in Iraq.
"I sense the movie is payback time for Fey: She's just as bitchy as the Plastics are, and at least the Plastics don't push their rivals in front of trucks."
"These women are ready for action, but the fur never flies."
Chandor and Boal&#8217;s collaboration on Triple Frontier is the first blemish on their practically pristine resumes&#59; a generic&#44; by-the-numbers heist thriller camouflaged with a false social consciousness&#46;
"features Acting with a capital ""A,"" pulled off by serious thespians putting years of training to the test."
"In the end, Creation takes a huge and potentially fascinating story and evolves it into a piddly cliche."
"Vice's downfall may be the scriptwriter's fascination with the subject matter and his resulting indignation, leading him to neglect the promised humour, and even overlook the film's structure, making the plotline hard to follow at times."
"Cruise crushes this movie under his weight, pushing everything interesting to the fringes of the frame."
"Chaotic coming-of-age drama with teen sex, drugs."
"Pitiful entertainment, succeeding neither as spectacle, as action-adventure, or as love story."
"Has worthwhile moments, including an excellent performance by [George] Clooney, but the plotting is contrived."
"observant, to be sure, but curiously, not that funny"
"The movie plays it real safe, as the only users the audience sees are the flashy Hollywood types that no one cares about."
"This is garbage. It's pretty garbage inhabited by pretty people in pretty surroundings, but it's still garbage."
"The picture seems reverse-engineered, as if, having conceived his spectacular milieu, Conran created monsters to populate it, then heroes for them to fight, then reasons for the heroes to be there, with emotional plausibility some way behind that."
"Wild, disturbing, and it made no sense."
"The movie churns out his story like sausage meat: turgidly linear, and tasteless in a literal sense of dead-on-the-palate."
The only thing that's a godsend about this movie is when the closing credits finally start rolling.
A drag in more ways than one...'Juwanna' skip this miserable 'Tootsie' knockoff.
"If the point of the movie was to show what a teenage sociopath looks like, then congratulations. Mission accomplished. If the goal was to present a meaningful story, then this movie is a failure."
"A thin, insipid and oddly flavourless brew. Drink it responsibly. Better yet, don't drink it at all."
"Day of the Soldado de-fangs the previous film's critiques, softening its monsters into begrudgingly necessary tools for justice."
"This was a close shave, but it just didn't cut it for me."
A time-waster&#46;
"You realize what it must be like to be trapped in detention with a bunch of 15-year-old boys who think there's nothing more hilarious than repeating the same jokes about porn, pot, and pulling your pud over and over again. It's funny, until it's not."
"Yes, I'm exaggerating but you get my drift. On the other hand, if this sounds like your cup of (poisonous) tea, go for it..."
The Whale is indefensible&#44; turning out to be a silly melodrama that views its protagonist with a loathing it tries to present as empathy&#46; &#91;Full review in Portuguese&#93;
Take OUR advice and avoid this misfired comedy about a couple seeking marriage counseling from the wrong person.
Goes down for the count in a hodgepodge of emotions and familiar boxing-movie conventions.
Let's be blunt: It's a place to dump the kids off for 89 minutes.
"What keeps ""Trick"" from attaining its lofty ""Creepshow"" aspirations is the lack of conflict and resolution."
Salazar has managed to drain all life out of what should naturally be a most lively project.
...just another junky January thriller where logic is thrown under the bus in favor of enough red herrings to open a fishmonger's and 'twists' that exist for their momentary spin.
"Hillcoat brings stray moments of style and surprise to ""Triple 9"" but not nearly enough to save it; for every twist you don't see coming, there are five you probably will."
...the film is more of a deafening flatline than a racing pulse.
"Like a one-hit wonder desperately clinging to the pop charts as its lone hit fades into history, M. Night Shyamalan appears to be grasping at straws."
"An interminably long, numbingly slow and woefully underdeveloped epic that is more likely to bring on drowsiness than enlightenment."
Romeo is most notable for being the first film of the year to cash in on post-Bobbitt fears of castrating (and worse) females.
"Ghost Ship is a bit of a fun ride while it lasts, but it's not likely to get many viewers to line up for a return voyage."
"Sam Elliott's low-key masculinity is showcased in The Hero, a dreary character study without much else to recommend it."
I kept fantasizing about how great this film would have been if Eric Rohmer had made it.
"Mildly amusing but ultimately a sloppy, forgettable enterprise."
...are teens so narcissistic today that they film themselves crying into their phones waiting to be killed off? Maybe they should have called this 'The Shallows.'
"Next time the aliens come invading, they may want to pass the brains, hold the lecture."
"Scoob! falls short in giving the core characters the adventure they deserve, but it does lay some fun groundwork for possible stories still to be told."
"Kasdan's film -- like King's book -- is too long, and loses its way less than an hour in, once the stuck-in-the-woods-with-a-monster horror plot turns into something else."
The film ... contains a nude shot of Andy Richter's rear end. Surely you do not need any more convincing than that to stay away.
Admirable if fundamentally academic.
In the Land of Women doesn't for a moment feel messy and chaotic where it counts.
This well-intentioned film is so bound up in cotton wool that it doesn't have the impact its story deserves.
"The landscape of Wild Hogs is cluttered with the comic equivalent of suburban sprawl, an endless cyclorama of rehashed jokes and whiny complaint."
"Crushingly unfunny, it's a must to avoid."
"If you have a taste for the blissfully awful, it might be worth renting when it hits video."
"The Legend of Zorro commits a lot of movie sins, but one is mortal: It turns the magnificent Elena into a nag."
"No film that offers both Walton Goggins and Olivia Colman can be dismissed out of hand. They are among our best actors, and here give solid performances. But Them That Follow left me wanting more."
"Begins as a psychological thriller, transforms into a supernatural bonce-scratcher and finally descends into an almighty mess."
"Audiences who go to Dreamgirls will have a good time, but theyll be going for old times sake rather than to encounter anything vital or new."
A Big Mac with a mineral water chaser.
We are coaxed to rejoice in the name of vengeance.
"Clumsily wedged in like a TV commercial between deafening stunts, the emotional storytelling sinks without a trace."
"Certainly, filmgoers are treated to martial arts action, but nothing as stressful or as thrilling as in Chan's earlier films."
"While normally this type of film may still be salvageable to pulp fans if it had a sharp eye for aesthetics or a particularly gruesome edge to its fight scenes, Night Teeth can't even boast either of those elements in its favor."
"What is an issue is that ""This Means War"" does not fulfill the most basic requirement of a romcom: that we want the couple to get together."
Critical miscalculations at every turn have taken this latest (and hopefully last) Hannibal movie beyond the realm of camp and into that special hell reserved for only the most rancid of sequels.
"Maybe ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"" doesn't pack the punch of the original because there's no revelation."
"Kate gestures at being different, something fresh and subversive, but at the end of the day, it's just reheating old clichés."
"The kind of movie that makes you wish you could rinse your brain in bleach, to wash all traces of it from your memory."
"Appropriately enough, a bogus Hollywood prestige picture is exactly what we get with US remake Secret in Their Eyes."
"If you can't guess where these ""Crooked Arrows"" are going, you aren't getting out enough. But Routh is wonderfully light and laid back here, perhaps thanks to the low stakes this tiny film has."
A whirl of action going nowhere fast.
The overall tenor is clangorously discordant.
"In Joe Swanberg's disaffected little film, the drama is never explicit, or even fully conscious."
"The stars lack the charisma, the comic energy and the overall appeal of the A-listers playing supporting roles. That's a fundamental miscalculation."
"As action thrillers go Unknown is not a bad one, and it has real ambitions to character and theme ... on the other hand it's not quite a good one either as the filmmakers can never quite decide what time of film they want to make."
"It's one of those movies that plays to the cheap seats, making the racism bigger, the assimilation process rougher, and the family squabbles extra-broad, lest viewers miss the point."
"Frequently has you asking, 'Who was this movie supposed to be for?'"
"In the absence of narrative, directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield fall back on the prevalent nature-TV escape hatch of anthropomorphizing what would otherwise be dull."
"Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie look like they had a terrific time making Mr. and Mrs. Smith -- but I certainly didn't have a good time watching it. Neither, I suspect, will many of you."
"In not knowing who it needs to please, I Want to Believe pleases no one."
Shyamalan doesn&#8217;t care&#44; working to craft a thriller&#44; chiller&#44; and offering of enlightenment&#44; and it doesn&#8217;t matter if any of these moviemaking pieces fit correctly&#46;&#10;
"The credits are the most fascinating part of ""Margin Call."""
"A film that spends nearly two hours advancing already axiomatic notions-obscene opulence does not equal freedom; protocol is a prison-with easy ironies, weighty symbols, and portentous phrases."
"Year of the Dogis long-time screenwriter White's first turn as director, and he leans on the crutch of the written word to spell everything out. It leaves Dog with a conclusion that feels dictated rather than dramatized."
This bizarre and horrendously misjudged combination of Spielberg whimsy and harsh thriller is a thoroughly perplexing watch.
If you love the MCU and loads of cartoonish CGI violence&#44; then you&#8217;ll love &#8220;The Gray Man&#46;&quot; If you&#8217;ve read the books&#44; avoid the movie at all costs&#46; If you haven&apos;t read the books&#8212;read them&#46; It&apos;s a whole summer&apos;s worth of thoroughly engrossing page-turning&#46;
"Blessedly written by someone who's not Sandler--and it's almost passable, even palatable ... until the movie throws in vagina-size jokes. And passes off tomboys as weird non-men. And goes to ""Africa."""
The film suffers from pacing problems and an unfortunate usage of its female lead.
"The blend of Johnson's laid-back hero-dudeness and Hart's whippet-fast comic timing should have been good fun. But somebody, alas, had an idea, though not a good one: Make Johnson the comedian and Hart the straight man."
"The film moves with the slowness of an opium daze, and it transmits its plot information with the incremental dit-dot-dash of a wire message."
The fun of The Expendables is that it makes you want to watch Rocky and Mad Max and Blade and Desperado all over again.
"With all the thematic false starts and missed opportunity, The Brave One boils down to violence begets violence, and says it cures all the pain of loss."
"It's just a shame the end product feels so middle of the road, something fun to watch in the moment but ultimately forgettable"
"In the end, I wanted this tempest back in its teapot and off the screen. (Parental Review also available)"
The movie slowly begins to descend into a vacuous state because the contrived script really has no place to go.
"A loo book written by Pol Pot would have more laughs than this chillingly unfunny, cynically prefabricated non-comedy."
"It may not make a lasting impression, but at the same time you may find its first half teasingly, tantalizingly good fun and its second half, well, who knows."
"Prince is directing this time out, and even more so than in Under the Cherry Moon, the man proves he has no idea what to do behind the camera"
Fast-paced but dumb.
The production comes off as little more than a variation of a well-worn theme.
It just kind of fell apart for me.
"A serviceable animated adventure movie for kids, hitting all the requisite family-friendly beats without ever transcending them."
"It's not a complete power failure, but it's close."
Don't bother to stop for The Hitcher remake.
"Like too many of Mr. Williams's recent movies, Patch Adams wastes the genius of a peerless clown."
Recycled humor -- and recycled heart -- from a host of former sports dramedies dating back to The Bad News Bears.
"It's an odd misfire from two actors at the peak of their game, but a misfire nonetheless."
...a film franchise that once showed life but now deserves to be sealed up and buried far beneath the sea.
full review at Movies for the Masses
There are a number of genuinely clever twists and ideas that it's unfortunate that someone decided to muck it up with cheap slapstick.
"Star power isn't a problem in this episodic rendering of Truman Capote's novel. A scattershot story without focus is, which is why the film soon evaporates from the memory."
"Besides the unconvincing shift of psychic gears, the picture has no theme, no resonance, no point."
The movie starts out as a disaster but climbs up to average entertainment status.
Who decided that a horrorfest set in an underground parking garage needed to be made?
"As a whole I am vastly underwhelmed by I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House. It is stylish and beautiful, but lacked the substance to make it a complete story."
"The Lion King overhunts the terrain of its predecessor, a lifeless remake that inhabits the shadowlands of nostalgia."
"We hate [Madonna] within the film's first five minutes, and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground."
"Diego... lacks any nuance as a character. He is grim and humorless, like most everything else about this film."
Fonda's Georgia is hatchet-swinging Carrie Nation and bromide-bleating Dr. Phil rolled into one.
Tyler Perry's The Single Moms Club is a lackluster empowerment fantasy that veers between dull and embarrassing.
This frenetic kids' comedy about a ker-razy family and all the wacky mishaps that befall them is neither terrible nor horrible. It's just adequate -- a message-heavy montage of chaos and engineered hilarity.
"Insufficiently developed characters, awkwardly acted scenes, embarrassing dialogue: M. Night Shyamalan has made some awful movies in his day, but Old is one of his worst."
This is a box of rancid chocolates of rare stupidity.
The Dead Don't Die has all the components of a cult classic but was not executed properly. It's all over the place & not even a stellar performance by Adam Driver can save it.
"It takes forever for the film to even get to the start of the baseball season. But once it does, it's pretty engaging."
far too derivative of other angsty independent romances that it failed to keep my attention
Scarlett -- a pretty young archeologist who favors allowing her sweater to slip coyly off one shoulder to expose a fashionable bra strap while she's vandalizing ancient relics -- may be the year's most absurd movie character.
Laboriously reworks one of the most well-known origin stories in superhero comics.
"A strong cast of likable and, yes, beautiful actors can only do so much with the formula in which they're forced to work."
"A bland romance that suffers from choppy development, dramatic overload and dearth of personality."
"There is also no real emotional investment for the viewer with the characters in ""The Shape of Things,"" with the exception of a charming and likable performance by Gretchen Mol."
Ya-Ya. Yuk-Yuk.
... struggles to develop meaningful character depth and emotional complexity amid its barrage of elaborate globetrotting set pieces that are its very reason for existence.
"In a post-Walk Hard world, Respect doesn't stand a chance. Respect is full of information about Aretha Franklin, but despite the music there's just no energy... Concert scenes look like bad cell phone videos uploaded to YouTube."
"Yes, the master of the disaster blockbuster, Roland Emmerich is back – and this time he’s not only lost the plot, he’s jettisoned any semblance of coherence into deep space."
"First, the script is dumb."
"Sure, there's action, but these scenes seem more about shaking things up todistract the viewer from the overly convoluted, disjointed and nonsensical plot."
'Scuse me while I diss the Skyscraper.
"While there's an amiable looseness to the picture's initial half and some welcome tartness to the second, each is, in its own way, equally contrived."
"If it's slicing and dicing you're after, the butchers at the Berkeley Bowl can give you a much more entertaining show and send you home with a spectacular cut of meat."
Seyfried and Tatum have absolutely no credibility as a romantic couple.
"Finally, a movie that can vie with Gigli as the worst feature of the new millennium."
The Pale Blue Eye hits a plateau in its gothic horror storytelling and never musters convincing tension to break from it&#46;
"I can think of no good reason to recommend that you buy a ticket to see the Coen brothers remake of The Ladykillers. Unless, of course, you're feeling charitable."
"I never felt Stella and Winston were on the same wavelength, that they could share their lives, that it would be a good idea for them to try."
"To its credit, The Burning Plain grapples with some of the big questions human beings face, but its reach exceeds its grasp."
"[The Snowman] is two hours of uninterrupted, snow-caked boredom."
"This is a silly, moderately funny fantasy fit for kids whose parents care about them too much to ever let them run around unsupervised at an airport."
"Be Kind Rewind, while erring just this side of too adorable for its own good - it's nothing if not enjoyable for once again showcasing Gondry's ingenious guerilla filmmaking tactics - is still a bit of a setback."
No doubt it takes as much know-how to pull off this kind of action movie as it does to craft an intimate drama about an extramarital affair. But it's an achievement that has little to do with art.
Dreary sci-fi adventure.
Tepid. Lukewarm. Mediocre. Bland. Sluggish. Perfunctory. Dull. Anemic.
"Kika is not good for several reasons. For one, Almodovar tries to get too serious."
"There's a certain sense of violation on the viewer's part, to have all one's trusted suspension of disbelief suddenly run over by such a barrage of easy clich."
"There are movies that are so bad they're good, and then there are movies that are so bad they're completely awesome."
"Although Ana Lily Amirpour's new The Bad Batch has much higher production values, her A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night is a tough act to follow, and Batch is a bit of a letdown even if you haven't seen Amirpour's stellar debut."
"Inconsistencies in character behavior undermine the storytelling throughout. When things are so glaring that they make you stop and say, ""Hey, hold on a second, why did - "" you know there are problems."
Excessive at worst and depraved at best.
My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 sits there like a potted plant in the center of a bundt cake: mildly amusing but mostly useless.
Depictions of violence against women do little to allow its character autonomy and there is only so much room for provocation until... the story needs a sense of momentum
[A] garbage movie.
"Sure, it's memorable, but it's far too unwieldy to be effective."
"National Lampoon's Van Wilder may aim to be the next Animal House, but it more closely resembles this year's version of Tomcats."
"For a director who's tackled big themes so often, Malick finds little worthy of his gifts in the field of male solipsism."
"The film rests on the attractive but opaque Ms. Thorne, who is not ready for such weight."
But everybody looks so...pretty!
"The movie practically begs you to indulge your inner child. But the adult in me prevailed, and I spent too much of the running time desperate to scream at the screen: Grow up already."
The film ascribes to a conventionally contrapuntal take on the lives of those who spend all day surrounded by death.
"The music is inspired and the cast terrifically committed, but Ray is still a long way from being a good movie."
This tentative questioning of the sometimes unscrupulous methods and deleterious consequences of political correctness is further undermined by Ted's insipid character and general indifference to his fate.
Although it admirably tackles cyberbullying&#44; identity theft&#44; mental health&#44; and affirmative action&#44; this coming-of-age drama lacks the subtlety or surprise to make a deeper impact&#46;
"This film's distributors insisted I watch this with a public audience. For the record, out of nine people who started watching this with me, only six lasted the course. You've been warned."
"I didn't find it funny at all... It works at 15 minutes, but not so well at 90 minutes."
"The movie seemed to be getting along fine without the melodrama. At times, it seems to be getting along just fine without Carter, but maybe that's just me."
"The entire thing is so relentlessly bright and breezy that, much like the scrunchy-faced pooch himself, it eventually wins you over, even if it never quite delivers the promised laughs."
"Warning: this film contains scenes of incest, masturbation, gerontophilia, statutory rape and Adam Sandler."
"Obviously, it's supposed to be real hot stuff, but we couldn't work up even a lukewarm interest in what would happen to any of its people -- who are either completely vicious or completely wish-washy."
"As Hoffman's Master strives to impress w/eloquent language, fine suits and psychic parlor tricks, serving as cerebral misdirection, so too does Anderson, similarly pulling elaborate wool over our eyes. Quoting Ms. Stein: There is no there there."
"Instead of killing people, Nicolas Cage's character should have been more worried about getting a haircut."
"Rebel Wilson is a great supporting actress (e.g. all the ""Pitch Perfect"" movies) but as the star of this film her talent bends under the weight. She needs someone to share the spotlight."
"This Technicolor goof on parallel-universe nostalgia has a serious timing problem. It plays like a '50s sitcom, and not the good, I Love Lucy kind."
"This is a fascinating subject and Shen's heart is clearly in the right place. But a touch more wit, warmth and wonder would not have gone amiss."
"Given the low budget, special effects-which range from serviceable to amateurish-aren't much of a draw here. Neither is the story, which leans heavily on cheesy formula ..."
"When they get to space, though, Space Chimps turns shrill and ugly. The film's designers seem to have run out of money."
"Love the play, but this film adaptation left a bad taste in my mouth."
Pointless. Heartbreaking.
"If this movie were even half as hip as it thinks, it'd die from an overdose of coolness."
"None of this, as you might guess, is shot through a glass darkly."
"While parts one and two built momentum to an exhausting, exhilarating climax, part three has too many peaks and valleys (and, it seems, more of the latter than the former)."
"Babylon approaches the creation of set-piece moments and vast, crowded scenes with commendable gusto, but lacks subtlety and rarely dips below its own glittering surface."
'Vanguard' features Jackie Chan ... and not much else.
"The fate of the world always seems to rest on the outcome of the big game. And after the umpteenth big game, we're long past caring."
"Everyone looks like they're struggling to appear human, and only one has a huge, fishy tail as an excuse."
"The story lacks focus. The senses blur as wives and ex-wives come and go, and Harry regularly falls off the wagon, only to reform the next day."
"Underground is a bizarre, often repellent anti-war parable that takes forever to state the obvious but hits some scattered high notes on the way."
"There's just enough to stop it from being a complete bore. But, come the end, you'll still think it wasn't worth your time."
"Bad, stupid, lame, embarrassing, and seemingly interminable, full of main characters delivering long-winded speeches explaining their histories from childhood so we'll be sure to understand their motivations, which are murky and trite..."
"It's at a constant screech, which is numbing and dull, and results in an unemotional end to an otherwise harmless saga."
"Most audiences are likely to emerge dazed and a little goofy, convinced they've seen a humdinger, but unable to quite describe it."
"True to Chekhov's dictum, a gun does fire near the end -- by which point eye-rolling audience members may be up in arms too."
"It's inevitable with such fantasies, the storylines begin to have a familiar ring. Rry as they might, the filmmakers here are never totally successful in narrowing the gap between reality and fantasy as live action and fantastical special effects converge"
"In the end, this film suffocates you with ersatz compassion and personal growth."
"City Hall lacks that sort of nuanced, curious approach to its material, and in its absence, Wiseman doesn't have much to offer beyond standard homage to contemporary liberalism."
Bay seems to think that just showing us a bunch of brightly clashing metallic limbs (accompanied by lots of noise) is enough to make us faint in our seats with excitement.
It tries hard. Too hard.
So-so entertainment.
"A long, boring video game that's more dumb than fun."
Particularly silly...the sort of emptily bombastic popcorn movie that might make you wish you had a surrogate to go and sit through it in your place.
We get five minutes of halfway-decent action that hardly makes up for the other 90 minutes of this lukewarm diarreah-fest.
Predictable exploitation with little in the way of surprise.
"This is Wan's first major Hollywood production after more than a decade of profitable horror outings including Saw and Insidious, and it's disappointing that neither the gonzo gore of the former nor the calculating restraint of the latter register here."
Black Gold feels like it could have been made in the 1950s; we have come to expect a little more from our blockbusters.
It is lazy and a shame. It is Shaft lite.
Are there three more terrifying words in the English language than 'Jerry Bruckheimer Presents'?
The steely-eyed seriousness of the enterprise -- the refusal to coddle moviegoers with warm characters or even attractive cinematography -- is alienating.
Egregiously wastes the talents of three of today's most promising young comedic actors.
A movie for those who download Justin Bieber songs and have to come home when the street lights turn on.
"Here, Tolan and McCulloch manage the impossible -- they turn two eccentric performers (Lee and Tom Green) into the cinematic equivalents of Melba toast and rice crackers."
"Rooted by a nice sense of place but, much like its real life namesake, Homecoming isn't age-appropriate for everyone -- maybe just those in high school, or barely removed. Others will likely find the familiarity more humdrum than effectively nostal"
"Hot-button subject matter proves surprisingly less than compelling in Anthony Woodley's The Flood, a film about a British immigration officer interviewing a high-profile detainee."
"...for a film that claims to be an ode to journalism, even each individual tale seems to skimp on story and character, instead relying on idiosyncratic charm and Anderson's own panache to get by."
An irreverent dark comedy whose style outpaces its substance.
Paranoia is so ineptly made that the ride home from the theater will be more suspenseful than anything that took place on the screen.
"Results seems interested in one day becoming a comedy, and in a few scenes, manages to muster enough energy to be described as droll."
Torpid and polarising.
"A fast-paced and serviceable thriller, dressed in second-hand religious mumbo jumbo, that relies on constant forward momentum to ensure its audience doesn't have time to stop and think about it too much."
"If ""Bridget Jones's Baby"" is the best an actress like Zellweger can expect from the film industry, maybe she'd be better off just saying ""Hashtag: Let's not."""
"This is a paint-by-numbers romance without a trace of subtlety, wit or sophistication."
"This is your ordinary funny-to-treacly plot arc -- funny if you're 10 or younger, treacly if you're older."
"...The film works much better as a tongue-in-cheek comedy than a thriller, but I doubt del Toro intended that."
"Successful only in sullying the memory of a superior movie that didn't warrant a sequel, particularly one so glaringly lacking in imagination and purpose."
"Perversely sordid, some of the creepy soft-core scenes cross the lurid line of bad taste."
The various oddities on display take away the focus...
"On its own, Glass isn't a well-rounded standalone film."
"Woefully, Natural Selection is unable to deliver. From the script to production quality, it plays off as overdone and out of touch."
"Sequences fade into the pack and make it difficult to differentiate one player from the others, much less remember them after the lights go up."
Zookeeper is essentially a surreally awful Happy Madison Productions version of Mad Libs.
"More polished verbally, but alarmingly unexpressive nonetheless, Bernal appears to have learned one essential trick of the budding movie star: When floundering, flash that irresistible horndog grin."
"So dark it's mostly impossible to see what's going on, which is probably a blessing as the imagery I could see was an unpleasant mix of motherhood and sexual violence."
"A pretty lousy movie in general, though it's the film's somewhat accusatory Iraq War subject matter that's getting it some attention -- deserved or not -- that makes the whole thing a little distasteful."
Aggressive in its insistence on being as awful as possible.
"In The Cave of the Yellow Dog, set in Mongolia, the dog is cute, the children are adorable, and the earth and the sky seem to stretch on without limit."
Ever notice that sports movies that mean to inspire us with the message that winning isn't everything almost always end up with a victory?
The slow-moving story is as dry as the desert wind that blows through Jericho.
"Veers from Visconti's The Damned to Jonathan Demme's The Silence of the Lambs without the decadence or the thrills of either. In this case, the victim is Larsson."
Less a searing examination of sociopolitical issues than a Death Wish reconfigured for leftist viewers.
"Not bad as an introduction to a group, but it makes for a lousy portrait of its members."
"Feels cobbled together from George Orwell, ""THX-1138,"" ""The Giver,"" perfume commercials and the Apple Store. Heck, before this thing's over, Parker even steals one of Shakespeare's better-known end-of-Act-II plot twists."
"[The filmmakers] insist, none too convincingly, that animals are capable of consenting to fulfilling their sexual needs. Wilburrrrr!!"
It's underheated for the first hour or so and absurdly overplotted in its final act.
"Somewhere within the bones of Selah and the Spades is a terrific high school movie but sadly, there's a feel of missed opportunity that permeates this frustratingly opaque film."
"All the men in Afghanistan -- native and invasive -- are struggling to survive, to make order of rocky chaos."
"The title might sound risque but the end product is as safe, cosy and unoriginal as a Now That's What I Call Music Christmas gift."
Duhamel and Wiggins unfortunately don't have the kind of Paper Moon chemistry that could have helped gloss over some of the harder-to-swallow plot turns.
"Even as the stakes are raised in Secretary's sexual give and take, the movie retains its detached, private mood."
"Everything about Leonard's Jackie-v-Marilyn dilemma is socked over with Gray's trademark sincerity, but I found it difficult to credit, and his situation, though viewed through the smoked glass of gloomy realism, is an indulgent fantasy."
"If movies were fireworks, Smith's latest effort would be a fuse-moistened bottle rocket that only manages subdued flight."
Many heroic abilities are on display - but cracking jokes isn't one of them.
"If Tennessee Williams's script for Joseph Losey's 1968 turkey Boom! saw the light of day, just how bad must a Williams screenplay unproduced for decades be?"
"A fairly indistinct Tex-Mex time-filler that soon gets lost amid memories of cooler, dustier, sweatier tear-ups."
A fairly deadly case of canned theater that's pretty close to what Hitchcock many years later would refer to as 'photographs of people talking.'

More concerned with forcing random humor within its setup than finding the real humor that's there.
"If there were an award for mangiest set decoration, See No Evil -- a routine slasher film set in a condemned hotel -- might cop it."
"It may be non-stop action, but it's boring action - where was the ""Left Hand of God"" when they really needed evil to be wiped out (obviously not in the editing room)."
In spite of a great cast this film fails to get across any discernable point.
"[D]ear lord, I've been searching high and low for something nice to say about this mess, and I have come up nearly empty."
"Mucho brillo y color y poca sustancia dramática en esta tragedia épica que emula tanto a Shakespeare como a Kurosawa. Vale la pena sólo por su aspecto visual y, sobre todo, por la siempre intensa Gong Li."
"You can kind of see in here the blueprints for something really fun and unique, but instead it just comes off as disjointed."
"All in all, it wasn't an unpleasant revisiting of a great musical; it just wasn't a particularly coherent or revelatory one. Now someone just needs to mount a Broadway revival and cast Ms. Hudson in it."
"Was this bonbon to the show's fans, four years after the ""happily ever after"" series finale, really necessary?"
"The film just doesn't make a lot of sense, and it's not compelling enough to make it worth the effort to try and figure out."
Something went terribly wrong. Scorsese made an ambitious bid with Casino. But he seems to have been overpowered by his material.
...an entertaining enough sit which should please its target audience.
With Scream VI&#44; Scream &#40;2022&#41; filmmakers Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett are so interested in reinventing Wes Craven&#8217;s saga and keeping audiences guessing and grossed out that they&#8217;ve made a film that makes no impact at all&#46; 
"I can't criticise McCallum for wanting to make something that aspired to being more than just a trashy thriller, but the air of overbearing self-seriousness that surrounds every scene will leave many an audience wishing that it was just that."
I think Wask Network is another example of something that would have worked much better as a miniseries. [Full Review in Spanish]
"The cause is just and the ambition is admirable, but the result is middling in both the writing and directing departments."
"This is not Wilde. It's tame and dreary, with no energy, suspense or horror. When the picture of Dorian's demonic soul is finally uncovered, it resembles not so much evil incarnate as the late Max Wall."
Greta falls apart because of the absolute lack of internal logic within each of the situations. [Full Review in Spanish]
"For much of the time, it's a desultory tour through period movie hell, complete with carefully aged costumes and cement-like chunks of exposition."
For a better part of the first half-hour&#44; Kosinski&#8217;s film conceals its cards&#44; to appear &#8216;cerebral&#8217;&#46; As the latter hour reveals&#44; it&#8217;s not as smart as it thinks it is&#46; In fact&#44; it is not smart at all&#46;
"Bello is an excellent actress and makes Sophie's anguish credible, although she can't rise above the material."
"Gangster Squad looks the part, but it's so superficial it practically evaporates before our eyes."
"Mildly amusing for kids, never quite entertaining for the adults who will be dragged to it, ""The Croods"" actually gets the most out of its mediocrity."
It never goes deep on what it was that produced the awfulness that is Lance Armstrong.
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter proves that there's nothing left in the tank of this grossly nondescript zombie-shootin' franchise.
Haven't we all seen this already? Many times? Too many times?
"If we're to judge a movie by how well a director succeeds at accomplishing what he set out to accomplish, then Donnybrook is at best a demonstration of [Tim] Sutton's technical abilities."
Never comes close to matching its subject's passion.
The title says it all
Tragically bad.
"A piece of dotty, slightly paranoid intrigue. Three Days of the Condor promises little and keeps its word. It is hard to get indignant about it, or enthusiastic either."
"Homosexuality for dummies. That is, until Ving Rhames steals everybody else's thunder as the most macho guy in the firehouse and on the down low, who decides it's time to finally come out in the communal shower."
Parental Guidance should be rated X - suitable for no one.
Please DO stop the music! A '70s disco holdover.
"Remaking Get Smart for the big screen might have sounded like a bad idea, but the movie shows it to have been something else: a really bad idea."
Benedict Cumberbatch's egotistical Ironman-meets-House-MD persona keeps us in the game - if only just. He shares more chemistry with his eccentric levitation cloak than with most humans in the film.
Cars is - dare I say it? - a little on the dull side.
"Just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another, making Ararat far more demanding than it needs to be."
"This is record label-approved hagiography, and those doing the approving seem to see Mercury's sexual orientation as a character flaw he must overcome."
"The story is bloated and, despite flashes of imagination, overly familiar."
Stretches forty-five minutes of material to two hours in order to satisfy the ignorant two-parter conclusion.
All the character actors in the world can't save Godzilla 2: King of the Monsters from calamity.
"Candy-colored slapstick and kindergarten-level humor make this perfectly suitable for small children, and perfectly bland and inoffensive to the adults accompanying them. Somehow, I don't think Dr. Seuss would entirely approve."
James Kent's drama always misses hard questions and emotional truths in favor of soft-focus melodrama.
"A slight improvement over the 2008 original, which is not saying much."
The movie lacks tension.
"Less of an insane soap opera than a lot of Sparks-based movies, so you could do worse."
"Each vignette is fine, as far as it goes, but none go very far."
"...although it looks good, it feels fragmented, the action never coming fully to life and the central character rather colorless."
Freddy's nails are a little blunt here
"[T]he synthesis between those in front of and behind the camera rarely feels lost. It's perverse, beautiful, and brutal... and it rarely seems to last that long."
Spiderhead is a very cerebral movie and not for everyone&#46;
"As earnest and thoughtful as A Sun can be, its sheer length has us parsing the differences between languishing and lingering."
[McConaughey's] intensity never flags. What's missing from this story of struggle and glory and the need to believe is a fever to match his.
"It's a thriller void of thrills, wasting the time of the cast and the audience."
"Lords of Chaos can't seem to find its center for the entirety of its indulgent two-hour runtime. From moment to moment, the mood shifts from comic to dramatic to horrific to exploitative"
...ideal for Adam Sandler fans who were confused by Punch-Drunk Love.
"The movie makes the most of what it has, which, as it turns out, isn't an awful lot."
It’s not very good.
"The worst flaw however is not this risible retake on history or legend but the lack of momentum. ""The Highwaymen"" dawdles. Handsomely mounted, it depicts not a pulse-quickening chase but a slow, pokey crawl."
"A disappointing, trite comedy overrun with African-American stereotypes."
"By some bizarre alchemy, How to Lose Friends and Alienate People has been translated to the screen as a Judd Apatow romantic comedy crossed with The Devil Wears Prada."
"Sibyl is far less than the sum of its parts, and never manages to shake off a heavy tone which consistently threatens to capsize even the rare funny interludes."
"Prince's 1984 movie debut seems more like his deification, with an aggressively stupid plot line that serves only to set him up as a paragon of artistic integrity, sexual prowess, and superhuman sensitivity."
"So do you think the war on terror is one big joke? ... Even if you do, this is comedy that, for all its heavy-handed political satire, just isn't funny."
"Although Mr. Brenon has included the tragic note at the end, he has succumbed to a number of ordinary movie flashes without inculcating much in the way of subtlety. Neither he nor the players have succeeded in fully developing the characters."
Hyper-assaultive.
"A pew-pounding musical drama starring Queen Latifah, Keke Palmer, and the skeletal remains of Dolly Parton."
Fails to offer skeptics a way into the worldview of these characters other than a tacit acceptance of its 'truth.'
"The pacing was a little too fast...a lot of it was far-fetched, super horror-like."
"De la Torre seeks an expression that may want to be artistic but is only technical, with a staging of spectacular appearance that hides a rehash of obvious references and nothing original. [Full Review in Spanish]"
This is not a movie. This is nothing but Adam Sandler hanging out with his pals and congratulating himself on how awesome he finds himself to be.
"Becker, who made the first instalment just about passable, is bland here while Alessandro Nivola, who plays his best pal, looks rightly bored."
"""It,"" that generic title, demonstrates that in pop culture, there is always a second chapter. There's no such thing as just one evil clown."
Never manages to capture the same bark as its predecessor.
"Just when it seems All About Steve couldn't grow any more insufferable, it turns strangely sentimental."
Rhymes with bore.
"Why should a man of Mr. Scorsese's talent be giving us what amounts to no more than a film buff's essay on a pop-film form that was never, at any point in film history, of the first freshness?"
Lush scenery encircles two laconic characters in this static movie.
"Think metaphorically again, and see that Suicide Squad entangles post-Vietnam and post-9/11 notions about heroism and citizenship...Suicide Squad is The Dirty Dozen for millennial viewers (and voters), who think their patriotic moral conflict is new."
"It often feels inauthentic, sometimes preachy."
What could have inspired such lazy filmmaking?
Call DC Comics the Donald Trump of blockbusters.
"Stewart's Snow White, meanwhile, pouts her lips, bats her bedroom eyes, and scarcely seems to have more on her mind than who might take her to the senior prom"
"The real shock came when I noticed that a woman filing out of the premiere screening beside me had actually marked her rating card with an ""excellent"" grade."
"This movie could obviously go on fooling us forever, but we are good sports only up to a point, and then our attention drifts."
All the characters were utterly annoying... the second thing was the cheese factor in this movie was very high.
"The film needs to be edited down by at least 20 minutes. It plays like a video game, one unrealistic stunt after another; yet, we aren't invested enough, due to the lack of a cohesive story line."
"Perhaps Bliss would have worked better as a short, as director Mike Cahill's signature use of an open-ended and ambiguous ending will prove frustrating for most."
Starring Jesse Eisenberg as you've only seen him before.
It's so long that by the end you're praying for the sun to set on this a good hour before it finally does.
What should have been an entertaining take on screwball comedy conventions with a likable cast is undermined by cheap laughs.
There are aspects of Elvis that is cinematic mastery and there are other parts that is bilge&#46; It&#8217;s a mess of contradictions as well as being&#8230; just a mess&#46; 
"For an origin story, this felt like a clump of loose ends and square pegs that never fit."
Struggles to maintain tension with dusty soap opera.
"Soul Power leaves you wanting more, and not in a good way."
Any gold in this edition of the franchise is mostly of the fools' variety...a hit-and-miss affair that misses more often than not.
"...despite its rampant sexual material, it is not a sexy film. Dang, this thing couldn't get anything right."
What could have been an incredible political thriller feels more like a good episode of The A-Team.
"The Cave answers every question I've ever had about what might happen when a handful of hotties head deep inside the earth. For starters, the middle-aged and intelligent die early."
"Lola Versus has plenty of potential, but with a script that has absolutely no handle on its lead character, the experience quickly becomes unbearably frustrating."
A bottle of Metamucil holds more meta than this whimper of a movie.
Never achieves any level close to mediocre -- making the film drag on and on.
"I don't know why this movie exists. A completely unoriginal mash-up of every good alien invasion film there's ever been, resulting in an ugly, uninspired, laughably bad mess that'll give you motion sickness while making your ears bleed."
"Unfortunately, for all its superficial entertainment value, Perry-ites won't recognize much of Why Did I Get Married? And in this case, a lack of familiarity just may breed contempt."
Rent-A-Pal is a compelling character study but lacks the oomph and suspense of a traditional thriller.
"Where Parasite had wit and nuance, New Order just has gunshots and screaming."
"Like the plot of the film itself, none of the many bullets that whizz around ever seem to find their targets."
Sin City is nothing but a video game on a big screen without the interactivity.
"It's clear that Queen Latifah is a proper, old school movie star - the camera loves her and her constantly upbeat screen persona is extremely likeable. It's just a shame that studios don't seem able to find a decent vehicle for her talents."
"Without much else beyond its 3-D design going for it, this adventure grows old very fast."
"Gross, annoying, boring, stupid and above all not funny!"
"Never succeeds in being cheesy matinee fun. Worse yet, it doesn't seem to have crossed its gloppy, solemn mind for this to have even been a possibility."
It's an impressive directorial debut that will leave viewers speechless at the end--not necessarily in a good sense.
"Not quite sure where to land between sentiment and broad farce, even as its actors do their valiant best with the well-trod material."
"Christians may shout hallelujah that faith-based films are arriving in theaters, but believers should pray for something much better."
This is one sub that deserves to sink.
"There are many ways to define the shrieking awfulness of The Family Stone, from the general lack of wit to the cheap exploitation of cancer to its casual cruelty."
"Frankly, your children deserve better."
What could have been a good story ends up being poorly executed.
"Crime stories have become incredibly generic, and though this is not a pit like Miami Vice, some bursts of good staging and imagery only serve to remind us that Scorsese is a streak gambler who can get stuck with the wrong hand."
"Disastrously directed by Jane Campion, it is a DOA thriller that, when it should be boiling, can't even warm up to a slow simmer."
"An unconvincing romance, languid pacing and a lot of empty scenes played out specifically for laughs, to the detriment of plot."
"The marketing screwed it over, this is really not much of a horror movie. A PG-13 fantasy at best..."
"A boring, stupid, overlong, obnoxious, soulless piece of Hollywood ""product."""
"It postures and poses, growls and howls, and does very little else."
Sporadically poetic but largely a chore to sit through.
What we have here is a B-grade rendering of the oft-filmed classic.
"Whether in 2D or 3D, it does not have enough of a plot to intrigue or the character development to keep your attention off the clichés, derivative designs and that there is way too much CGI."
"Well, what happened is that one of the smartest Hollywood memoirs of recent times just got made into a rather disappointing film."
"While the parts are quite good, the sum is pretty pedestrian."
The Ringer is caught between a rock and a soft place. The result of being torn between here and there is being stuck nowhere.
"A mopey thriller that unsuccessfully tries to blend psychological portraiture with pointless tension derived from torture, Caland's film wastes two performances that outstrip the material's intelligence deficit."
"Lacking [intellectual interest] and lacking the thrills, ""One Hour Photo"" is more like an underexposed snapshot."
"It is strange seeing De Niro playing a nice, normal old dude and not insane, edgy, enraged and/or emotionally constipated, and you also can't help but think that Meyers' movie would have worked better if he had shot someone."
"The plot doesn't even begin to hold together, and the ultimate reveal of the evil plan makes not a damn lick of sense"
"Casper moves like a dirge, especially when it sinks into a meditation on death a la Ghost. As specter spectacles go, Casper is a bit of a ghost bust."
Scott is more concerned with letting his actors indulge in dramatic onanism than he is with creating suspense.
Reinforces the oft-made argument that sketches that work in quick doses on the small screen can get repellent fast in feature-length format.
"Yeah, it's still a preach-to-the-choir movie, but this choir doesn't really see itself on the big screen very often, so don't begrudge them a film where the action hero cop stops and prays for guidance before big gun battle. It happens."
"It's neither epic enough to fulfill a grand scope, nor intimate enough to be an overpowering emotional experience."
"It's as if someone put the Slenderman meme, the scary girl from The Ring franchise, The Babadook and a few others through a woodchipper and sprayed the resulting mulch on to the screen."
The film is without pace or energy.
The Protégé is not a terrible film. At worst it's just a waste of your time.
I kept wondering how Arcand could have chosen as his generational representative a man not just flawed in his hedonism but one so fundamentally lacking in tenderness for others.
"Schwarzenegger's chief skills are leaning against things, looking confused and having good hair, while Thorne struggles to convincingly lip sync."
Cheesy and very violent adaptation of '90s video game.
"It's self-important, tedious and ultimately pointless."
... a heartfelt but manipulative tearjerker that never digs into the various moral dilemmas at its core with much sincerity or authenticity.
"Despite the pyrotechnics of McAvoy's performances and Willis's grounded conviction, there's just not enough here past the high concept of ""what if real people were superheroes?""..."
Life experience makes me judge them more harshly than do the film's director...I would have preferred not to have spent two hours with either of them.
"Songbird isn't very good, which you might expect for something thrown together so quickly."
"While Ms. Bates can be a nimble scene stealer, decking her out in tattoos and punk jewelry is not enough to spark an uninspired script."
"Dreary family drama goes on to dominate what could almost be described as the plot, and mid-film sorties into a cheerless sex club and a rugby match at an English secondary school are as bamboozling in isolation as they are in context."
"Really, words can't convey how horrible this atrocity is. Nobody involved should ever be allowed near a studio again."
The excitement and fun get bogged down in a story that is too slow to unfold in a failed attempt to make it epic.
This muddled mess about the forces of (what else?) dark and light can barely hold itself together long enough to rip-off far better science fiction movies.
"Unfortunately, this is a film that begs comparison to the television series and because of that draws more criticism than were it to stand alone - although standing along it still insults the intelligence of every moviegoer out there."
"Nicholas Sparks didn't write You're Not You, but he might as well have, given its familiar disease-of-the-week plot filled with scenic locations and gorgeous people."
"Generation X has never appeared so needy, so narcissistic, or so ficticiously broad."
"This Special Jury Prize winner at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival has its doubts, rather too tentatively expressed, and its arguments might have been bolstered by considering the recent history of all the other architecture in the killing fields..."
"Anna ends up singing ""hello darkness, I'm ready to succumb"" and ""this grief has a gravity, it pulls me down."" Like much of the rest of the film, it's a bummer."
"Your brain, and, yes, your soul, long for ... a film that walked either the straight and narrow path of righteousness or blazed some new trail instead of frustratingly sticking with such faith and fervor to the middle of the road."
"The pleasures of watching the action-movie past getting one more shot at silver-screen glory is undeniable, but like its predecessor, The Expendables 2 is a better concept than it is a movie."
"Mediocre, but watchable."
Finally the gross exploitation picture that detractors have accused the Farrellys of perpetrating throughout their career.
"Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine finds the almost-80-year-old filmmaker in fine form as a director of actors, but he undermines that skill with a terribly structured and under-thought screenplay."
"The film is so artificial that it feels like a mockumentary (i.e. a deranged black comedy), and marks a low point in the career of De Palma."
"Even if the saccharin level is raised to gargantuan heights, the diving scenes are exciting, right? Wrong."
"If in ten years we look back on it and think, ""Yep, they got it right,"" we'll really be screwed. We'll probably still think the movie isn't very good, though."
"Just as Let The Right One In gave the vampire genre a Nordic Noir makeover, Thelma has done the same with the superhero genre, but with much less success."
"Zellweger frequently seems awkward in Bridget Jones' skin this time around, as if lacking direction for the character's development from me me me to mama."
"Where Shanghai should teem, it merely ambles."
The interactions of the two leads are like a finger hitting a single piano note for 90 minutes.
"This all plays out pleasantly, predictably, unmemorably, but what do I know? I'm a guy. My mind was probably elsewhere."
"Connery was very good in this role, and his presence is the reason why The Rock doesn't suck as bad as it could have."
"As common wisdom says, you can't make a cult classic on purpose."
"It might have been fun, but it's condescending and stupidly mean-spirited instead."
it's sad to see [Martin] in a film that offers little other than stupid accents and broad pratfalls
"It may think it's above such teen angst drivel, but I Am Number Four is just more of the same -- only with aliens."
Everything about Superintelligence seems aimed at being as insipid and forgettable as possible.
By now you've seen most of the visual gags. A bus drives into a building. An outhouse explodes.
"Ku photographs almost everything in intrusive close-up, with a shaky hand-held camera - an increasingly hackneyed way of conveying documentary-style reality."
"It takes no risks, so it leads nowhere."
"Despite its undeniable thematic richness, 'Legacy' marks a slight return for Georgian director Gla Babluani."
A cross between Hitchcock at low ebb and a State Department white paper. Thrilling it's not.
"Just Wright tries to soften everybody's rough edges by the end, to an extent that defies dramatic logic."
A made-to-order cult item.
Earnest but misguided attempt to generate political allegory from the horrific Mountain Meadows Massacre of 9/11/1857 would have benefited from a more straightforward retelling.
"Earns its stripes as one of those bad movies that's so bad it's good, in its bad way."
"Eat Pray Love is overlong and quickly becomes tedious. It features narcissistic, inward looking characters of no interest at all and amounts to a very poorly made film."
The inspiring true story soon suffers respiratory failure.
"But The Human Resources Manager is not really about guest workers-instead, like the Magical Negroes so beloved of certain American filmmakers, they exist only to help members of the privileged classes get in touch with their humanity"
"No matter how adeptly Chainsaw 2 was put together, it would remain just another exploitation flick for fans who get a tingle from watching blades slash into flesh and innards peep out."
Compounding the action's lack of originality are both the amateurishness of every performance and the wobbly-camera aesthetics.
...M. Knight Shyamalan trapped in a pornorgraphic art flick.
Freedomland is a drama that plays like an episode of a TV cop show stretched beyond its limits.
"Conversations ramble on, ideas are tossed around, and the movie keeps hammering home its metaphor, which is that couples should avoid digging too deeply into scary holes. It's all very whatever, and that isn't enough."
The Answer Man is one of those modestly diverting motion pictures that's as sweet as cotton candy -- and as insubstantial.
A TV pilot disguised as a movie. 
"For all that Bridge to Terabithia does to encourage children to exercise their imaginations and pursue the arts, the movie's producers give only glimpses of the wonderful creatures and magical kingdom dreamed up by two children."
"Rockwell's certainly up for the challenge of playing multiple roles, but ultimately, he's just yammering to himself. This movie has half an idea and, and the end, tries to convince you it had seven."
"Scot Armstrong, one of the writers of The Hangover Part II, makes his directorial debut with a film that borrows large chunks of the plot from The Hangover part one."
What made Frankie run? The movie clearly doesn't know.
"While most of Rosenstrasse is set in World War II, there are present-day, flash-forward sequences that are considerably less involving. Actually, they're so dull that they drag the entire movie to a screeching halt."
"Clawing away under its 3D dinge and slick but desensitising effects, the movie is deadly, even when it's cool - a comic-book adaptation ruthlessly shorn of the word ""comic""."
Not reporting a man stuck in your windshield because you realize you were wasted: logical. Not believing it was your fault: priceless.
"""Delicacy"" has some clever visual ideas and I admire its refusal to bend to the conventions of romantic comedies, but there's a problem with the co-worker flirtation: We don't care."
"an excruciatingly slow, uninvolving, story of a bunch of imaginary people about which I cared not a whit...a disappointing job of recreating the Cocoanut Grove; how much could a couple of fake palm trees cost?"
"It tries to do a lot, but ultimately doesn't do enough."
"Director Scott is, as usual, way more into blowing stuff up than a moral cat-and-mouse game. Any hint of depth sends him zooming into yet another flashily pointless 'woo woo' motorbike chase, destroying the masterful two-hander tension."
"Frank and Lola ultimately feels like less of a compelling, free-standing work than a promise of better movies to come."
"While defending the consistency of Tati's vision as a humorist, it has to be admitted that Traffic is a fitful and disappointing successor to Playtime."
"Outside of the moments of kinetic madness that represent the action sequences, this movie is an amalgamation of lame comedy, campy Eastern mysticism, and dumb plotting."
One has to wonder what Donner really had in mind with this picture. It doesn't say anything serious about child abuse. It doesn't search for any serious answers.
"This story chooses to play it safe with the style and how deep it dives into the lore. Night Teeth features good chemistry between the main trio, but their journey is a bit too conventional."
"Watching the dead-eyed population of Polar Express and their supposedly 'natural' movements made me think more of Gollum in ""The Lord of the Rings"" than anything associated with Christmas."
"The 40-minute setup is deliciously nutty, with eccentric turns from Walken and Spacek. But the longer Adam remains above ground, the more plodding and predictable the scenario becomes."
Monty Lapica's film about the self-destructive behavior of a 17-year-old suffers from severe dramatic droop.
The Princess Diaries can be quickly summed up as a series of bland vignettes about a 15 year-old girl's makeover as if directed by an 80 year old man.
"Unfortunately all the metafictional layering only highlights the lack of engagement at the center of the story, the three stars acting up a storm but barely acknowledging each other."
Lobs nothing but clichés.
It's just tricky to try to make something look convincingly state-of-the-art and gloriously cheesy at the same time... What's missing is the fleeting but genuine awe that Gareth Edwards conjured up in Godzilla...
"The gimmick-machinery whirrs, but the human beings in it can't breath"
"My heartiest laugh came at the very beginning when a volcano erupts, and a bird atop a cliff watching the whole event suddenly dons a pair of sunglasses. Why couldn't there have been more of that type of silly, but funny, humor?"
"Szumowska provides lurid scenes of perverted sex, but she offers no new insight into the sordid world of prostitution and the dangers sex workers face."
"Attempts at detailed characterization don't work particularly well, and there's a love story that feels as forced as it is superfluous - although even that isn't as unnecessary as the film's final ten minutes."
"A bruising US history class, taught in Dolby Surround."
"Owen tries with lurching uncertainty to ease back into normal, even as the writer and director Sara Colangelo clutters his path with enough obstacles to challenge the most heroically determined traveler."
One more reminder that kids are better off with a book than a middling movie adaptation of a book.
"Paulson will be fine after this misstep. Ditto Allen, who could not be a more appealing lead or a resourceful damsel-in-distress."
"Well, at least we still have ""Upgrade""."
"The film could have been an excellent introduction to a relatively unknown historical figure, but it doesn't eloquently capture the essence of their real life struggle."
"A long, snarky, borderline disdainful parody that's also an inferior imitation of the movies it mocks. No, thank you."
"They're all working against the handicap of Denis' ponderously philosophical script, which has more black holes than the universe."
Too dull and mediocre to be interesting or interestingly bad.
"...if I didn't already enjoy the composer's music, this movie would never have swayed to like it."
Little more than a timeline doodle instead of a deep and meaningful portrait.
"As a homage to slasher movies of the sixties and seventies [it] works fairly well. But as a horror movie in the broader sense, it's a fairly tame, sluggish affair, despite a few moments whose ickiness will cause you to blanch."
"Although the picture consumes only 90 minutes, it somehow seems draggy, for the reason that everything other than the scenes with the three principals seems extraneous and tends to clog the progression of the tale."
"The Caller is a loopy, talky, 92-minute two-hander with Elliott Gould and Frank Langella (on a downward spiral following his juicy triumph in Frost/Nixon), written and directed by a force to forget called Richard Ledes."
"There's so much more possible than what's being offered here. In that sense, The Astronaut Farmer doesn't aim or dream nearly high enough."
How did Kevin Smith gain any fan base? This clunker made a bundle.
"While I can certainly marvel at the realistic computerized water in a movie, I don't go to the movies to marvel at computerized water."
"Although not the misfire it could have been, Arcel's treatment of The Dark Tower is perhaps more sacrilegious than an utterly tone-deaf train wreck because, to be blunt, it's boring."
"A farce that doesn't use, say, The Lady Eve, The 40-Year-Old Virgin or even Carry On Camping as its benchmarks, instead only hoping to out-funny the pictures of Andrei Tarkovsky, that video Werner Herzog won't let us see, and the concept of famine."
"""Inherent Vice,"" meandering even by Anderson's standards, is easily the worst of his movies, a soporific 2 /&#8322;- hour endurance test."
A stale Euro-pudding.
"In the movie and in their own lives, [these characters are] the problem."
Rarely have I seen the volcanic Jackson look so disinterested; this is the closest he's ever come to phoning it in.
Just don't look for depth or incision in this movie version of Emma.
"It ain't rubbish, but Affleck's fly-by-night operation is still one to avoid."
"La despedida de Robert Altman no está entre lo mejor de su obra, pero es una cálida evocación de tiempos y ritos pasados animada por un atractivo elenco."
The villains are overwrought and the design of Mars is surprisingly bland.
Uncharted delivers stale execution of a thrilling video game franchise...the originally charismatic duo of Nathan Drake and Sully become wooden action heroes that aren't able to soar like their video game counterparts.
"If you promise us Angelina Jolie fighting fires in the first act, that promise had better go off in the third. And it doesn't."
[I]t's just something none of [the stars] deserve.
The filmmakers take the story so seriously Reign of Fire becomes the dullest movie imaginable about fire-breathing lizards. It's Godzilla written by Strindberg.
"Reconfirms that most entries in the ""found-footage"" horror subgenre should remain lost."
"Unfortunately, the picture failed to capture me. I found it slow, drab, and bordering on melodramatic."
Michael Haneke's run of making increasingly better films has come to an abrupt halt.
"""Cherry"" has the glossy inauthenticity of a bad Tony Scott movie."
"Instead of producing an inflammatory piece of agitprop, Paine's film is more like an especially edgy Saturn commercial."
"Nothing is plausible, and no one is likable. It does not build or flow; it lurches. It isn't funny, because it isn't believable. This isn't entertainment. This is an irritant."
The movie &#46;&#46;&#46; ostensibly tells Brown&apos;s story&#44; but it seems strangely reluctant to see that story through the man&apos;s own eyes&#46;
"As grim, grisly and gratuitous as the original movie, this remake serves about as little purpose."

Is pretty thin and uninspired outside of one or two modestly clever gags.
Disney's recent trend of remaking their own movies is a cash grab because audiences know this. The problem is they're becoming terrible at hiding it and the proof is within Dumbo itself.

Screenwriter Matt Harris' overreliance on whimsy and a seemingly desperate need to tug at our hearts - instead of our minds - undercuts the film's more valid situations and sentiments.
"Thirteen is all about maintaining a barely perceptible smirk behind an impassive pose. The line between cool and cold is a thin one, however. Cool isn't the word for Thirteen; it's just smug."

"Ultimately feels like those sous-vide bags that Adam finds so worthy of mockery: trapped in plastic, with the air sucked out of it."
"None of the characters in Life Itself are interesting on their own, so Fogelman attempts to gin them up some fake pathos through death, either theirs or someone near them."

"An ugly, joyless horror movie that deserves to be tossed into the business end of 1988's ""Woodchipper Massacre."""

If only the movie that encases this character were as sharp and distinctive as Harriet.
"In the more than 25 years since the bracing brashness of Roger & Me, why are Moore's documentary-making skills and aesthetic interests stuck with such an exasperating case of arrested development?"
"This is a remake of an early-'70s British flick of the same name starring Michael Caine, a great movie that reeked of despair and emptiness. This one is just damp and mildewy."
"Call it a Shakespearean catharsis or just call it a lark -- either way, the movie represents Whedon's least essential work, regardless of the material's inherent comedic inspiration."
"McDonagh has enough ideas for six films, but with them all crammed into one, the effect of each is lost."

"A competent but hardly rousing piece of effects-spectacle entertainment in which Sam Worthington exudes the yep-I'm-here charisma of a middleweight Steve Reeves stand-in. Terrible 3-D, too."

"I'd hate to think that a machine could ever replace a film critic, but I'd be curious to know what Chappie would think of Chappie. So much about the film doesn't compute."

"Is it just me, or are the CGI critters multiplying at an astounding rate?"
Inoffensive and unremarkable.
It's got a couple of clever ideas. I thought the animation was uninspired and it's kind of forgettable.

"A classic turkey, the kind of movie you'll look back on at the end of the year and realize you've forgotten about entirely."
"Very stylish, nice to look at, but a good cast and good director, doesn't always mean it's a good movie. It doesn't draw you in and make you want to stay through the end."

"Undone by its best intentions, I Am Sam is an especially insipid example of the Hollywood message movie."
"The sweeping landscapes look flawless, but missing from Local Color's canvas is any nuance in its human elements."
"Oddly wanting to be a Western at times (only with tanks, machine guns and lots of bloody and burning corpses), it's full of iffy racial profiling, simplistic politics, soapbox speeches and distortions of the truth."
"The Matrix Resurrections is a top-to-bottom mess and reveals no reasons for it to exist aside from familiar characters getting to say things like ""bullet time"" and ""red pill/blue pill"" again."
The only snorts it warrants are of the disdainful variety&#46;
"Whatever else you may think of Boll's directorial 'skills,' you can't fault him for inconsistency -- his movies are always atrocious, and Bloodrayne is no exception."

"Um, not a movie to see with the parents."
"When the film is trying to be scary -- which is most of the time -- it's not particularly successful. Indeed, its clumsiness in that respect is such that it's downright laughable. It's occasionally redeemed, however, when it's being deliberately funny."

"Spears may find her way as an actress, but Crossroads leads to a dead end."
"Bright Lights, Big City is no worse than most movies that present a selfindulgent, self-pitying WASP male view of the world."
"An action sequence isn't just about spectacular visions but about making audiences care about those visuals, about what they mean for the characters. There, Superman Returns comes up short."

The lack of consequences for Mat's deviance snowballs into a frustrating mess made more excruciating by a pulsing string quartet score and the trite cocktail party observations of the supporting cast.
"If there's a reason to watch The Lodge, it's Keough, who resists the urge to go Full Collette in her depiction of spiraling despair. It's a controlled performance in a film that tries its very best to push her into hysteria."
"Hardly entertaining for kids, even less so for adults. [Full review in Spanish]"
"In Ellroy's original scenario Street Kings was a period piece, set in the 1990s just after the Rodney King riots. I wonder if it would've made more sense that way."
"Makes a person grateful for the excess smog in LA, if only due to the fact that the individuals behind this picture may not be healthy enough to produce another sequel."
The baseball action isn't very interesting because the angels (led by Christopher Lloyd) manipulate the outcomes. And the human interest stuff is canned and unconvincing.
"A lengthy drinking binge of a movie: It's fun for a while, seems to offer more meaning than it actually does - and leaves you wishing it hadn't ended so badly."
"You know how this ends, right? Of course you know how this ends. So the point of the film isn't the foregone conclusion, but the journey, which is... bland."
"Zeitlin gets a little too precious when it comes to emphasizing the bliss and freedom of childhood, with far too much of the movie focused on the kids running around and screaming, or treading water."
Can only ride on our nostalgia for too long before the audience decides it's a tiresome and often confusing mess...
Here's hoping X-Men: Days of Future Past can restore Singer to his former glory - it's become easy to forget that he was essentially the JJ Abrams of the noughties - because this dim-witted action fable isn't going to cut it.
"All the actors are sunk by playing caricatures prone to spitting out leaden, often unintentionally humorous dialogue."
A commercial for Legos.
An initially gripping parable about workers' rights in a Portuguese lift factory gradually becomes a harrowing endurance test
"Frenetic, visually overstuffed fantasy sequel has precious little to do with Lewis Carroll, but international audiences will likely succumb to the spectacle."
It may feature startling subject matter in bold&#44; sobering&#44; momentarily eye-opening methods &#8211; but the entertainment value is incredibly limited&#46;
"The stars above, and beneath, the fiery eyes of Daisy Ridley, the sole beacon, with promise of a story with emotional investment and volcanic result. J. J. Abrams betrays Daisy Ridley's eyes."
"No better than moderately amusing, like a decent but forgettable network sitcom."
Tommy Lee Jones and five cheerleaders; Vin Diesel and five toddlers. What's next? Harrison Ford and five crazy out of control nursing home patients?
"""Think Like a Man"" becomes as tedious as ""Valentine's Day,"" a movie based on a holiday, or ""He's Just Not That Into You,"" a movie based on putdowns disguised as advice."
The genre tropes are all alive and well and Scary Stories delivers them with élan but the dispiriting ending hangs over everything like a pall.
Even MacLachlan's surprisingly witty performance can't compensate for the trite screenplay and Mistry's lack of charisma.
"It's not the message in Religulous that's a turn-off, but the way in which it's delivered."
There's little here for accompanying parents or older siblings. And the film never does figure out what the smurfing point of Smurfette is.
So awful as to make heterosexual men actively loathe Playboy.
"Creepshow offers a few jolts to the respiratory system and a few kicks in the funnybone, but it never begins to build or satisfy in any grown-up way. "
"Feels like nothing quite so much as a middle-aged moviemaker's attempt to surround himself with beautiful, half-naked women."
"Despite the heartfelt performances, especially by Revathy (who plays Laila's feisty mother), the film strikes many a false note."
It's easy to see from the above that The Last Kiss is a movie scripted from a male point of view to capture that elusive young male demographic.
Fairly forgettable.
"Takes enough interesting turns and twists to earn and keep your attention, all before an ending that sacrifices credibility for the sake of convenience."
"Prostitution in polite society is still a nettle fearfully grasped. You see, society is not polite and it's about time movies stopped peddling that fluff."
Don&#8217;t Worry Darling is like a Twilight Zone episode pushed to the outer limits of its dramatic sustainability&#46; It takes 122 minutes to do what Rod Serling would have in a cool 25&#46;
"Creativity is a stranger to this sick excuse for entertainment, which pounds a ridiculous back story into a butchered rehash that includes incest, cannibalism, eyeball gouging and impossibly dumb plot contrivances."
"[A] disposable period piece, a gallery of pretty pictures in search of a personality of its own."
"You need two chalices, one with a mermaid's tear in it, which is the one that allows you to drain the years from OH CAN WE JUST SEE PENELOPE CRUZ'S BOOBS ALREADY?."
"Regardless of the well filled-out cast and the fact that it's structured like a comedy, Adventureland just isn't funny. There really aren't jokes and the overlong running time is mostly given to a standard budding romance."
A mediocre Chris Rock vehicle.
"The film is over-long, plot heavy, needlessly complicated and lacklustre, but the moments of dance and music keep it from being a total waste of time."
"Zodiac is all about Fincher's personal enthusiasms and obsessions. It takes a mighty big ego to steal the show from a serial killer. Apparently, Fincher's just the guy for the job."
"In ""Somewhere,"" what ends up happening is that the main character's lack of interest becomes the audience's burden."
"Over the course of a pressing-it two hours, we learn some deep, dark secrets that aren't that deep if you've seen a lot of movies."
Follows the usual formula for these Crosby-Hope road movies.
The final bell couldn't come fast enough.
Most of the movie is spent watching Jack Gyllenhaal shiver ominously next to Steve Urkel.
All good intentions come to naught with a messy narrative and garish visuals in Ugly Dolls.
"I sat there, watching and thinking, ""there are so many good things in this, yet none of them are touching me in the slightest."" I was bored, and that's almost the most damning thing. Considerably less than the sum of its parts."
"By the end of the film this fascinating character study looses all credibility at the hands of an age-old, Hollywood stereotype."
"Ross and Elliott deliver the kind of wooden, stilted performances necessitated and even demanded by the material."
"What ""The Strange Color"" lacks is the heart that separates a good film from a great one."
The cumulative effect ... is numbing.
Nicholas Sparks strikes again with yet another film based on a misty-eyed novel about tormented seaside romance in the romanticised American South.
"Heaps of plot devices, Washington's ridiculously cool fight scenes and Pattinson looking in a suit like a hunk that just won't quit only mildly distracts from the over-complicated and nonsensical world of Tenet."
Part heist scenario&#44; part hostage yarn&#44; part cop drama&#44; all of these elements feel halfhearted and eye-rollingly familiar thanks to a messy script&#46;
"Green Book lacks the depth it aspires to, and only works on a very superficial level. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali give exceptional performances but this message movie fumbles its message."
"It's no surprise this is terrible, considering it's not much of a step down from the original."
"Even with a great cast and a great story idea, the movie fails to build even a hint of suspense."
Never rises above being merely skin-deep.
"...culminating with a recreation of a charitable gig from the 1980s, the movie resembles Bohemian Rhapsody. Unfortunately, it resembles that movie in all the other ways too."
"Points for effort, but Tesla is ultimately a puzzling curiosity of a movie."
"What we have here isn't a movie, it's a coffee-table book."
Kickin' It Old Skool equates making incalculable 80s pop culture references with joke telling.
"Roland Emmerich destroys the world again with Moonfall, but this time his heart just isnt in it."
"It ambles along pleasantly, produces a few chuckles, and is forgotten by the time you pass the popcorn counter on the way out of the theater."
The Wolf House undoubtedly has sharp and fascinating pints to make... But those messages get lost in a slow-moving avalanche of undeniably impressive images that never quite touch the emotions in the way they are meant.
Another kooky and over-baked visually spectacular film filled with lavish costumes and spooky goth style from director Tim Burton.
"Uneven but not entirely enjoyable, even if it only truly works when acting as a retread of films you'd rather be watching instead."
Slow to gather momentum and generates little excitement or tension.
"Among the so many other things I don't understand lately is why they're opening this one ""in theaters only""."
"An insipid script by Laws of Attraction co-writer Aline Brosh McKenna packs a few droll one-liners, but mostly the film only aspires to its chick-lit roots."
Rob Marshall has neither the personal touch to connect to his main character nor the foresight to realize that a dreamlike cinematic musical about the cinema may not be best served on a damn soundstage.
I didn’t laugh once in this movie. A shadow of the memory of the rumor of a smile never once threatened to appear on my face. 
"'Halloween 5: The Failure of Michael Myers' would be more accurate, though admittedly not as appealing in a mass-marketing sense."
"A noteworthy mess for the sheer mass of talent it squanders, Catch and Release is best not caught."
Oozes condescension from every pore.
The crude humor and over-the-top language sabotage what could have been a very funny movie.
"The maudlin, grotesque western September Dawn apes Schindler's List in hopes of creatinga Christian Holocaust picture."
"There isn't a single word in the English language that could justly convey the sheer stupidity, and impenetrable complexity, of Push."
Crosses the worst of Tyler Perry's 'old-fashioned values' preachiness (minus the religious stuff) with the leering crudity of the standard Martin Lawrence vehicle.
"Despite strong performances, sharp filmmaking, and plentiful discomfort, it doesn't amount to much beyond a fairly quiet look at a family imploding."
...the inside-baseball approach to the material prevents one from embracing the characters and ensuring that certain sequences come off as dry and incomprehensible
"Why Did I Get Married? is Tyler Perry's best screen effort to date, which is to say it's comfortably mediocre instead of criminally intolerable."
The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is so knowing and so arch: the first part striving for a faux-grandiosity that the second part tries to undercut by its pseudo-geekiness... but ends up being plain annoying.
So much thrown at you with so little character reaction that it feels more like fanfiction.
"Certainly not terrible, but ultimately forgettable and that means you should skip it."
There are certain varieties of whimsy that either click with you or don&#8217;t&#46;
"Stale, raunchy buddy comedy has tons of partying, sex talk."
This music-heavy period piece is so dour that it's a bit of a drag.
Campy and creepy - it's sinister but not scary enough.
I don't know whether this remake is faithful. Did the original include a scene in which the leading man puts on a bear costume in an effort to infiltrate cultists?
"By bantering with the lads and slapping their wrists at the same, War Dogs is left with countless rounds of illicit ammo and no clear satirical target."
"Whatever else Stiller is, he's not a ""kid"", and his behaviour as a 40-year-old looks even more ludicrous than Charles Grodin's did in the original."
"I have yet to see writer Michael Cooney's prior claims to fame, his Jack Frost flicks, but I'm assuming that they're better than this one."
It might be one of the most cloying and aggressively irritating films that I have ever been subjected to.
"'What do you think this is, some kind of 1930s movie?' Mary bellows at her mother at one point. If only it were."
"Viscerally effective but intellectually indefensible... By adding jejune socio-economic commentary to the mix, [it] pretends to be making a point about inequality in America while still just appealing to the audience's vicarious bloodlust."
The Men Who Stare at Goats is a handful of hilarious scenes looking for a movie.
"Instead of wanting to make us think, and shiver at the 'what if' potential, it wants us to worry what happens when Mommy goes down into the basement."
"The Losers -- co-written by Peter Berg, who made the similarly loud and out-of-control The Kingdom -- makes a whole lot of noise without making a great deal of sense."
"Dune is the most visually arresting, well-cast film of the year. Sadly, it also plods and meanders along until it reaches its overwrought conclusion."
"If the first film was a classic designer outfit, this is the cheap knockoff that falls apart as soon as you put it on."
The plot of Matrix 4 is essentially that conversation with the guy who's way too stoned who has this great idea for a Matrix sequel.
"It's the kind of thriller about violent turf wars, corruption, and sex trafficking that's rated PG-13, in case some 11-year-olds want to see it unaccompanied."
"Nothing particularly original or fresh has been injected into this competently made, violent but uningratiating remake of the star-studded John Sturges Western, which itself was a redo of Akira Kurosawa's imperishable 1954 classic, Seven Samurai."
"This self-financed flick's shortcomings go way beyond the standard array of glaring continuity errors, dodgy sets and stagnant editing."
"The film is tasked with cramming an entire life into the minimum of time, and it often comes up short when it comes to canny explorations and richer examinations of both Joplin's individual life and her greater legacy."
The latest in the continuing saga of Sylvester Stallone's mission to provide a work week or two to as many of his old pals as possible.
it's embarrassing in a way that makes you want to avert your eyes and back slowly out of the theater
This 'thriller' is more likely to lull viewers to sleep than to keep them on the edges of their seats.
"If you know someone you really can't stand - not someone you dislike, not someone who rubs you the wrong way, but someone you really loathe and detest - send that person a ticket for ""Suicide Squad."""
After preliminary special-effects high jinks -- wolves bobsledding a hollow log down a twisty mountain run -- Alpha and Omega kicks into An Important Life Lesson.
Ultimately each move toward breaking a barrier or assaulting a taboo is undercut by a reliance on conformity and convention.
"In the moment, You Kill Me is never less than mildly entertaining, and it's almost never more than that."
"A bewildering slice of southern gothic hokum, it suffers from a weak script, proving that old saw about actors being only as good as the lines they're given."
"After the resonant and lyrical experience of Sissako's criminally unseen Waiting for Happiness, which could have been an alternate title for Bamako, this new film represents a colossal downgrade."
"Darkness fell along with my eyelids, during this dire by-the-numbers horror film."
"It is such a botch that it is difficult to believe that any of those involved with its production actually saw the original ""Elizabeth,"" let alone helped make it."
"Small fry will learn an important lesson taking in the recycled storylines of ""Ratchet & Clank"": Like nearly all recycling, it's garbage."
Slight and tonally awkward. I wasn't expecting Josh Harnett (of all people) to pop up in a Japanese movie.
Pretty much meets egg-spectations of an absurd bird game plucked from an app and served up on the big screen.
Kasdan and company miss the opportunity to connect Elizabeth's venality to the greed and materialism that her pop consumer students absorb daily.
"Doesn't always distinguish between fact and fiction, about an interesting social and artistic experiment."
"The big question here is why any of ""The Voices,"" as crisply made and stylish as it is, should matter or entertain. The cold truth is that it doesn't."
"Continues to demonstrate good intentions but virtually nonexistent abilities, tackling an important but hardly new issue in irresponsible fashion."
"Just remember kids: as fun as it all seems, fast food, soda, candy, binge drinking, reckless driving, steroids, dirty ball and, well, yes, Adam Sandler movies are bad for you."
"The second Anchorman movie will remind you how much you liked the first movie. Until, eventually, you forget."
"Ava DuVernay is great, and she brings a lot to the table...this is visually stunning sometimes, but sometimes it's also horrible looking...I don't think it worked."
"By positioning 'New Mutants' as a start to a larger story, the whole things feels unfinished and ultimately unnecessary."
"It's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable, and Shiner, starring Michael Caine as an aging British boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune, is certainly that."
"The entire experience is shameful -- for us, for the filmmakers, for whoever at the studio had the job of creating the ads, in which the cast appear to be starring in hostage posters."
"This is a film with some excruciatingly wooden acting – though not by Gallo, whose presence makes every scene he’s in about seven times more interesting."
"The very concept of the movie was fraught from the outset. The film addresses the problem that these are the kinds of questions only asked of moms who are astronauts, not fathers, and yet they've based a whole movie on it."
This movie stars exactly one paleface American and several paler-faced Brits in almost all the supporting roles. The bronzer budget must have been a major line item.
Business-as-usual for a sports movie.
"As history, it seems a fairly accurate account of what happened, although it never much bothers its head about why. As film art, it is nothing less than a $25-million irrelevancy."
Frantic and noisy -- and almost unrelated to the book -- but genuinely fun in spots.
"This second-rate Jacques Demy homage crisscrosses multiple continents, nationalities, generations, decades and some key historic events in a helter-skelter romantic musical as odd as it is confusing and corny."
"Like the Puritans themselves, the movie shuns drama. It has too much moral virtue for jump scares."
"With a little more refinement, ""The Public"" might have been the kind of memorable movie it clearly aspires to be."
"The biggest question the movie leaves us with, is how did Faye Dunaway get roped into doing the film?"
"an Eddie Murphy vehicle through and through, with little holding it together outside of the familiar cadences of his streetwise confidence and infectious laugh"
"For all its attempts at bending the rules, Aberdeen still comes off as frustratingly conventional."
"A visual feast, but a spiritual famine."
"Too many silly made-up words like ""Underverse"" and ""Furyan"" can really kill a serious atmosphere, and some of the CG stuff shows rough edges."
Watching the stars try to out-cutesy the mutt is one for the puke bucket.
"Hathaway at times seems lost, unable to single-handedly conjure the suspicion and paranoia bubbling in the plot; Dafoe opts to chew scenery; Affleck is a non-entity."
"It falls ignominiously on its fat one. The Sony hackers, the so-called Guardians of Peace, have leaked the new Annie online so everyone can have free access. It's their cruelest trick to date."
A historical drama that simply fails to make convincing human connections.
"For an 'adventure movie' full of quirk, King of California can feel a bit flat."
"The clichs and plot devices are all so old hat, and the concept is so confusing and nonsensical..."
"The melodrama has a well-intentioned mise-en-scène that reflects the early aesthetic concerns of the Swedish master, but the psychological well of his proposal lacks emotional resonance. Full review in Spanish"
"Perhaps Nighy's enough to recommend the feature, but as period pulp with iffy twists and turns, ""The Limehouse Golem"" doesn't disturb, limping to a conclusion."
"In the contest between last spring's 'Mirror Mirror' and this pic, who's the fairest of them all? Turns out it's a tie ... flat versus ponderous, they're both rife with rotten apples."
"Barring one funny 911 call, it's awful."
What was likely meant to be the series' greatest hits feels more like a cover band going through the motions of a formerly engaging franchise.
Garry Marshall's romantic comedy delivers plenty of wish fulfillment without managing to offer anything remotely fulfilling.
"There are plenty of belly laughs to be had, but the flawless cast is hampered by bad pacing and a haphazard storyline in which things seem to happen for no discernable reason."
Some provocative ideas are left unfulfilled in this visually dazzling indictment of Hollywood and technology.
This is lazy and wholly undeserving of the audience it cynically seeks.
"Judging from the box-office success of 2010's Grown Ups, there is a healthy-sized audience for this brand of comedy."
"How does this movie fail? Count the ways. It's badly written, ineptly directed and it sets Paris Hilton as the pinnacle of female beauty and desirability."
"Though a problem with this reboot--and perhaps this will stem from expectations--is that one doesn't come away really wowed by the world or understanding how it spawned such a vast multimedia empire of games, movies, and comics."
Bad timing is merely one of this rom-com's lesser problems; the abundance of wasted talent on display is an even bigger concern.
Sonic the Hedgehog takes Sega's standard bearer for the concept of cool and commits the unthinkable. Sonic is boring.
"It's a movie that scrounges so desperately for laughs, it features both a flatulent moose and a flatulent train."
"Some elements of the story are a little silly - though I love Famke Janssen's portrayal of Xenia Onatopp, her psychopathic, nymphomaniac pathology is slightly comical."
It's really several Lassie episodes (without the collie) braided together to make one full-length picture.
At times &quot;The Invitation&quot; feels like someone wrote&#44; &quot;what if Prince Harry was a vampire&quot; on a whiteboard and called it a day&#46;
"From start to finish, this sub-par goof-fest is cobbled together from second-hand ideas and third-rate gags."
"It's not entirely Thomas's fault: What are you going to do with those fat-cheeked, helium-voiced singing critters but slap together enough ""awwww"" moments to make the toddlers happy and enough knowing winks to keep parental bums in the seats?"
This movie was in some ways like Mulan meets Alien Dinosaurs.
"There comes a point where the melodramatic idyll wears me out, despite the excellent performances from Blanchett and Mara. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Much of this footage might have been illuminating, even fascinating, in 2003. But seven years on, it's ancient history lacking insight, hindsight or a fresh take."
"The actors try hard, but the mercilessly derivative, emotionally pat script stifles their efforts at every corner."
"It's four wacky holiday comedies in one movie, each trying to top the last."
The film never really works as profile or provocation.
"Terrible messages about relationships. Ed Burns is a mysoginist. But some laughs, could be worse."
I forgot to mention in the body of my review that Tig Notaro is the only thing good in the movie&#44; so I will make that statement in this here pull quote&#46; The rest of the movie is a tedious journey into Hell&#46;
"""Secret in Their Eyes"" never quite captures the intensity of the film it is based upon, making it a fairly standard thriller."
Reappraisal is not due.
"It could have used the hand of a rewrite, but visually and performatively, it is frequently arresting"
"No matter how sweet and good-looking and likeable they may be, the bottom line remains: You know what's going to happen from the very beginning."
"Allen's old-school humor can be refreshing in this era of the-grosser-the-better. The problem is that, at least in Anything Else, it often isn't funny."
"Detest may not be a strong enough word to express what surely ranks as the worst movie of 2010. If you choose to ignore this warning, you may want to jump off a cliff after seeing this debacle for yourself"
"Bradford spends the entire film with an Andrew Shue-ish sullen, slack-jawed expression, but even that's more than what the bland Appleby brings to her doormat role."
"Owen and Seyfried never get airborne, neither seeming invested or energised by the material. You don't blame them."
"For starters, it's just plain goofy."
"The 1978 version was funny (Donald Sutherland's jokes, Jeff Goldblum's Jeff Goldblum-ness), spooky and unpredictable, with likable characters. This one is just as clinical as a pod person."
"To give a passing grade to this sloppy, one-note, scatologically obsessed trifle is to propose that the lowest common denominator of entertainment is an altitude hovering thousands of feet above the peak of Mount Everest."
Are old white guys trying to act like young black girls still funny? Whoever keeps writing these kinds of scripts really needs to be hurt (or at least forced to stand naked holding up a sign in NYC with their script scrawled on the front).
"The out-of-order sequencing adds little in terms of thematic structure, and thwarts all attempts to get swept up in the film's narrative flow."
simplified and predictable plot that uses every pseudo-religious cliche imaginable
A laugh-deprived misadventure.
"Despite several strong scenes and moments, the film feels like a desperate attempt to justify its own existence."
"""Annette"" is mentally and physically debilitating to watch."
"With more swagger than Saint Pat on Snake Day, Edward Burns struts around 1983 Hell's Kitchen in search of a Sopranos audition."
To say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor.
"Everyone in this picture takes himself or herself far too seriously as if to prove that if you don't crack a smile or burst into laughter at the silliness of the plot, you must be a darn good actor."
American Murderer should make Brown someone to root for&#8212;given the story&#8217;s outcome&#8212;but Gentile seems to go at it in a backhanded fashion or miss that point completely&#46; 
...the movie isn't half as diabolical as its marketing plan.
"What's the motivation for the earnest, handsome, well-acted, unenlightening, workaday J. Edgar in 2011?"
"It's too common to complain that a book is better than the movie. But in A Slipping-Down Life, the score trumps what's on screen as well."
"Loaded with obtuse symbolism, the film is not only hard to understand, it isn't much fun trying to figure it out."
"While Yoga Hosers continues Smith's quest to push himself into increasingly strange and uncomfortable directions as a filmmaker, it's either too derivative or too malformed to work the vast majority of the time."
It's a horror show all right. Stilted line readings creep hand-in-demonic claw with pacing that could induce rigor. If only Mrs. Gas Mask Psychic could have warned us in advance ...
I confess to wondering exactly why this horrific story needed to be rehashed on screen.
Oz's toothless vehicle is never able to capture the dark humor of its calculated convictions...has no apparent rhyme or reason to its meandering madness
There are some great comedies about making movies ranging from the light-hearted (Singin In The Rain) to the satiric (State And Main) to the sardonic (Sunset Boulevard) but leave it to Apatow to add what they lacked: vomit and urine. 
The movie is never as funny or as clever as it tries to be&#44; and it ultimately falls apart in its nonsensical third act&#46;
A perversely courageous disaster that audiences will simply hate.
"The performances are solid, the casting is great and the costumes -- well the costumes are gorgeous. But Cruella plays it too safe and never really finds its feet, let alone its voice."
"With only some scattershot scenes of physical humor, 'Paul Blart: Mall Cop' does little to keep viewers safe from boredom."
"The attempt by Moran and Washington to add some depth to whats basically genre fare is admirable, but the result is disappointingly flat...winds up more muddled than mysterious."
"The result seems almost as hypocritical as many of the movie's targets, which ultimately defeats the movie's intentions."
"A Tale of Love and Darkness is an adaptation of Amos Oz's memoir that's bleak and out-of-focus, but not without some intriguing direction from Natalie Portman."
"I just wish that the script wasn't so insistent on showing off. Shakespeare, even when he kowtowed to the peasants, knew when to quit."
Henry Saine's direction commits totally to the roots of low-budget exploitation flicks. That turns out to be the movie's greatest asset -- and its chief liability.
Will make you hate brides.
This wasn&apos;t enjoyable and made Candyman more absurd than terrifying&#46;&#46;&#46;
I give it a week.
[Director Ira] Sachs underutilizes almost everything. [Full review in Spanish]
"Never scary but frequently cartoonish in its sour humor, Diary of the Dead can't even figure out if it wants to be taken seriously or as a poor, unfunny spoof."
"The setup is the stuff of fantastic political exploration, which makes the generic payoff all the more disappointing."
This film's relationship to actual tension is the same as what Christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow: a poor -- if durable -- imitation.
"Like the book, Reed Morano's film is long on atmosphere and short on the kind of detail a spy thriller needs to be credible."
"An earnest, sometimes skillful effort that nonetheless often feels slack and underwritten, as well as ultimately less-than-rewarding."
"A remake of an adaptation of a novel, Sophia Coppola could have done better than this."
"It presents a fascinating setup with a childhood game that turns into a deadly hunt, giving you a few good thrills and darkly-humorous moments along the way, but unfortunately Busick and Murphy's screenplay doesn't do quite enough with the premise."
"Tom Hardy gives it his all, but Venom falls short in almost every way. It has bad acting, bad pacing and editing, and a silly yet still somehow dull plot. It's another swing and a miss from Sony."
"It's all rather contrived and hackneyed, and even a devotee of old-fashioned mystery pictures won't get more than a very routine sort of entertainment from it. "
"[Jason] Reitman is one of cinema's cleverest filmmakers, but here his blending of humor and sentimentality approaches the maudlin."
"If robots are doing all of the hard work, where are the profits coming from in this slave economy? Who is this corporation exploiting? It only has one market. This makes no sense."
The movie begins with what is probably the most laughable opening scene of the year.
"Any suggestions for the title of fifth film? How about Fast & Furious: I'm Gonna Kick Your Ass? Or, no, I know: Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift."
"Mills's world is certainly not devoid of pain, but it's leached of bitterness, leached of conflict, leached of aggression, leached of hostility; the pain and the trauma are leached of consequence."
A trashy superhero comedy (in yawnsome 3D) that tries to reproduce the innocent charm of its origins as a 1930s radio serial.
"All biopics are dumb and bad, but musical biopics are a very special kind of awful. At best, they are exercises in celebrity karaoke. At worst, they are lip sync battles. Actually, at worst the director of the musical biopic is fired during filming..."
Though far from a worthy successor to the original (but why make impossible demands?) the film clearly could have been much worse.
"Were this a student film, you'd expect to see it returned with a middling grade, covered with red-inked criticisms."
"Netflix’s new long-distance love story is trying to be Nora Ephron for the smartphone generation—except with none of the charm, wit, or romantic tension."
rambling and far too long
"The boxing federation awarded Carter an honorary championship title in 1994; The Hurricane, unfortunately, knocks itself out of the running."
"Whether a melodramatic comment on art and anarchy, or a wild experiment in toxic maternalism, the film feels like a fever that just won't break."
Wilson is the most intolerable of all. Watching him slack his way through this movie made me feel like Lou Dobbs. I didn't like Dupree. I wanted him deported.
"Roth winds up making a mockery of the weighty topics through his ham-fisted mistreatment of them, and he never manages to make any kind of point."
Identity Thief is torture porn. We've been using that term wrong for years.
So hip it makes your teeth hurt.
"The film looks like nothing so much as a very shrewd compendium of what the market requires. Pretty In Pink is a teenage version of those wrong side of the tracks romances of some 30 years ago, impeccably dressed in mid-eighties clobber."
"An overdirected, overphotographed, overdone movie that is so distracted by its hectic, relentless style that the story line is rendered almost incoherent."
"Lacking purpose or thoughtful complexity, Flowers' film is an overly ambitious mess."
"Far from being the contest between equals that its title implies, Kramer vs. Kramer pays only marginal lip service to the mother's side of the story, a gambit that robs the picture of depth and ultimately minimizes its emotional punch."
"Always thought there was an evil design behind all those giant mirrors at clothes stores. But how evil are they? Put Alexandre Aja behind the camera, and what do you think?"
"On screen that takes about one minute in the final consummation, but in the case of the 40-Year-Old-Virgin, the film, the audience gets screwed for 90 minutes straight."
"Wan, trite and increasingly silly."
A likeable but forgettable trifle.
'The difference between men and boys is the size of their toys'...and the epic length and cacophany of their thrill rides.
A film that never quite clicks tonally and doesn't do justice to its harrowing central story.
"Though Dunst is a saving grace, it's an awfully clunky, self-indulgent little heap of garbage."
Gus Van Sant is obviously rebelling against Hollywood-style films but going to the other extreme is not the answer.
All concept and no meaning.

"An affluent African-American family is going through some domestic issues: Husband loses job, daughter is being ignored, mother has a foot-odour situation - the usual. The answer? Submit to a resurrected carpenter."
I didn’t laugh once in this movie. A shadow of the memory of the rumor of a smile never once threatened to appear on my face. 
"It takes a special actor's grace to survive a script as lame as My Fellow Americans, and James Garner has it. Without appearing to break a sweat, Garner makes each grotesquely desperate attempt at humor look smooth and assured."
Sincere but heavy-handed...One breakthrough that 'Breakthrough' does not achieve...is the one that would move it beyond preaching-to-the-choir status.
"Like all tasty confections, there's a sell through date for 'American Pie,' and it's long passed."
"The pace plods, and this heavily furnished, inadequately ventilated movie never entirely comes to life."
"Not really terrible, but way too dry and dull for any self-respecting serial killer biopic."
It never lands the necessary emotional or comedic punches.
It's nice that they're so supportive of one another; too bad the whole exercise is so tedious for us.
The best entries in the franchise elicit a genuine sense of wonder. The only wonder on display here is wondering how things turned out so terribly dull.

Few things are more disappointing than watching one of your favorite comedians struggling through an off night. So it goes with Christopher Guest's latest feature For Your Consideration.
"Even with Anne Hathaway and Rebel Wilson as con artists, the setups are flat, the jokes don't land and the actors strain for laughs that never come. Be warned about this femcentric spin on Dirty Rotten Scoundrels-it's the audience that gets hustled."
It's disappointing that a movie made by women and starring some of the best working actresses tackling a large subject couldn't add more to the conversation.
Essentially amounts to a case of what could have been.
"Careful, tasteful, enervated. The film kills off its one unpredictable presence; the company you're left in doesn't compensate."
"Half the film comprises a teenager screaming Bible verses, making it as much an endurance test as an invigorating cautionary tale."
"It's called Evolution, but the would-be comedy about an alien life form that crashes to Earth and spawns mutants with enormous sphincters is quite the devolution from Ghostbusters."
Fantastic Four functions at the level of a below average Saturday-morning cartoon.
"This is a futuristic thriller about cloning, which is ironic given that The Island is a clone of half a dozen much better sci-fi movies."
Extra points for liberal use of chicken innards as wholesale gore. Minus points for not being funny enough.
A kind of nifty little sci-fi noir that's only satisfying if you don't pay attention to the fact that it doesn't really do anything besides look cool.
"A ramshackle affair...It's diverting, but insubstantial."
A bombastic piece of junk called Hell's Highway.
The movie supports its optimistic agenda by evading or overlooking many hard realities of the historical period it supposedly wants to explore and understand. The result is a winning but ultimately dishonest portrait.
"Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones."
A harrowing but tedious chronicle of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas' time in America in the 1950s.
Although Away We Go doesn't sum to the icon of loveliness that the filmmakers might have hoped for - it is too tonally fractured - the movie does suggest avenues that Sam Mendes might consider exploring in the future.
"For all its technical accomplishment and cultural specificity, Trollhunter never really clicks on all cylinders. It's mostly droll, but doesn't consistently foment either dread or delight, owing to a need for sharper characterizations."
Anna Kendrick steals the show when she's onscreen but one wishes that the script itself was worthy of this concept and her talent.
"We all have fun goofing around with our friends -- it's just that when you're four hot-hot-hot directors, you can goof around with your friends and get Miramax to release it, with predictably unimpressive results."
"Like any beloved book with a pretty film version, there will be fans of this film, in spite of its flaws. And bless them. I was, mostly, frustrated."
Definitely not the best from Luke Scott. It only entertains. [Full review in Spanish]
"...Jóhannsson crafts an uncompromising tale, one of absurdism, lust, taboo, and folk tales. But fails to arrive at any particular tier of excitement, intrigue, or affection."
it's hard to root for their reconciliation
"Jenny Gage's sudsy After offers run-of-the-mill college romance targeted to the PG-13 demographic. The result, a far cry from the lustier stories upon which it is based, misses the mark despite an appealing performance from Josephine Langford."
One seeks in vain for an adequate development in this film of the powerful psychology which must remain the essential motive of such a fantasy as Stevenson created. A mere succession of incidents does not furnish this study.
"On some very basic levels, Hugo just isn't very good."
"Mild and predictable, the very things an adventure movie should never be."
The kind of thing that probably read a lot funnier than it plays.
"Without the considerable contributions of Reese Witherspoon and the ensemble supporting her, this overblown trifle would be akin to nails on a chalkboard."
"The biggest fault is that comparatively little attention is given to the monsters. We see a swish of tail here, a giant foot there, but too often we're denied a lingering look at the destroyers."
Brendan Fraser: Human being or cartoon character?
"It never occurs to you to think of the film as anything other than a silly swords-and-castles tale, and a particularly ineffective one at that."
"There's the makings of a nasty satire of modern American materialism [here] but in the end...the movie goes soft, squishy and even--heaven help us--preachy."
The film fills with simple solutions for difficult situations. [Full review in Spanish]
A cockamamie smuggling thriller remade from an Icelandic original by Balthasar Kormakuar.
"The film starts off credibly and compellingly, until it turns its attention to its objects of scorn."
"The film begins and ends with homilies, slogans and hackneyed dialectics of female struggles (the struggles are real, it's the dramatic dialectic that's hackneyed). "
"The actors are sort of stuck on screen without much of a story to pull the viewer along, and some fare better than others."
"Woody Harrelson does what he can with the lead role in Wilson, but as movie characters go, his Wilson finishes a distant runner up to the volleyball in Castaway."
The key is to not think too much. Remember that.
"Egregiously silly, generic ..."
"After a strong, visually striking, resonant start, Lost River quickly descends into a fugue of memorable imagery signifying little and regularly abandons its established motifs for others."
"It's pointless, it's tedious, it's dull, and worst of all, it's lazy."
The Glass Castle tortures more than graces.
A lot of flash in service of a junky story.
"There's a sweet romance fighting to reach the surface here, but it's ultimately a losing battle against the overpowering and sour Sandler crassness."
"There's a laughable irony to the film. It preaches imagination the way a fundamentalist preaches the Ten Commandments, yet exhibits so little of it."
"""The Angry Birds Movie"" is just fowl."
"Talented and versatile actor-comedian John Leguizamo indulges himself so totally with incessant mugging, mimicking and all-around showing off that he begins to wear out his welcome before the opening credit sequence is over."
"A comedy deserving to be buried up to its head in sand, drizzled in cooking oil and then left to fry until crispy."
Morrison's book is painfully honest and whilst the film is sensitively handled and impeccably crafted it is also curiously distant and unmoving.
Beattie can certainly tell a story. But is this a story worth telling?
"Pike works wonders to make a thin story feel full and satisfying to watch in the moment, but once it's over, the thinness starts to become bothersome, especially given the arresting subject matter at its core."
"Maybe Millennials will laugh at the narrow scope observational humor about life in Los Angeles, but the film doesn't have a whole lot to say. It's not universally relatable."
Everyone involved just watched their stock price drop 79%.
"It's not easy to be life-affirming and satirical in the same breath, and Crowe can't quite manage the job."
The slick-but-skin-deep Heist is little more than an engagingly empty exercise.
The barriers that divide text from subtext and meta-text are torn down in War for the Planet of the Apes; instead we get all of them at once in a pasteurized soup of signification.
SherryBaby is more often concerned with getting everything right the American indie way rather than trying to probe its characters and situations for emotional truths.
"Murphy needs to do two things: fire his agent, and learn to discern when a script is worth doing or not."
has enough flash to satisfy audiences simply looking for a bit of holiday escapist fun.
"...if this isn't the most mind-numbingly idiotic movie made this century, it gives others something to shoot at."
"The slender, seemingly autobiographical film has its share of neurotic charms and funny one-liners, but it's too tentative about digging into its identity conflicts -- sexual or cultural."
"The development probably works in Glendon Swarthout's novel of the same name, where Swank is nowhere in sight. But not in the theater. You're tempted to give up on the movie because it feels as if the movie has given up on her."
A wretched roundball comedy.
"Based on the contrivance-heavy screenplay and Cuesta's Six Feet Under-tutelaged direction, you'd think the filmmakers just got off the boat from Eden and found themselves in the cities of the plain."
"Relentlessly murky and meandering, V/H/S will have some wanting the urge to push the eject button on their 25 year-old VCR player."
"Even as it zeros in on radical shifts in the mechanics and mores of parenthood, it sits quite comfortably in a well-worn romantic-comedy groove."
"Interestingly, the more overblown and insincere a performance Pacino delivers in a film, the more self-important and bouffant his hair gets. Here, it's so towering it takes up 90 per cent of the screen."
This romantic psychological/sci-fi thriller is pretty to look at but basically empty inside.
"The Devil's Backbone stands out because of its rich desert-dust palette of golden brown, but otherwise takes no discernable visual stance."
within this otherwise formulaic family film are elements so atrocious that they remove any heart Murphy manages to mine.
"That seventh-son-of-a-seventh-son business sounds like Muddy Waters singing, 'Got my Mojo Workin'.'"
Well-intentioned but hardly convincing depiction of the haunting Afghanistan landscape.
"Nothing spells funny like someone in a fat suit -- unless, of course, it's someone in a fat suit suffering from flatulence. That's the ne plus ultra of comedy."
N-Secure is a disjointed assemblage of scenes that still manages to roll down the track while never picking up a head of steam.
"Filled with audacious silly behavior, none of which has an edge to make its comedy sharp."
"Certainly of interest, if only for its vintage. But the film is drab and slight."
"Though it's made with great energy and inventiveness, there's something ultimately muddy about ""Tomorrowland""; it's as if director Brad Bird got so caught up in the sets and effects and whooshing editing that the story somehow slipped away."
Thoroughly unoriginal and screams of desperation. Over Her Dead Body is a fitting title; this is a DOA dud.
Far from achieving the holy grail of comedy.
"One of the worst endings to a movie since Bobby Ewing stepped out of the shower on ""Dallas."""
"Tucci's slow-paced storytelling in ""Big Night"" was brave and worked beautifully, but the same technique in ""Joe Gould's Secret"" becomes annoying."
"In the current economic climate, this comedy about workers whose livelihood is rescued by a benevolent boss represents the ultimate wish-fulfillment fantasy. Don't spend your hard-earned discretionary cash on it."
"A romantic action thriller with Inception-like ambitions, this one, sadly, falls short."
"While the original book assumed an adult level of intelligence, the film pitches itself squarely at the sort of American teenager who would be shocked to learn that a fast food chain was anything but a pillar of the local community."
The biggest error of Irresistible is that its more concerned with making a point than telling a good story. 
It feels like the movie doesn't have anything else up its sleeve.
The King's Daughter is a series of scenes edited together that has no idea what movie it ultimately wants to be.
"This is a dour, colorless depiction of the city, skipping urban realism for some kind of heightened action ennui."
"Predictable story beats occur, right in line with some of the tragic difficulties many of us faced while in lockdown, and it feels more contrived than authentic."
"I enjoyed parts of this amusing little romp, the clever bits, decent performances, and a certain real feeling to the dialog when it isn't trying to be something that it's not."
"The band's few hits, like ""Cherry Bomb"" and ""Queens of Noise,"" are all over the soundtrack, but the music, much like the people who made it, feels like an afterthought."
"There's certainly the material there for a challenging coming-of-age drama, but Nowhere Boy is no more than a typical celebrity biopic, the kind you might see on BBC4, without any of the flair you might hope for from Taylor-Wood and Greenhalgh."
"Awful music, obnoxious editing, overwrought camera work, and strained comedy can't hide the hackneyed, smarmy pointlessness of it all."
"One of storytelling's most overworked clichs - the great artist as insufferable human being - gets a full workout in ""Genius,"" a labored true-life drama that is someone's bad idea for Oscar bait."
This is as joyless a spy caper as one could devise.
"There are good bits among the bad (the giant's bullying, bratty kinfolk especially), but mostly, there's simply not enough there."
"The story is overly simple, and the movies cast  with one-time 24 star and Allstate Insurance pitchman Dennis Haysbert easily being the most recognizable of the faces  has a distinct TV-movie feel."
A prime example of romantic-comedy by the numbers.
Bollywood For Beginners.
"With all the blue-haired, flying, screaming, mind-melding hi-jinks this film has to offer, you'd think it would be able to squeeze in a few novel bursts of fun."
So disassembled and unfunny that if this has any auteurist continuity at all it is with Phillips's equally disassembled and unfunny Riders on the Storm.
"Rote situations, wooden dialogue, and Jason Statham."
"Boasts a distinctive style and tone, but the style is arch and quaint, and the tone too insistently quirky."
"""Secret In Their Eyes"" seems interested in making a point about the potential hazards of giving in to one's most ardent passions, bu such a notion isn't developed by the script."
Occupation: Rainfall's basic plot and cheesy effects hinder the Australian sci-fi epic's potential despite a good cast and solid ideas.
"Stellar casting and expert design separate this a bit from the pulp pack, but genre fans will feel let down in the end."
"Stuck in a role that no one could steer straight, Lindsay Lohan looks aged by the experience."
"Imagine a gritty version of the 'Simpsons' episode where Santa's Little Helper runs away and becomes a scary fighting mutt - shorn of the Laddie subplot, alas."
Take away the visual razzle dazzle and you're not left with much of a movie.
"with so many famous people playing famous people to varying degrees of quality, it seems like a weak Saturday Night Live sketch without the jokes"
"Everest is nice to watch, and pretty impressive technically. But it becomes a bit of an effort after a while, and it's always hard to deeply sympathise with the thrill-seeking western climbers."
Welcome to Marwen is not only one of the worst films released by a major studio in 2018; it's also one of the most offensive.
"The growing attraction between Caine and Jupiter doesn't get much time to blossom though.Because they spend so much time running from one scene to the next, there isn't much space of characters to grow or unfold into anything compelling."
"[""I Feel Pretty] attempts to deliver an inspiring message but ends up undercutting itself at every opportunity."
"For a film about magic, there's little sparkle to spare."
What could have possessed the people involved in Xanadu to go ahead with this utter nonsense?
"A drab, remedial gangster film."
"an ambitious film, but also a somewhat muddled one"
Evolution seems designed to kill screen time rather than tell a story.
"The director Ross Katz, making his feature directing debut, does occasionally move the camera around, but for the most part he just points and shoots his performers talking, joking, whining, sharing and caring."
Shyamalan puts his thumbs on the scales and dramatically changes Tremblay&#8217;s conclusion&#44; shifting the story&#8217;s empathetic core and telling the audience in no uncertain terms who should be sacrificed and who should be saved&#46; 
"A frenetic action comedy that never puts on the brakes. It is a wild ride no doubt, but it isn’t the kind of wedding to which I need to be invited any time soon."
"These characters had a great run, but based on this sorry sequel, there's nothing interesting left to do with them."
...an entirely misbegotten capper to a seriously erratic series.
"In creating Jarhead, the filmmakers opt for a segmented, episodic style that befits the narrative's origins in a book. On film, that style generates few connecting threads or smooth flow."
"""6 Souls"" is regrettably sick with that familiar disease afflicting movies of this ilk: ostentatious, hollow moodiness that spreads like an unwelcome rash."
"It's strong on claustrophobia, but extremely weak on characterisation, so it's not terribly involving."
"Outlandishly inept in every way, 'Left Behind' is easily one of the worst movies of 2014."
"It's a Bland, Dull, Dumb Movie."
"Wondrous as all this artifice is, it's also a huge distraction. The self-consciousness of the structure keeps us at arm's length emotionally."
This is one of those films in which the Act of Driving becomes a 10-minute statement of high emptiness.
Cox once more indulges his unfortunate penchant for explaining the meaning of life.
Will Smith&apos;s latest Oscar-chasing provocation of existential platitudes and placating pabulum is trying to be a contemporary &quot;Christmas Carol&#46;&quot; Instead&#44; this odious&#44; distasteful drama just winds up emphasizing the &quot;dick&quot; in Dickens&#46;
"There needs to be something more than the sheer spectacle of fine character actors like Tony Goldwyn, John C. McGinley and others butchering their colleagues in every conceivable way."
"In addition to endorsing the logic that keeps spouses Stockholm syndrome'd in bad marriages, ""Acrimony"" also offers poor economic advice."
"We were promised desolation, but ""The Hobbit"" just keeps dragon on."
"Silly? Sure. However, when Smith's not trying to win Oscars he's practically perfected the art of selling silliness at the box-office."
Maybe at the next 'Best Man' reunion Malcolm D. Lee will work these problems out
"Oh Sister, I have such doubt. Doubt about an audience getting conned into taking seriously such a rickety piece of movie junk like this."
"Neither director McG nor writer Luc Besson are known for their austere realism, so expect rampant witlessness among all the bone-crunching, blood-spraying action."
"Zemeckis seems to think he's showing heart. Instead, he's messily dissecting it."
"While Blended isn't as aggressively terrible as [Adam Sandler]'s recent crop of films, it's not very funny either."
"We expected great things, but the truth is that Mortal Engines leaves much to be desired. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Though it reunites the stars and director of the rousingly old-fashioned swashbuckler The Mask of Zorro (1998), this unnecessary and overlong sequel fails to recapture its predecessor's zing."
"Alien invaders behave intelligently before acting really, really stupidly in ""The 5th Wave,"" a tween-oriented sci-fi adventure that synthesizes ""They Live,"" ""The Hunger Games,"" and countless other visitors-from-another-world sagas."

"Even though his new movie is awful, at least Waters was honest enough to stick it with an accurate title."
"This Is 40 is intermittently funny, frequently embarrassing and, at 134 minutes, quite a bit too long."
"Despite reported re-shoots and re-edits, The Woman In The Window still feels half-finished, as if some key creative under-estimated the high level of craft involved in delivering a passable Hitchcock knock-off and finally just walked away."
It almost felt like the characters weren't really reciting dialogue that came from them but rather just simply memorizing it off the script.
"Depp does about as well as anyone other than Len Cariou could with his one-note character. Bonham-Carter gives Mrs. Lovett a game stab, but she suffers from all that freaky makeup and lacks the voice of an Angela Lansbury."
"The question is not whether Blood Diamond succeeds as a mature, politically-minded piece of entertainment but whether it should be an entertainment in the first place."
'Enigma' is a good name for a movie this delibrately obtuse and unapproachable. A waste of good performances.
"Romano's a small-screen vampire, and 35mm is his sunlight."
"A feeble, reactionary drama."
This uneven narrative and screenplay not only affects Grandage&#8217;s direction&#44; which seems to prioritise style over substance&#44; but also the casting&#46;
"Even as a zombie film, it comes across not as something new, but as something warmed-over."
"In all, it's a recipe for a different kind of throwback, The Conjuring by way of direct to video sequel."
A talented cast and a handsome sense of time and place can't save this thriller from being caught in a cliche-ridden and uninspiring undertow.
"A dark and dank hellscape of hideously malformed creatures, where charm and whimsy and even Lewis Carroll's peerless wordplay go to die."
"What should have been a shamelessly filthy stoner movie has been watered down with ill-judged, undergraduate musings on religion, philosophy and race."
"Taking place under a leaden cloud of inevitability and charting the depressingly inexorable botching of a second chance, what does Party Girl ultimately have to tell us about the world?...Nothing particularly good, and nothing particularly new."
Jonze has produced a gorgeous $80 million Muppet Movie in the shape of an art film that will bore kids as much as it will depress adults.
McCarthy has a talent to unsettle - still not entirely developed.
"Without Zola's churning narrative and analytical bite, the movie plays like an animatronic museum piece."
"As far as poor man's versions of Steven Soderbergh's The Limey go, one can probably do worse than The Outsider."
"I don't know, maybe I'm spoiled. But we've already seen Jaws and we've already seen The Abyss, so do we really need a low-rent combination of the two?"
"It professes to be good for viewers by kicking them below the knee, thereby testing their sensitivity reflexes."
"How did 3 Days to Kill, which doesn't have the worst imaginable premise, turn out this bad?"
"Rather than delivering a truly exhilarating climax, The Rise of Skywalker merely constructs an OK one. It's a missed opportunity in a lot of ways."
"The acting, with the exception of Bojana Novakovic, adds nothing to the trite plot."
"Guys has the lax, sleep-deprived vibe of one of those end-of-the-show ""experimental"" sketches on Saturday Night Live."
"Lopez can act, but why bother in something so painfully false? You don't empower anyone with a lobotomy."
The movie would be perfect material for a resurrected version of the TV spoof Mystery Science Theater.
"It's meant to be a cartoon, and one dripping with gore, but there are one too many moments where Sokolov is more attentive to cinematographic precision than inspired twists and turns."
"By the time the story hits some unlikely Kumbaya notes, we fully expect Barney (of purple reign fame) to appear on the scene and lead humans and dinosaurs alike in a campfire sing-along."
Distinctly underwhelming.
"The first words spoken in Victor Frankenstein are ""You know the story,"" and anyone who simply mutters ""Yep,"" gets up, and heads back to the box office for a refund will be well ahead of the game."
The John Ford cliches clang against the Sergio Leone sloppy seconds with the hollow ring of a church bell.
Visual flourishes overwhelm narrative substance in this dark coming-of-age neo-noir that bogs down in relentless brooding.
There are poop jokes and c*m shots but nothing as insightfully twisted as the diarrhea twins.
"The theme is moving, but the way it's told is hardly brilliant. [Full review in Spanish]"
Uninspired biopic sheds little light on unfathomable maritime mystery.
"This comedy about female best friends whose bond is shattered when their weddings fall on the same date occasionally displays a desire to explore the nature of friendship and love, but unfortunately such moments of insight take a backseat to increasingly"
"There are spit-takes and lies; small dogs and mishaps. And, to cap it off, an impassioned dash to the airport. Seriously."
It's so amped up that High Voltage suffers its own energy shortage well before the finale. It's also every bit as stupid as it sounds.
"...an uninvolving film about a self-absorbed woman, director Linklater showed in 'Me and Orson Welles' that he could make a good movie. This isn't it."
"And sure, while fresh-faced actors belting out reworked top-40 hits sounds tolerably safe and familiar, Pitch Perfect makes Glee look like Mad Men."
"A blockbuster phenomenon that wouldn't exist without the efforts of other films, and somehow smugly pats itself on the back for it."
Don't bother playing.
"As raw and a flight of adolescent fancy as Saturday Night Live's ""Lazer Cats!"" skits."
"A grade-A misfire, fantastically uninvolving, a cinematic train wreck of slacked-jawed, distinguished proportions. Read on for more fun..."
"superficial blockbuster fodder, furthering the worrying decline in Worthington's output since Avatar."
"To a batter, a great curveball is so obvious and so frustrating at the same time. Robert Lorenz's Trouble with the Curve is much the same."
Starts with artful delusions before dribbling into nothingness
"The promise is to scare you out of your wits. Does it work? For me: no. To tell you the truth, I was bored, frustrated and nauseous from the terminally jerky hand-held camera"
Fish food.
"Throbbing musical crescendos and flickery flashbacks abound but apart from some outlandish plot machinations, nothing here is good or bad enough to be memorable."
"It's great that Glass strives for deeper meaning. However, by throwing so much at the audience so quickly, it unravels its own goal."
"Not even the usually twinkle-eyed Maggie Smith, here playing Catherine's aunt, can buoy the material."
"Although Race to Witch Mountain is about space travelers, little soars here. The film is so by-the-book (and we don't mean Key's 1968 novel) that it's hard to recount it without reverting to blahblahblah."
"Has been made by people who are trying to be bad, which by definition reveals that they are playing beneath their ability."
"...chick flick city...a mnage  trois-lite...agonizing to watch poor Emily Blunt laugh uproariously at contrived, slice of life conversation made with her sister"
"12 Strong may not exactly be what we need, but it does seem to be what audiences desperately want. I just wish 12 Strong was brave enough to take a cue from the real-life heroes they're honoring and give us something better."
"As loosely adapted from Elmore Leonard's Get Shorty sequel novel, the sequel movie Be Cool tastes like a watered-down drink."
"""Jesus,"" Jolie groans, ""have I become that dull?"" Yes, in fact, and with her name all over the credits, there's no one else to blame."
"Throughout Chasing Mavericks, directors Curtis Hanson and Michael Apted fail to tap into surfing's joy and wildness, its ability to transform a man on various levels."
"The more it goes on, the more frustrating its superficiality becomes and by the end Pieces of a Woman is compromised by its own narrative indecisiveness."
"As a thriller, it's passable, but at what point do we say to director Neil LaBute, ""Enough already with the misogynistic themes""?"
This exceptional life ... is smothered by a cloying fairy tale romance that turns every challenge the couple faces into a lark.
"The biggest piece of hooey since the thrill-less Stallone/Stone thriller ""The Specialist."""
The film is the equivalent of the 'dumb blonde' of action movies. No plot? No problem. Smile pretty now.
"It feels as though it would have been better served as a six-part sitcom, where its sentimentality, broad comedy and fantasy elements wouldn't rub up against each other so badly."
Very Unhappy Movie
"There are jokes. Some of them even land. But they land the way the final bite of a too-rich dessert land, nauseatingly and full of regret."
"Subtlety is never this movie's strong point; then again, it's nearly impossible to pinpoint what this movie's strengths are."
"In terms of sheer directorial craft, ""The Walk"" is masterful, but as storytelling, it's a near-disaster."
"Despite a couple of legitimate laughs, it's largely unwatchable."
Clumsy symbolism undermines a tenacious performance from Sigman.
"Utterly unreal space story from Luc Besson (he of The Fifth Element fame), who seems to have watched James Cameron's Avatar and decided he could make it sillier, more scattered, and less emotionally engaging."
Avoid.
"Essentially a so-so episode of ""Black Mirror."""
"The film is about a group of MIT students who used a very smart card-counting system to milk the casinos. But the movie blows off the deeper thrills of its source material to make a tidier, less compelling amorality play."
"Completely artificial...a flimsy, flabby picture in which the romantic chemistry is forced, the script does nothing unexpected and the direction is slack."
"It's neither great nor horrible, but rather just middle-of-the-road, wrapped in slick production values and featuring an able-bodied, but misguided cast."
Has enough clichs and cut-out characters to condemn it to mediocrity.
Might have made a good episode of 'Entourage'.
"Adam Driver shines as usual in this art-house musical, but he can't warm up an emotionally detached film."
This remake seems even emptier than the cringe-inducing original film.
"Since The Honeymooners is not a respectful tribute to the original, nor does it stand on its own, a beloved piece of American entertainment has officially been besmirched."
So much potential from the actors and the setting but a poor follow through leads the entertainment value downhill&#46;
&#91;It&apos;s&#93; a good-looking movie&#44; and it has its moments&#44; but overall&#44; I felt like the &quot;1950s-type-suburbia-are-hiding-something-sinister&quot; theme was just too shopworn&#46; 
"You can almost hear the filmmakers exhale with nervous relief, having made it through a film about incest without actually having an opinion on the subject."
It's a feature-length whine of frustrated entitlement. A movie less suited to its cultural moment would be hard to imagine.
"The movie was just okay...the military guys were so terrible, and everyone is so generic in it."
"The film is a head-on collision of spare parts from different genres, none of which work separately or as a collective whole."
What's a bad sequel but a revenant soul doomed to repeat itself?
"""Overcomer"" offers nothing in the way of nuance - even its title is awkward - and, also, no respite from its religious propagandizing."
It's an often-awkward niche film enlivened by impressive on-field action scenes. But those can't get it beyond a predictable sports underdogs-fight-back plot.

[I]t's clear that the film doesn't paint [Abdul] as a fleshed-out person. He's just a queen's cultural boy toy.
"Cruz has everything it takes to be a big star, except maybe, in this case, the right movie."
'The Killing Gene' feels like a film that was trying to be something else -- maybe a dark and bloody episode of 'The Wire.'
Perhaps the best one can say for this bland concoction mixed by agents and the studio executives is that every bartender in Hollywood wants to be Tom Cruise and that suffices as an ironic subtext.
"And what's funnier than watching an elderly iguana named Miss Knickerbocker driving a Ferrari? Watching an elderly iguana driving a Ferrari while singing System of a Down, of course."
"Lifeless, laughable and lame, Winter's Tale is set to frustrate fans of Mark Helprin's 1983 fantasy novel and flummox everybody else."
Mummies could have been a wildly imaginative adventure about the contrasts between ancient Egypt and modern London&#44; but this boring animated film has a clunky narrative&#44; unremarkable visuals&#44; and a stale plot&#46; 
"In gleefully, thumpingly hyperbolic terms, it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass, jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz."
"When the creators of The Last Exorcism Part II swapped pseudo-verité realism for psychological realism, they made it a lot harder to take their franchise seriously ..."
There isn't much style to this stage adaptation but it moves along at a good clip and leaves more casualties than you might expect.
"Despite the competent animation, the great tunes, and funny voice work by costars Russell Brand and John Cleese, Trolls is a lackluster entry. The story is clichéd and predictable. Overall, the film has no real magic."
"Has the mark of something dashed off after reading what dozens of screenwriting manuals had to say about the marketplace and the three-act paradigm, but not one word about characterization or dramatic unity."
Milk presents details about the title character and his relevance... but the presentation itself appears more intent on being a recruitment film than an actual biopic.
"The navy-blue cinematography of Boston is well lit, the Florida atmosphere looks like a commercial for Dade County orange juice, the actors all look like they are awaiting directions from Affleck by cell phone."
In the end it can't help but be pulled under by its own undertow of mawkishness.
"By the time The Hunter jettisons its narrative ballast altogether and embraces its elemental appeal, it's too late."
"It seems that 'two smoking barrels' was more than enough. Three is pushing it. Or, as the newly-separated spouse Madonna may have said, 'Enough already.'"
Part of it delivers knock-out images and exquisite camerawork. The other part is just one big fish story.
Inconveniently this Inconvenient Sequel feels redundant...little [more] than a campaign video for Gore's mission.
"This anthology promises to be wild and blasphemous, but only three episodes are funny or witty (the usual problem with compilations); the all-star cast, particularly Paul Rudd and Winona Ryder, is good."
"Here's a film that says Christmas is a sellout, that your neighbors are morons, and that suburbia is a playground of fascist conformity, and then it concludes that anyone who actually believes that is a heartless Scrooge."
"Colin Warner's story deserves to be heard, but it also deserved a better presentation that kept its audience's engagement."
"Heart of the Game does contain a powerful human story, but we are forced to watch it from a distance. Serrill never penetrates its fringes."
"Insufferably certain of its own charm and a lot less interested in educating viewers than it purports to be, Jeremy Seifert's GMO OMG offers an introduction to genetically modified food that is only slightly more thoughtful than the movie's title."
"Unfortunately, the movie suffers from what all musical biopics tend to: clichs."
"Essentially a long-winded excuse for action sequences and Diesel making menacing faces, mostly over his left shoulder."
"When the suspenseful plot is ultimately unraveled, it turns out to be a cynical, cinematic riddle that makes little sense."
"Everybody involved with the awful comedy ""Is That a Gun in Your Pocket?..."" owes Aristophanes an apology."
"So much of Malick's method appears aimed at distanciation of the audience... We sit outside, staring in, wondering at these strange denizens of a far-away place."
Idlewild overflows with inventiveness and random weirdness that sort of make it a must-see even if it isn't a particularly good film.
"Ira Levin's novel furnished the interesting futuristic theory of cybernetics, but William Goldman's screenplay is as mundane as Bryan Forbe's direction."
The disappointment in Music of the Heart comes from a strangely fragmented narrative that never quite commits to a central story.
"For anyone who entertained hopes for Get Smart and has not been entertained back, the film's main fault will lie in its wobbly translation."
A movie of epically assaultive noise and nonsense.
"Imagine a feature-length version of the ""Large Marge"" sequence from Pee-wee's Big Adventure and you won't be too far off, only that was scarier."
"It is what it is, I just wish it wasn't."
"The movie's light, airy tone comes to a screeching halt in certain scenes that are excessively sentimental, melodramatic and preachy."

"The film doesn't have a large enough body count for a slasher, not enough high school angst for a teen dramedy, and not enough debauchery for exploitation."
"This pudgy, obvious DeNiro is definitely not the one I grew up admiring."
"Do you think a guy like [Vin] Diesel would ever allow himself to remark, on camera, that he's getting too old for this?"
"Ball drops the poisonous little voodoo dolls he mistakes for characters into a ... realistic environment, as though that will somehow render his story more ""serious."""
[A] film that has spent an hour and forty-five minutes puffing itself into a battle for the Soul of American Democracy feebly hisses its way to a deflated conclusion.
The equivalent of one long drone from a stiff Social Studies teacher who can scarcely be bothered to add any sort of relevance to the topic.
"The concept may not be bad, but there are times when the execution borders on embarassing."
Is this camp?
"The film discreetly tiptoes around rumors of Earhart's reputed bisexuality (""Maybe at one time,"" she says) and her relationship with aviation pioneer Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor impersonating a department-store dummy)."
"What's disappointing about Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile (other than its ridiculously long title), is that [it] feels like a missed opportunity."
The film resolves the romantic dilemma in the most artificial and unsatisfying way.
"The movie is like the play date from hell, the kind where a crew of children reduce your home to rubble and conduct endless bouts of loud war on the living-room floor while you ponder the propriety of opening a bottle of wine."
"Boring, sentimental crap made better by the inferior sequel."
"As Saul and Caprice embellish their portfolios, the weakness of the scenario grows more obvious."
"With all the digital and environmental tomfoolery, it's a shock that Chipwrecked wasn't released in 3D, and that renders it ever so slightly more respectable. But seriously, Jason Lee, you're so much better than this. Please, stop now."
"There's an element of magic here, and it's safe to say that a certain degree of disbelief needs to be suspended, but even children may suffer to get much out of this foreign signing."
"Just to set the taste level, the first line in The Uninvited is 'I love you, I have a condom.' Yep, the bar is already lowered."
"There are moments in the film of almost complete entropy, when the camera is running and it is horrifyingly clear that no one has the slightest idea what to do."

Good intentions alone can't salvage this aggressively heavy-handed Mother Teresa biopic that perhaps could use some divine filmmaking intervention.
A scattered grab bag of images and noises.
Aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups: very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters.
It is a film where art direction triumphs but genuine art remains elusive.
"This Halloween wants to rewrite the canon and be the definitive sequel, but it is merely just another sequel."
"If you kept at it, you could probably think of 23 other similar movies you'd rather be watching."
The essence of the film: a prolonged denial of well-deserved cake after teasing with a few delicious crumbs.
"A gooey mess, but not an entirely dislikable one."
"Why, after nearly 90 minutes of splattering limbs, cat-fighting hookers and characters gleefully being set afire, does Carnahan suddenly decide to veer into operatic Michael Mann territory?"
Mawkish but energized.
A third-rate kiddie movie that should've gone straight to video as originally planned.
"A quick Google search will provide more historical insight than the screenplay, which is hampered by wooden dialogue and narrative clichés. Worse, it looks as cheap as it sounds."
A metaphysical muddle.
"The costumes designed by Sandy Powell - leather gowns and military uniforms, Renaissance in silhouette and detailed with zippers - are the film's most arresting element."
"All in all, it's rather pleasant, but nothing else."
A wacky horror outing that almost works.
So relentlessly violent and grim that it makes you yearn for a purifying shower.
"Hilton has the meticulously manicured appeal of a lawn where every blade of grass has been individually cut and polished. Head coyly tilted, hip out-thrust, she makes purring kitten, predatory lioness moves not often seen outside of beer ads."
It makes this sort of film so frustrating to watch&#44; because the ingredients for an enjoyable thrill ride are all set up wonderfully&#46; That it all stumbles and falls apart at the midpoint suggests a production that failed to trust the material&#46;
"A Southern Gothic wilderness weepie with proletarian occult leanings, a masculinzed femme fatale selfie, workingclass wallpaper, and weirdly anachronistic back to future ecological activism. While filming in a Czech forest, to access cheap nonunion labor."
Every scene between two people comes off like drunkenly shot video of a play rehearsal gone horribly wrong.
"Almost as offensive as ""Freddy Got Fingered."""
"The assassination thriller Vantage Point might have been a triumph of form over content, technique over substance, if only there were anything worthy about its form or technique."
Midler's singing is the only pleasant part of the film. The rest of it you've seen and heard before -- and better.
"It doesn't know how to finish in a satisfying fashion, thus dragging the rest of the film down with its conclusion."
"Beautiful vistas, Thora Birch and a cute bear can't compensate for the routine story and sloppy direction of this old-fashioned family adventure about the courageous efforts of two children to find their missing father."
The world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like Martin Scorsese. But it doesn't need Gangs of New York.
...too grim and lifeless to spark wonder in either kids or adults.
"The best I can say about Maleficent is that it isn't as bad as I thought it would be, but that's faint praise indeed."
The only thing more disconcerting than seeing an action-disaster sequence open a Clint Eastwood drama is watching the 80-year-old auteur channel M. Night Shyamalan.
A disappointing costume drama.
"It's not swinging for the fences, in fact it isn't even holding a bat: It's counting on getting plunked in order to get on base."
"Terribly shot and written, Glazer's got Rourke facing death so many times that an hour in you're hoping someone will just shoot him already, or at least you, and end this awful experiment."
Hot idea. Tepid execution.
It mainly comes across with a numbing predictability that extends even to its attemptedly shocking late-act plot revelation.
"Beautifully rendered, but hurt by moving extremely slowly, especially in its first half."
Blanks ... directs in almost entirely suspense-free fashion.

A $70 million novelty item.
"I suppose there's a certain kooky charm, but talk about dated..."
"When the movie backfires, which it finally does, it's because too much grisly footage has been used too lightly."
"Thick with mold-breaking potential...the picture fails to break away from clownishly Goth-fashioned bloodsuckers and sunken-eyed, greasy-haired, heavy-metal headbanger-styled (werewolves)."
"While what Sérgio Vieira de Mello did was undoubtedly important, this film does little to make his life seem dramatic or even interesting. Its out-of-sequence narrative adds nothing."
...the filmmakers managed to mislay most of Mr. Wells' eloquent language and philosophical questions in favor of a simplified Classics Illustrated approach.
"You take the Will Ferrell formula and you plug it in, but somehow it just feels kind of uninspired and flat."
When a joke does land ... it's more a matter of luck than of craft.
The Snowman is a mess - but it is at least a fascinating one.
"Its heart is in the right place, but a reliance on gimmicks and sentiment undermines the story. In the end, both the laughs and the tears here come just a little too cheap."
"The on-court action is fairly bland, and photographed from all the wrong angles."
"As the movie keeps going, we cannot help but wonder what they were thinking. [Full review in Spanish]."
"An uneasy mix between Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and the The X-Files, and one not nearly as smart as either."
The director's mistake is wallowing in Liam Neeson's self-seriousness.
"It's a maudlin, superficial exercise in obsession masquerading as a heartfelt romance and study of grief, and character development is sorely lacking."
"The rhythms of the game feel right; the rhythms of the romance feel embarrassingly Harlequin, and the picture drags on for over two hours."
All you need is love... but a coherent vision doesn't hurt either.
"There's a subdued quality to watching golf as a spectator sport, and that same quality of reserved detachment applies to this golf movie."
"The script was co-written by McCarthy herself in collaboration with Steve Mallory, a pal from her Groundlings days, and her husband, actor-writer Ben Falcone, who directed the film, but it fails to give her anything like the nourishment she needs."
Long Shot has a few good laughs but they're not quite enough to make up for its broader shortcomings.
"If you've seen the trailer for Ride Along, then rest assured, you don't need to see the rest."
"The Vast of Night has a lot going for it: it has a lot of mood, a lot of tone, a lot of fancy camera work, a lot of long takes where actors can chew into a lot of dialogue. However, even with all of this muchness, the movie never really seems to elevate."
There can hardly be a bigger waste of time than this piece of twee nonsense.
"In the end, it's Salvo itself that's murky and obscure."
One of the most involuntarily laughable films I've seen to date. [Full review in Spanish] 
Koy and company bring some charisma to the table before the film eventually suffocates under its standard-issue design&#46; 
"Andy Fickman's indifferent direction only exemplifies the inefficient writing, which is inferior to the scribes' previous efforts, and too many plot points are glossed over in music montages."
"Fans of classical animation are hereby warned to steer clear of Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, for it will put them in instant vapor-lock and there aren't enough ambulances available this time of year."
Richard Fleischer's directing is as limp as the film's relentless attempts at comedy.
Inexplicably abysmal...
"There's some pleasant globe-trotting - Brazil to Thailand to Australia to Bulgaria - and a lot of over-the-top fights. But don't be surprised if after a few rounds, you find yourself wishing for the bell."
"The film is filled with hilariously bad performances, expository dialogue and production values that suggest it could have been a low-budget film-school project."
"Though Ilana Glazer delivers a solid performance, this pregnancy thriller ends up taking a predictable and unoriginal route. [Full Review in Spanish]"
All that drama in the tent and the weak attempt to make a love triangle happen doesn't work.
"What [Wes Craven] wound up with was a witless stab-the-teen time-waster that could be his worst film ever. And considering 2005's wretched Cursed, that's pretty bad."
Every scene in this movie plays like a scene from another boxing movie.
A mongrel marriage of frantic physical farce and sub-standard CGI work that turns out vaguely creepy rather than cute.
"It's as if the studio simply assembled a huge pile of money in the middle of the back lot, set it ablaze and started filming. And I wish they had, because it would have been more interesting to watch than this."
"Suffers from a limp story, but banks on good actors trying to make the best of the hand they've been dealt."
"In what kind of a sick world does a shark movie allow the majority of its cast to walk away unchomped? That'd be the world of Bait 3D, where almost all genre promises are broken, accents are in a constant state of flux, and everyone is the absolute worst."
"The film exploits Julia Roberts' role as a 'pretty woman,' whose prettiness is toyed with by the awful --yet eye-catching-- clothes she wears, and which glamorizes the character's less exciting qualities that drive the story."
You're not likely to get much of a rise out of The Center of the World.
Almost all the charm of the real story is lost through the contrivances and overacting.
"After three movies, The Expendables has collectively mustered less than a handful good setpieces, and...The Expendables 3, might contain the series' worst action to date."
"So much of it is designed to be crowd-pleasing, not go to deep. And that's sad, because here you have a figure where you can go real deep...too much of a TV movie."
"Some neat formal flourishes from its director Oliver Parker and a truly handsome supporting turn from Colin Firth, this story demands a more versatile and charismatic central player than the powerfully blank Ben Barnes."
The four leads are fine. This feels like a collective of Hollywood kids who got a lucky break on Bring Your Daughter to Work Day.
Guy Pearce (Mare of Easttown) struggles with a blue-collar Brooklyn accent while costar Matilda Lutz (Revenge) attempts to wrangle endless reams of expository dialogue in order to make this two-hander feel like something more than a double wank.
"Expect Jon Stewart to get sued for false advertising, because Irresistible is anything but."
"Liev Schreiber and Romola Garai struggle to find chemistry in their Mars rover, while Olivia Williams keeps her exasperation at full throttle."
"A tedious and simplistic celebration of the virtues of determination, Rudy is a film that prostrates itself before the carefully cultivated and shrewdly marketed myths surrounding Notre Dame football."
"Takers is a sterling example of how a movie can take a basic, appealing idea and turn it into something that you could easily watch while brushing your teeth, clipping your toenails, plucking your eyebrows."
Standing Ovation is an innovative film in the sense that every minute or so it comes up with a different way of being annoying.
"Olympia tries to impose order on a loosely shaped series of interviews with and about her dad via voice-over narration, but her trivial, self-absorbed musings only make the film seem more like an accomplished home movie than a serious documentary."
"Every bit as single-minded as its French-Canadian protagonist, pic drowns a potentially interesting story in careful literalism and elaborate period detail."
"The film's images evoke feelings in the viewer, not all of which are impatience. But impatience does accrue - not so much ""What's the point?"" as ""Get to the point."""
"Without Murray, the film would have much less appeal."
"Promising in ideas it suggests but ultimately can't effectively sell, it's a film which marks its director as one to watch given the opportunity to work in less contained, rigid environment."
Visual masterpiece with subtle nods towards mental health&#46; Watch for the nostalgia&#44; but don&apos;t expect this to be a Monstro whale of a movie&#46; There&apos;s a reason this movie went straight to streaming
"If only ""Jesus Is Magic"" had stuck with the jokes...she should leave the musical comedy to fellow New Hampshirite Adam Sandler"
I'm inclined to think that large and loud Batman v Superman is what happens when no limits are placed on a project.
"For the most part ... this is self-serious stuff, seething with ambition but almost devoid of spontaneity, and ultimately drained of genuine energy."
"Typically flat Schumacher effort--a lot of purple smoke, though"
"If this film were one of his students, Mr. Woodcock would have every reason to tell it to take another lap."
"As a Snake Eyes movie, it never felt like Snake Eyes onscreen."
Despite a nice family dynamic between the Langs and Pyms&#44; the lack of clarity around new villain Kang and the subpar visual effects make the film a lackluster addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe&#46;
"The actors are pure Hollywood, with every grin, spoken line, or sad face springing from acting classes and the closely studied performances of other actors."
"The bloated, unfocused and ludicrously U-turning script drags, and despite the lengthy running time, the story fails to give any character a satisfying arc."
"The movie just doesn't live up to the helmer's glorious sense of screen madness, more consumed with establishing ugliness than embracing the potential for a ripping medieval quest."
"The movie itself is frequently tiresome, moving around in such turgid circles of despair and ennui."
"""Pepper is solid as the lead actor."
[Resident Evil: Extinction] looks as if it has been lifted from the same genre of films.
"In the best traditions of the shopping experience, you might well be tempted to take Black Friday back and ask for a refund…"
At least this one is mercifully short&#46;
"The human element of ""Dune"" is dwarfed by the film's big ideas and even bigger canvas."

Red starts to devolve into nonsense well before it takes advantage of the many things it has going for it.
"It felt like a lot of ideas and they couldn’t pick the best ones.

A film that bores and feels like it never ends. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Gone is any semblance of narrative, replaced by a ramshackle psychodrama that takes a basic premise (man looking for his missing wife) and splinters off into multiple giallo-infused threads."
Erykah Badu is the best thing in House of D
'The Many Saints of Newark' commits a sin because it's better suited as a series.
"The animations are top-notch and social critique (literally 'chasing after money') compelling, but it just doesn't seem made for Chinese audiences."
Think about climbing a tree instead.
"Almost completely devoid of narrative tension or intriguing characters, The Statement is the surprisingly bad work of a normally reliable director."
"It feels rambling and pointless, but it's still somewhat entertaining."
Yesterday abandons its killer Beatles premise in favor of being a mediocre rom com.
"An attempt to be everything at once, which leaves it feeling like nothing but an empty mishmash of [the Russos'] favorite influences."
"A marginal entertainment with some greatly funny scenes definitely worth seeing, but is the rest of the movie worth wading through to get to them? Probably not."
Without a doubt one of the corniest movies I've ever seen
While its predecessor sold an otherwise preposterous idea with performances and psychological stakes that elevated the material&#44; the prequel reduces Esther to gimmicky schlock&#46;
"This sort of emotional-chaos-in-suburbia (it all takes place in Iowa) has been done well, of course, and at times it is here. But Lipsky's overly arch and tangential dialogue has too many curlicues, and everyone's emotions seem just this side of affected."
... more concerned with shallow period details than any meaningful moral complexity or contemporary resonance.
Adam Sandler's Eight Crazy Nights grows on you -- like a rash.
"I Love You, Man, which is like listening to a 105-minute conversation be tween Ross and Joey on Friends, looks like it might be a Judd Apatow movie in the same way Brett Favre, in a Jets uniform, looked like he might still know how to play quarterback."
"The film lacks what Garland, Lahr, Haley, Bolger, et al, had in abundance: humanity and charm."
"Attempts to create a joyous celebration of the strippers at play, but to hear them converse with one another or their targets of seduction is torture, leaving ""Magic Mike XXL"" primarily a visual event."
You've got to hand it to director Michael Lembeck... he's succeeded in persuading studio bosses to let him make not one but two sequels from premises that were dead in the water from the word go.
I hated this movie. It's a piece of junk.
"Babylon is a manic sprawl that only pretends to celebrate cinema. It’s really about prurience, dumb sensation, self-congratulation and willful ignorance of history."
"This slick but very dumb variation on Village of the Damned (complete with glowing eyes) is at once heavy-handed and ridiculous, in a conceptually lazy way suggesting the entire enterprise needed more adult supervision."
"In The Last Jedi, movie magic has been replaced by hocus pocus. Or perhaps even mumbo jumbo -- never has the eastern-western pop psychology of the franchise rung so hollow."
"If this 2019 version of Storm Boy, ... is supposed to honour the legacy of Colin Thiele's text, then one has to wonder whose dog Thiele ran over first."
"Why have a plot, characters, dialogue? Maybe the sequel will be called Simplistic: Bullets vs. Humans."
"A genre cheapie from its digital-video camerawork to its Casiotone soundtrack to its bland, buff cast, the movie is a cultural watershed in a dry gulch."
"While sweet and good-natured, it's also terribly slight and formulaic...as desperate to please the audience as its young performers are."
"In Wine Country, Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Rachel Dratch, Ana Gasteyer, Paula Pell, and Emily Spivey all seem to be having a blast, but the resultant movie is unfunny and forgettable."
"...ultimately nothing more than a silly, egregiously sentimental comedy..."
"A long, exhausting and pointless 111-minute exercise in red herrings, dead-end justifications and contrived horror situations."
"Bogdanovich co-wrote the script with (now ex-wife) Louise Stratten, and one gets glimpses throughout of the comic soufflé that the project wanted to be."
"The most self-important, heavy-handed film since...well, since DOGVILLE."
"Ponderous, maudlin tale of a seedy, dysfunctional Southern family"
These kind of films generally survive due to an intelligent use of special efffects. Rampage does not. [Full review in Spanish].
"Gwen lands in Serenity Glen, where recovering addicts sing ""Happy Trails To You"" in between participating in the cutest group therapy sessions you've ever seen. This might be where the Care Bears go for help if they fall off the wagon."
"A lazy, paceless lump of special effects and zero laughs"
"""Safe Haven"" plays out less like a love story than it does a two-hour audition tape Julianne Hough commissioned to land a lucrative lip-gloss-modeling contract."
"A lot of attractive people standing in for real-life nerds, and a plot that knows all the clichés and isn't afraid to use them."
"This sounds like a fun concept but unfortunately, Fatman never fully delivers because it focuses more on its not-so-exciting subplots."
little more than isolated--and not terribly fulfilling--masturbation
'Thirteen' is the kind of film (like the even-worse 'Kids') that will be described as 'shocking' and 'a wake-up call' by critics who haven't had any contact with actual kids since their own adolescence.
"It's a worryingly lenient and obtuse approach to history and historical evil, which are smothered in feelgood tragi-sentimental slush."
Maleficient&#58; Mistress of Evil could certainly be worse&#44; but that does not make it a good movie either&#46;
"Too dark for littl'uns, too hectic and cutesy for adults, it's pretty much guaranteed to please no one."
We witness a dumbing down of The Sorcerer's Apprentice as director Turteltaub and team seem to be fulfilling some quota of silliness
"Friedlander knows visual filmmaking, and only here does she shine. When time comes to address the secret lives of her dancing delinquents, the film grows two left feet."
"Lacks the fresh, zingy immediacy of Diablo Cody's other works."
It's like Ratatouille meets Upstairs Downstairs to go sort of cross-generational but it didn't work really on any level.
"... works best in its quieter, character-driven moments, which are overwhelmed by clichés and contrivances along the way."
Will make you jones for laughs and action.
"If his last days were really this banal, it's no wonder he killed himself."
"The moral of the story is that looks don't matter. But in animation, looks do matter, and even a sweet romance and fun tunes cannot overcome the clunkiness of its design."
"Director Nicholas Stoller doesn't do much to keep the movie from looking like what it is, a sloppy second helping that, for all its attempts to capture a 2016 zeitgeist, is really just more of the same."
Here everyone seems hemmed in by the director's lariat. Bidegain needs to learn how to let those wild horses run free.
American democracy has rarely looked worse than in this unfunny and undramatic comedy-drama.
I don't know why they did this.
"Critics find this glib Stephen Frears' confection a real rib-tickler but the crude, witless idiocy of it left me stony faced and irritated."
"Regardless of a distinct lack of romantic chemistry between Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo, the able-bodied actors fulfill the slapstick demands of this run-of-the-mill family comedy based on the 1968 movie with Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball."
The deviation of the story makes Jimenez's approach of Heydrich to lose solidity. [Full review in Spanish]
"[B]y the time its found its footing and a pace and energy that holds up to the flash, it's already the end."
"Perhaps expecting Bright to ask pertinent questions or think beyond its ""Orc is the New Black"" conceit was too much. As such, the limited world-building is just window-dressing for a basic survive-the-night thriller that putters along on toxic fumes"
Surely there's a promotion and commendation waiting for the one subordinate who's willing to report their activities.
"Without a clever script to back it up, the result feels like a much better fit for a slow day on Netflix than a full-price ticket to the theater"
How much longer can Statham keep afloat unremarkable action pictures? Will he ever burst out of his comfort zone and surprise us?
I was so irritated that I paid money to see this that I snuck into two movies afterward to feel better about my investment. Boooooooooring.
"Queen Latifah made a remarkably natural transition from hip-hop to acting. Such is not the case for rap star Common. Though he looks great on camera, his acting abilities are limited."
This film is neither controversial nor interesting enough to warrant much attention either way.
"I don't doubt that All Jacked Up and Full of Worms is trying to do something, and I suspect it might have hit on some useful approaches to the material...yet it's a party where a lot of people are having fun, and I wonder what I'm doing there."
"Laced with telegraphed character development, ghost-in-the-machine plot points, and preachy commentary, ""State of Play"" is a pedantic thriller caught in its own obvious clockwork."
"Andrea Arnold seems to be trying hard to emulate the hard edged work of her English realist masters, but she is selfish and uncaring about her audience"
"Perhaps because of its status as an overused commercial gimmick to get '80s adolescents into movie theaters, the slasher film has lost most of its luster. Sorority Row won't restore it, but it also won't tarnish it further."
"The film presents a new issue graver than juggling countless plots: A case of 'whose story, and in turn, whose character is central anyway?'"
...the film's inability to put a new spin on well-covered material... means the definitive work about this fascinating figure is yet to come.
"During an extended scatological sequence early in RV, the previously unthinkable becomes undeniable: Robin Williams is actually too dignified for some material. What he's required to do in this movie is beneath him, not to mention all over him."
"Location-shot without permission in Tokyo-Yokohama, this CinemaScope noir zooms in on touristy sights without capturing the nation's postwar trauma about to move into transformation."
Simply recounting the book's plot isn't enough to engage.
"The closest Suicide Squad comes to the masterworks of Christopher Nolan is that, like Memento, it suffers from instant amnesia."
"What we got was a decent film, but not one to carry the torch of the Star Wars legacy."
"...a romantic thriller devoid of romance, but it does thrill with the anticipation of how over the top the filmmakers' next move will be."
"Or, as more than a few IMDB reviewers have hinted: My Big Fat Swedish Wedding."
"It's not about pyrotechnics -- it's about the characters, doofus."
The film rarely takes us past its rather obvious conclusions about the potential bestial nature of kids and how that may translate to the larger battlefields.
". . .each of the movie's potential highs loses direction and intensity too soon to establish any foundation of empathy from the audience toward her, likable or not."

"If you stay with it, you do so by pretending you don't know how it ends and, moreover, that you care."
It was as bad as I thought it would be and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
"""Broken Hearts"" wends its way toward the foregone conclusion with a single-minded determination that is admirable, if not exactly unexpected."
It's a movie that's more concerned with striking poses than telling a story or delivering even one exciting action sequence.
"All you need to know about this movie is that 'I hate Mondays,' Garfield's memorable comic strip punch line, is way funnier when Puss-in-Boots utters it in Shrek 2."
full review at Movies for the Masses
"There is a dark but funny, likable but truthful movie that could be made from this material, maybe even with the same cast. But best efforts or not, The Dilemma isn't quite it."
My own reaction to the current version fashioned by Mr. Schumacher is one of pure stupefaction.
"In contrast to Rudd and Carell's previous efforts, ""Dinner for Schmucks,"" directed by Jay Roach of ""Meet the Fockers"" fame, is almost two hours of weightless, often witless silliness with Carell doing an uninspired half-wit, holy-fool routine."
"Although Sinister 2 continues the story begun in Scott Derrickson's creepily effective Sinister, it feels more like an unnecessary retread than an organic extension of the original."
"Torn between moody grandiosity and cartoonish mayhem, Daredevil tries to have it both ways, and succeeds at neither."
"Director Anton Corbijn has admirably captured the tenor and flavor of John le Carré's long, boring, wordy books by translating his 2008 novel into a long, boring, wordy movie worth seeing only to view McAdams cavort in the tightest jeans in movie history."
The Visitor is a terrible film.
"Like the character that shares its name, Sandy Wexler means better than his peers, but it needs better management if it's going to work."
"As movies go, it's wholly predictable, occasionally and intentionally dull, and apparently quite lazy."
"Only glimpses of the monster are seen in Stephen Kay's supernatural thriller. Unfortunately, the same is true of the movie's plot and character."
Shawn Levy's comedy-drama about a grieving American family is too smug and sanctimonious to take advantage of its top-notch cast.
"You would think that after three films, Bay would find some groove with this material. If anything, he's regressed."
"He does, however, leave the door open for a sequel. But who'd want to clone a runt?"
evokes the meaninglessness of trying to find morals in war
"In the end, Morris's attempts to explore the boundaries of humour is exploded by a lethal combination of furtive political correctness and transparently terrible taste."
"Once departing, there's no turning back from a bloated two hours, a convoluted story, goony wooden characters, and endless action that feels weightless."
"It's all pleasant, mildly amusing, and mostly of interest to fans of the radio show. Others may find it less than riveting."
"There’s enough sex and violence here to hold attention for an hour and a half, but the care or conviction to explain why it all happens — let alone why viewers should care — proves elusive."
"It's apparent that the story doesn't drive this sequel; it's so repetitive in ideas and imagery that, like the second picture, it's as much a remake as it is a follow-up."
An example of how good intentions don't necessarily make for a good movie.
"France has every reason to be smug about its cultural heritage, but the nation has developed a terribly pious way of commemorating its great and good in biopics."
"Less acceptable is that it's a good hour before The Informer kicks into gear as a gripping prison break thriller, by which time, if you're streaming it, you'll have switched off or snoozed off."
Seyfried shows she's not the kind of actress who would be an easy victim in a Scream movie.
Supporting characters are sometimes best left as just that.
"There's nothing actually wrong with Despereaux, but there's nothing all that right with it either."
"A parade of creepy animated baby effects or almost equally disturbing CGI dog effects, all of which smack more of manic desperation than even passing inspiration."
Will dance triumph over adversity? Will love between two attractive vacuous actors conquer all?
"It's not just that this fable about a picked-on kid whose dreams come true is an excruciatingly dumb kids' movie. It's that it returns us to the bad old days of 3D, when the images were rendered too murky to appreciate."
Even if it were pretty good - which it's not - Righteous Kill would fall a distant third in the rankings of films in which Al Pacino and Robert De Niro both appeared.
"The whole problem with ""Sex Tape"" in a sentence: After its first third, the two lead characters just run around trying to prevent something that the audience very much wants to see happen."
"The film's potential is still visible, but despite an all-star cast and beautiful cinematography, its execution falls woefully flat."
"Pointless, purile sequel to a not-outstanding film. Avoid."
"For a movie based entirely around a beat-the-clock goal, there's no real momentum here."
"A slice of retro whimsy, it's rooted to nothing in particular and is inoffensive in every way except its overwhelming blandness."
Netflix's Death Note fails Asian-Americans in the more mundane way that most Hollywood releases continue to .
"dyskoleyetai na kratisei ypo elegho toys melodramatismoys tis, kai sto deytero miso tis se krataei men me sfigmena ta heria ap' tin agonia, katorthoma, omos, poy den eimai sigoyros oti einai kai toso dyskolo, otan s' ehei paei os ekei me ta sagonia tentom"
It says nada about Broadway that hasn't been said better many times before.
"Based on the video game franchise of the same title, Hitman exploits every action-flick clich imaginable and still manages to be dull."
"A gooey, tiresome bore, unconvincing in its lesbian relationship and deeply silly when it tries for big comic moments."
"With its Stygian production design and Bovril-on-the-lens aesthetic, the film works so hard to make an ordinary Bronx day feel like hell, you'll wonder what's left for the afterlife."
It's rumored the actors were paid for this. You don't need to.
"If you truly love yourself, do yourself a favour and avoid this spiritless comedy."
"The film quickly devolves into undifferentiated shooting, yelling, and exploding."
"The film isn't any uglier than its antecedents, but it is more lethargic."
"There's nothing scary here. Nothing interesting. Nothing notable. Unless you need a nap, skip it."
"The Ant Bully is a sore disappointment to anyone hoping for a turnaround to the recent downward quality spiral of animated films. In fact, this movie may represent a new nadir for 3D animation."
Kassim the Dream's aestheticization of human despair is nearly obscene.
"Far from amounting to anything at all, except a fretless exercise in low-altitude farce."
"In the end, the film doesn't add up to much of anything, but its individual parts are sometimes greater than its whole."
"Dark, with jaw-dropping effects, stunning action beats and a chase to end all chases, The Matrix Reloaded is a movie-going dare."
"Their spy-prying...and displays of lunkheaded brawn...aren't endearing; they're horrifying, in ways there's no coming back from. [Blu-ray]"
Ms. Bullock as the aggressive brute and Ms. McCarthy as the straitlaced go-getter would have challenged these easy stereotypes and made them a tad less insulting to successful career women everywhere.
"Everything, Everything isn't without intelligence or charm, but just because a film is set in a sanitised environment doesn't mean that it should look or feel as antiseptically, oppressively pastel as this."
Parental Content Review
"Though the film benefits from an easy chemistry between the leads, it never hits any of the highs hinted at early on, leaving audiences unfulfilled by the possibility of what might have been."
"keeps viewers guessing, provides several solid jolts, builds to a perfectly acceptable ending -- then can't resist adding on a few more twists that finally push the picture dangerously close to the border of unintentional comedy."
"If there were any new ideas, I failed to spot them, as did my bone marrow, which slept through most of it anyhow."
"It has Kevin Bacon. How bad could it be? Bacon makes everything better, whether it be a cheesy movie or a cheeseburger! I'll never think that again as this movie becomes more absurd by the moment."
"This film should be enjoyable enough for children, but will perhaps be not quite enough to enthuse their parents"
"There isn't an emotional connection to the people or actions taking place on screen, and while I was impressed with some of the performances and filmmaking the film as a whole left me cold."
"'A vivid and dazzling depiction of the Cuban landscape and culture but also a weak plot that barely supports the intricate, detailed visuals.'"
"Proving that 2009's The Hangover was a fluke, this sequel returns to filmmaker Todd Phillips' more usual mean-spirited style"
After appearing together in Charlie Wilson&#8217;s War&#44; Hanks and Roberts reunite and display plenty of chemistry in this rather plain&#44; unpretentious&#44; but somewhat uninvolving romantic comedy&#46;
"Once again, Tim Burton ruins the Batman series with overly-campy crap. Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman is the only saving grace."
"Stella is, in the end, foiled by a host of negative attributes that conspire to cement the movie's place as a seriously dull little drama."
Barely memorable.
Baby Mama's principal issue is in not being written by Fey.
"A slight sex comedy that would work far better on stage than screen, where it seems far too talky and too slow."
Just go rewatch the Coors Light twins commercial if you need a clone fix. It has more depth and pathos than this mess.
"Kate Winslet does a syrupy voice-over to this bedtime story, but given what we know of foxes, it's a tough one to swallow."
"It offers a few solid laughs and will provoke some smiles, but there's too much of a tendency to go for obvious, largely unfunny humor when something more subtle would have satisfied."
"Once upon a time there were these things called movies and they told stories. Then Hollywood made so much money from branding, licensing and merchandising that they stopped telling stories and just started chucking stuff at the screen."
"That sound you hear is John Hughes and Harold Ramis, the writer and director of the original, rolling over in their graves. And not from laughter, which is in very short supply here."
It's as if the American hip-hop culture has been fully lost in Japanese translation and skewed as something cartoonish.
"Jennifer Lopez plays a middle-aged woman trying to break out of her dull life, a storyline that may sound like it has potential but, in this case, goes nowhere."
"The longer the film gets, the less sense it makes."
The formal mechanisms are so obvious and impersonal that they flatten our modes of thinking and feeling almost as much as the propaganda films that a regime like East Germany's would have approved.
Making every single murderer and rapist into a sympathetic character is going way too far.
"Turns out it's harder to make a Fast & Furious movie than Dwayne Johnson thinks. Plays like a standard, mid-range The Rock or Statham movie, & Hollywood wastes Elba again..."
"It's wretchedly unfunny and tonally erratic, the striking production design notwithstanding."
Should make a sound addition to the libraries of women-centric TV outlets where such fare suitably appeals to the demographic.
"passable entertainment, but still trite and superficial"
Ain't Them Bodies Saints doesn't live up to crime dramas it mimics
The First Wives Club poses as a male-bashing feminist tract but is in fact a female-bashing exercise in misogyny and self-loathing.
"There are some good points, but there are too many ineffectual aspects that keep I Am Legend from being the sophisticated film it was clearly meant to be."
"As hypnotic as the animation is, it distracts from the film's clear problems."
"Godard has made a film whose title translates into Our Music, but he fails to realize that the band is playing only for him."
"Orbiting her like vague moons are three young men-her concerned husband, her cagey boss at the dispensary, and an adenoidal young admirer-most of whom seemed as puzzled by the situation as I was."
"Slow and frustrating, with a finale that is unearned, Red Rocket fluctuates between trying to say something and getting lost in its own premise."
"A film of repetition, a bloody dance consisting of three steps: stab, scream, repeat."
"A lovingly acted film that, unfortunately, derails in the third act..."
A progressively ineffective thriller...
"Because I Said So is a work of comic desperation, and an especially cruel betrayal of Keaton, who looks radiant in her 60s yet keeps finding herself cast in roles that use her age as the foundation for cut-rate slapstick."
The story seems to have enough momentum to carry itself through to the end - but by the movie's final scene - the wind has left its sails.
"With Bahrani's assured direction squaring off against his ragged script, this proves to be a mixed bag of a movie, maybe worth seeing for reduced admission but not necessarily at any price."
Doesn't punch nearly as hard without Coogler in its corner.
This is The Last Stand: be grateful for small blessings.
It makes Kindergarten Cop and Bringing Up Baby sparkle in comparison.
What might have been an African-American gangland epic with a killer soundtrack treads safely as a run-of-the-mill biopic.
This is jaw-droppingly juvenile and insulting to my intelligence. Perhaps its subject matter is obsolete. Asimov deserved better.

"It's been 18 years since ""Twister,"" which means it's high time for another tornado movie, right? Be careful what you wish for."
"Even if you are rooting for this film to succeed, you find yourself sitting through the tear-jerking part of the movie without feeling terribly wrapped up in it."
"A family-oriented heartstring-yanker so syrupy-sweet in its depictions of the game, angels, orphans, children's wishes, and estranged parents, that it may be all you can do to keep from taking a Louisville Slugger to the projectionist."
"Seeking a comeback, Harman Baweja is given a stubble and an unsympathetic father and a misunderstood childhood. Despite all of this, he leaves as little impact as he has before."
Might as well be called My Big Fat Greek Package Holiday.
"What makes this film old is Anthony Hopkins and his laboured transformation into a tortured being, who needs to be tied up hand and foot, there to snarl and growl.We've seen this Hopkins before, better done in his man-eating Hannibal Lecter role."
"In fact, ""Quid Pro Quo"" is not at all funny, merely occasionally sarcastic, its plot a succession of half-baked pop-psych speculations and its dialogue a glib sampling of sub-Diablo Cody incredibility"
"An incredible cast inexplicably stars in a poorly thought-out, low-budget neo-noir from filmmakers with no clout or even discernible past success. What, were they blackmailed?"
"Sure, affable nice guys will do extreme things when threatened, but going from a sweet and doting schlub to a one-shot-killing henchmen destroyer gets really implausible in a hurry."
Fails to resonate with anything more than the quotidian rhythms of a uniquely dysfunctional family.
Unforgivably slow and over-titled attempt to dramatize the ignoble murder of the notorious outlaw features a fine performance by Casey Affleck as Ford.
"The sweetness is better than the comedy, but we are not overly swamped with either."
At best it's a delicate omage to a moving piece of romanticism rather than a notable entry into the genre.
"There's no denying the appeal to action fans of seeing Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, and Chuck Norris in the same scene together."
"Too bad the rest of the movie isn't as captivating as the big, beautiful cat at its center."
Preposterous on an epic scale
"Even putting aside the basic filmmaking issues the movie has, where The Mummy suffers is trying to kickstart an entire universe in one film."
"It's missing the point to note that the patriotism on display in '2012' is embarrassingly shallow, as are Emmerich's genuflections to the value of faith. This is not a movie of ideas, but one of visceral thrills. On that level it's hardly inspired."
"Ultimately, a collage film is only as good as its constituent parts, and, with a few exceptions, the brief snippets from this particular day on earth are far too prosaic to be illuminating."
I'm beginning to suspect that Basinger's Academy Award winning turn in LA. Confidential was a fluke.
"This Southern Gothic story is overwrought and, despite its beautifully decayed deep South setting and flawed characters who might be interesting underneath all their angst, is actually kind of boring."
"An adaptation of Cinderella that seems to actively take issue with the source material. There's some cute moments here and there, but overal a misfire that underutilizes it's most talented cast members."
"While you may laugh here and there, if you wait for the DVD you can skip the slow sections for the high points."
Has the feel of a film that was probably more fun to make than it is to watch.
"As a silly thriller, it's forgivable. As a satire, it's a complete whiff."
Right at Your Door is a tick-tock of post-apocalyptic paranoia and moral ambiguity that would have made for some taut psychodrama on The Twilight Zone.
Perhaps the filmmakers deserve credit for their one show of restraint: No jokes in this movie have been made at the expense of Justin Bieber.
"Ryan seems to be having fun, at least: she speaks with a breathy working-class accent that's part Lauren Bacall, part Teamster."
"Survivors is a truly awful mix of bad direction, nonsensical story line and dialogue that appears to have been made up on the spot."
"A heavily eroticised Arterton enlivens the lumpy Franglais dialogue and Luchini wrings laughs from the unlovely vantage of voyeuristic saddo. But that's not enough to hold the film together, or, indeed, the viewer's interest."
Alone Together strives to be a part of the Covid movie collection&#46; Sadly nobody wants to relive that&#46; Better to just keep it on lockdown&#46;
"If there's a police code it merits, it's a ""10-22"": ""Disregard."""
"The movie is so jam-packed and busy that it's essentially an origin story, a coming-of-age story, a science fiction film, a superhero movie, an alien invasion, and a disaster movie all bumping into each other."
The graveyard for movie comedy sequels just got a bit more crowded.
"The plotting takes bizarre detours into the realm of science-fiction, but Ponsoldt insists on shooting it with the granola aesthetic of a Sundance also-ran about a family farm. He's an astonishingly wrong choice for this material."
[Mark Waters] has pretty well delivered just what young PG-13 girls carrying that extra pack of Kleenex will expect.
Squanders the cross-cultural comedy potential of a Jewish-themed Christmas movie on cheap fart gags and boilerplate schmaltz.
[It's] trying to add a feminist twist to the spate of Britain's bloody gangster thrillers and never quite succeeding.
It feels incomplete and the ending is entirely too convenient. We've seen all of this before.

"At the end of the day though, this film simply didn't cut it as a full-blown summer action thriller..."
A disjointed script fails to link different episodes in their lives or forge an emotional connection with these deeply troubled girls.
"Despite its intelligence, it's dreary and uninvolving, more an exercise in style than an act of love."
"Functions more as a slice of teen life narrative than a coming-of-age story, as its characters never grow enough to fulfill the demands of the latter genre."
"The pacing is far too quick, yet the movie's runtime comes in over two hours. Hellboy overcomplicates a fairly straightforward story in the process."
It comes off feeling more like promising studio outtake than a polished final track.
One suspects the slash-and-burn Miike of old might have scoffed at [13 Assassins].
This is easily the worst filmed version of anything penned by the prolific author.
"Lurching from admirably frank, multifaceted depictions of human physical and psychological survival to scenes so hokey they're almost surreal, the movie is like a thoroughbred horse without a jockey -- a thing of beauty running nowhere."
"While the heroes of DreamWorks' film claim to be the guardians of childhood, their tattooed, hoodied posturing actually diminishes it."
"Sarah Koskoff's screenplay is flagrantly duplicitous, introducing the heroine as a self-pitying sloth, then trying to pass her off as likable by making nearly all the other characters drips, snobs, or unfeeling scolds."
"While The Messenger feeds our appetite for visual panache, it starves the soul."
A comedy that is as lame in its storytelling as it is in its physical execution.
"If -- like the filmmakers and star Jessica Alba -- you're over 14 years old, it seems impossible that you could get through Honey with a straight face."
The strength they showed by managing to sit through this thing puts that of Herc to shame.
"A pretty zappy effects showcase, weighed down by a protracted, soul-challenged Frankenstory that short-circuits every time it gets moving."
"Alas, an expletive and N-word laced descent into modern minstrelsy."
'French Exit' loses its way.
It makes me feel cheated and sad.
"Like so many post-Val Lewton horror films, this 1992 feature starts out promisingly while the plot is mainly a matter of suggestion, but gradually turns gross and obvious as the meanings become literal and unambiguous."
"A typical episode of Law and Order is less ridden with cliché (which is saying something, given that the series is about as formulaic as it gets) and more satisfying."
"Miss Lovely sets out to prove that Indian cinema can be as rambling, pretentious and frustratingly opaque as a European art movie. It succeeds rather too well."

The title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you'll read anywhere.
"The filmmakers seem not to understand the difference between a social error and sexual assault, which is deeply depressing."
Weak plotting and sluggish direction (by Joey Klein) bury his increasing peril in a story that emphasizes the dead-end chaos of lives controlled by cravings.
The weakest of the three&#46; It fails at taking its own emotional logic that seriously&#59; the drama is embarrassingly schmaltzy and the humor hacky&#46; Feels like a parody of itself&#46;
"Moments of genuine tension are few in this would-be suspenseful thriller, which can't settle on a state of mind for its protagonist, or for its own story."
"There's a level of brutal, boring stupidity here that makes The A-Team look like it was written by Sun Tzu. It's all a big joke. Except it isn't in the least bit funny."
"...anyone looking for a believable plot will have to...scour the multiplex for something more realistic, like, say, Sin City or The Amityville Horror..."
A film about people who feel too much for people who don't think too much.

"Bigger, louder and considerably less charming than its predecessor."
"Director Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day,"" ""The Equalizer"") has never been accused of subtlety, so the depth of performances he achieves here are noteworthy even if the story beats come down like a sledgehammer."
Rob Cohen's half-baked erotic thriller plays like a misguided homage to Eighties video fare and to family-in-peril sagas like Unlawful Entry or Cape Fear.

"Frankly, if you believe this twaddle, you'll believe anything, and if you believe anything, you don't need to go to the films -- you can just sit at home and fantasise for free."
"I had hoped, I guess, that the film would do justice to the book, but sadly that is not the case. If I were you, go out and spend the money on the paperback, curl up and give yourself over to the wacky world Burroughs' creates. It'll be more fulfilling th"

"If you're looking for comedy to be served up, better look elsewhere."
"Despite all of its well-intentioned, high-minded aspirations, Strangerland is a hodgepodge that plods along at a torpid pace."
"Lazily written and poorly directed, this is a disappointing, derivative and largely laugh-free comedy that never quite answers the question of why anybody needed a Johnny English sequel in the first place."
A bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of self-importance...
This is one more 'youth movie' that'll put years on anyone over 25.
"When ""Grudge Match"" pokes fun at the fight film genre, it lands some comic blows. It eventually loses the battle on points, though, when the more serious story lines get in the way."
You know a movie is not worth the celluloid it's printed on when the only clever or even remotely original thing about it is its release date.
Brown ... doesn't create satirical sex comedies so much as etiquette guides out of Dale Carnegie or Anthony Robbins.

All you can see are a pair of aging jocks laboring for condescending yuks
"As handsomely constructed as the wooden vessel on which it's largely set, yet dramatically choppy as the ocean its protagonists set out to conquer, In the Heart of the Sea feels like the most workmanlike adaptation of its ambitious story possible."
"Somehow more cartoonish than Disney's version, which actually was a cartoon."
Too often this version feels like a bunch of sketches cobbled together and united by their love of dirty punchlines.
Sometimes the whole is less than the sum of the parts.
The movie appears to have been made for an audience that considers the idea of black people terribly exotic.
Simply a series of strained set-pieces that rely on old tropes and celebrity cameos.
"Either reinvent or stick to the source material, don't try to have your fun both ways. It doesn't work."
"Such an average, uneventful, small, intimately-designed, down-to-earth, slice-of-life drama that very little of it is memorable."
Robin Williams is given no room to stretch. He's stuck mooning over a romance that will bore youngsters.
"The decision to film the major set-pieces in extreme close-up was ill-advised, and these murky and incoherent bits are further crippled by obvious CGI as well as rapid-fire editing that recalls those Ginsu blades in action on late-night infomercials."
Rise of the Silver Surfer is an existentially and aesthetically unnecessary sequel to the equally irrelevant if depressingly successful Fantastic Four.
"Many times I admired it for its craft, its game performances, its deft way with suspense... Yet by the time Hateful Eight was over, that admiration was overshadowed by its lazy cynicism disguised as western revisionism."
"Chameleonic actor Jake Gyllenhaal's light heavyweight boxing champ Billy ""the Great"" Hope can take on any contender... But when he faces the greatest heavyweight boxing clichés in movie history, he goes down for the count."
This wannabe thriller about the new techno industry is a misfire.

Holy Spider doesn&#8217;t add up to a fully realized thriller&#46;
"Because I Said So isn't very funny, and no amount of having Diane Keaton act all post-menopausally zany is going to create the tension that just isn't there."
"Trite, labored, and much too nice."
A star this good deserves a better movie.
"Dodgy mixture of cutesy romance, dark satire and murder mystery."
A basic feature...  the premise is diluted in a variation of Book Club.  [Full review in Spanish] 
The screenplay quickly loses this moral clarity as the plot twists pile up and the power balances shift.
"Making a parable out of the Holocaust is a dicey proposition, and here the emotional tugs are so forced that it exploits and trivializes the historical tragedy it claims to be trying to illuminate."
"Sorely missing is a feeling of immediacy or urgency, undercut by bad dialogue and eye-rolling coincidence."
So gloriously ridiculous and fast moving that you keep trying to convince yourself that the filmmakers were making a parody. They had to be. Right?
"The result is a picture of considerable vision (this is a Spike Jonze film), but one that feels still-born. It traipses from one set-piece incident to the next without gathering much imaginative power, and it's low on thrills."
"Hard as the two actors strive for lovable eccentricity, they emerge as irritating oddities."
Love and Other Drugs is a sort-of romantic comedy about erectile-dysfunction drugs and Parkinson's Disease. Because Lord knows you can't make a romantic comedy that's just about erectile dysfunction.

"Now that this stupendously inept serial-killer flick has slithered into theaters, the diminutive legend had better clear room in his closet for another cinematic skeleton."
"The line between shining a light and exploitation can be blurry, and Small World definitely crosses it."
"A muddled, self-serious snoozer."
"The results are occasionally moving and heartfelt, but delivered with a milquetoast distance that mutes some of the film's uplift."
"If you thought Elizabeth: The Golden Age was over the top, just wait until you get a load of how her mother is portrayed in this risible soap opera."
"Branagh runs through all of this efficiently enough, but it feels awfully familiar."
[The filmmakers'] choices make this would-be redemption narrative feel unfortunately and uncomfortably exploitative.
Live By Night is the weakest work of Ben Affleck's trajectory as a director and not even the good cast that backs it manages to get the movie going. [Full review in Spanish]
"By the time the seemingly endless climax rolls around, John Wick has confirmed its place as a generic actioner..."
A horrifically terrifying film-going experience - to be sure. A horrifically terrifying film? No way.
"At times the film is charming against its own will, but it remains needlessly complicated and obsessed with its own mythology and metaphors."
"The Walk is split into two disparate halves - the half Robert Zemeckis passionately wanted to make, and the half he had to make in order to end up with a complete film."
an unintentionally funny disaster
Uneven origin story is disappointing; expect some violence.
"For a man motivated as much by a craving for excitement as cash, the picture about his life is, ironically, a yawn."
It is literally a visual companion to the spin-off album of a computer-generated remake of a 1994 cartoon.
Calling a sequel Are We Done Yet? is like calling it Enough Already.
"More humdrum than fascinating, the film is nothing more than a soppy teen-pleaser."
"Revolutionary Road offers nothing you can't see on TV, with more compelling narratives and better performances (save for Michael Shannon)."
"There is not a laugh to be found in this rancid, misogynistic revenge comedy."
"Brilliantly rendered as a phantasmagoria of digital-bubblegum sci-fi, exploding with color and action. And yet, you'll be hard pressed to give a damn about any of it."
"Unexpected features fine performances from both women and I'd love to see more from newcomer Bean, showing grace and maturity onscreen."
Dark Shadows really is just a mixed bag of chuckles and drama that never really gets the balance quite right.
"As far as I'm concerned, Angels & Demons is the first bona fide dud of the 2009 summer movie season. A typical walk up the aisle to receive communion is more exciting than this movie."
"Timeline fails to grab you and sustain any feeling of wonder. The time travel is treated so matter of factly ... that it, too, cannot stir the imagination."
"It's all lifeless material that might have been saved by the leads' charms, but as it turns out, they have none."
"Might as well be called ""So I Married a Sociopath."""
"""Harsh Times"" is a tragedy whose finale is obvious right from the start."
"Walking With Dinosaurs 3D is about as dumbed-down as nature cinema can get (at least their lips don't move), made even worse by stereotyped male-female roles that really do hearken back to the Stone Age."
"A movie with long patches of interpretive quiet, Millennium Mambo is often pretty to look at, but needs a little more to say."
"I wasn't scared, amused, or otherwise peripherally entertained in any way by Wish Upon."
"Attempts to be a complicated dissection of a possible world not too far ahead of us, but it lacks the imagination to make us soar along with its vision."
&#8220;Smile&#8221; feels like listening to someone shout the &#8220;hidden meaning&#8221; of a knock-knock joke&#46; &#8220;YOU GET IT&#63; BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO SAY BANANA AGAIN&#33; BUT I SAID ORANGE&#44; WHICH IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF FRUIT&#33;&#8221;
"It's not all a total loss... if you like the two stars (I do), you'll love them here..."
Brilliant performances by all involved are about the only things that remain consistent.
A promising start that quickly evolves into a convoluted mess of blood and gore.
Bateman and McCarthy are asked to mine a garbage heap of gags
A middling entertainment.
This is another entry that fails to muster excitement or move things forward in a meaningful way&#46; It just exists &#8211; a gear in a moneymaking machine that is starting to lose its steam&#46;
A machine built for screaming speed and excitement that only ever just cruises through the suburbs at half speed.
"What We Did On Our Holiday just doesn't do or say that much, and what it does accomplish is fine at best. Oh, we should all be nicer to each other? That's the whole point of this disjointed thing? Yeah. OK."
So much of the novel's reckless atmosphere is missing...
"They took the lousy Soderbergh/Clooney template for Ocean's Eleven, Twelve and Thirteen and intentionally made this stinker."
"... a big, boiling MacGuffin stew of a movie, a Hitchcockian experiment in audience manipulation that slaps its artificiality in your face like a gold G-man's shield."
"[Beowful is] a bizarre hybrid, as strange (if not quite as ghastly) as the half-human, half-demon Grendel that haunts the first act."
"As the characters begin to openly suffer, the movie becomes a grueling record of their pain and fear. It ultimately feels futile as well as pointlessly punishing."
"Martin's soul is for sale, dirt cheap."
"Does the positive energy of a female-centric comic book movie-made by women-compensate for the nihilistic, super-violent nature of its content? Is this really a step forward for women, behind the camera and in the audience? That's the conundrum presented"
"Rock can't really be expected to pull off the love scenes, but for a man trying to reach the largest possible audience, his comedy is surprisingly uninspired."
"Much of it feels like 'Nation's Pride,' the Nazi propaganda pastiche screened during the climax of 'Inglourious Basterds.'"
Murray's performance really is one of very few saving graces in this truly underwhelming piece of cinema.
A breathtakingly bad Altman rip-off that seems like a wholly unintentional parody of multi-narrative films.
"If this Dracula can kill hundreds of enemies by himself - and he can, and does, in several dull and protracted battle scenes - then where's the suspense? If he's become a monster for noble reasons, then where's the dark conflict?"
"Bizarre can be good when it's done deftly. In this case, however, it's done ponderously and sententiously."
Hyams is hoping that the newfangled wall-climbing swordplay will compensate for the inexperience of the young and relatively unknown cast members populating most of the central roles. It doesn't.
Just can't quite keep its pilot light burning.
"Propelling us from one shag-pile, Silk-Cut orgy to the next, High Rise becomes the film people who don't like Ken Russell describe when they explain why they don't like Ken Russell."
"Comes across as a pretty ordinary mob drama with a curiously flat protagonist, totally lacking the resonance of something like the 'Godfather' saga."
Stereotypes across the board&#44; puerile one-upmanship games&#44; and an utter failure to explain why&#44; indeed&#44; these two even were together&#46;
It's completely pointless.
"The bottom line is that Vampire in Brooklyn is funny and gross, but saddled with a pedestrian storyline that denies any real magic in its premise and sinks its potential as a dark fantasy."
"Pokes fun at a program that doesn't take itself seriously, cutting down easy targets like an eighth-grade bully picking fights with first graders."
"This movie is composed in the increasingly familiar international hectic-mosaic style, with a note of justified paranoia."
"While Louis-Dreyfus fares well with the smaller moments, Ferrell doesn't quite convince with a performance that's forever threatening to break out into his more familiar showboat shtick."
It's hard not to watch the Wimpy Kid movies through webbed fingers.
It's not asking much that a thriller be scary or shocking. This one waffles between being predictable and absurd.
"A fairy tale concept enlivened with average special effects, a plight predicated upon purportedly epic affection rendered with the most rote and unearned of emotion, and a tale supposedly larger-than-life but lacking in enthusiasm or investment."
...it is all very predictable without the heart that the American Pie crew offered...
This is strictly dull chuckles from dull wits.
"Tessa and Chris might glow like radium, but Men in Black: International is an inert gas, fleeting and faint."
...exhausting and mind-numbing.
"There's never quite been a movie like Sick, which isn't interesting enough, alas, to make its repellent and morbid episodes bearable."
"If you want a film with intrigue, murder, and women in love, skip Lizzie and watch Park Chan Wook's ""The Handmaiden."""
"What's most difficult about Sorkin's intricate fantasy is not acknowledging Jobs' darkness, but setting aside all hope of seeing the real man who inspired it."
This limp comedy is never as nasty as it ought to be.
"Both leads offer a diminished shtick, Witherspoon flustered and prim, Vergara flogging her zany Latina firecat routine from Modern Family."
"Ultimately, Sliding Doors becomes a victim of its own cleverness, shutting down all that early promise."
"Pic ultimately has nothing of any real depth or profundity to say, but a thousand self-consciously complex ways of saying it."
They&#47;Them is a baffling production&#44; and seems almost frightened of its own rich ideas and unwilling to tie them to decades of slasher pics that played fast and loose with gender stereotypes and sexuality&#46;
"What was really clicking in a sort of Albert Brooks meets Woody Allen sort of way suddenly runs out of steam, the laughs still there just now fewer and much further between."
"Utterly devoid of suspense, energy or credibility."
Will Robin Williams ever divorce himself from the unholy union of silliness and sentimentality?
"Jeremy Podeswa's tremulous adaptation of Anne Michaels's novel aches with earnest intent and tasteful eroticism, yet it moves as heavily and lugubriously as a prison gate."
"It's an overlong, arduous caper, drawn from the work of thriller writer Donald E. Westlake much as a patient's tooth might be extracted with much banter and minimal anaesthesia."
"If you don't look up at him, maybe he'll go back inside."
When one of your best sequences involves Maryanne Trump giving a speech putting down government handouts&#44; with her proud father standing to the side watching her&#44; I think you have to assume something is broken within the inner-workings of your film&#46;
Basically a continually-shrinking bunch of tourists running around trying to find their way out of a Ukrainian ghost land. Fascinating.
"As for movie fans, if a poker tournament strikes you as a really uncinematic setting for a drama and you can't imagine what the filmmakers can do to make it a little more watchable...well, alas, they don't have too many ideas on that score, either."
THE ASSISTANT is mind-numbingly slow and ultimately unsatisfying.
The Wayward Cloud finds Ming-liang in a rut and unable to elevate his neon wilderness to the heights of the rest of his consistently fascinating oeuvre.
"How to Be Single gets some things right - relationships are messy - but despite the lesson of the title, this film reverts to standard rom-com, the result of either a lack of conviction or just wanting to tell women what they want to hear."
"A good story lurks somewhere in ""Queenpins,"" but Gaudet and Pullapilly take the easy way out at every plot point and with nearly every joke."
A peculiar combination of dutiful recreation and souped-up Hollywood disaster movie.
"Run is a film so full of half-measures that you begin to wonder if it wouldn't be better off as Trot, or maybe Jog or Power Walk."
It gets old fast.
The problem here is not so much that there's no explanation for what's happening to her as that the filmmakers haven't figured out what to do about it.
"While it's refreshing to see a scary movie that's not about torture and dismembered corpses, that's not enough."
[VIDEO] Sharing only a smidgen of a resemblance to the legendary storyline of Shakespeare's tragedy this animated children's movie is an abomination by any standard.
"If ever there was a movie that could cause even the most restless sleeper to fall into a deep slumber, this is it."
"Part labored farce and part Cinderella story, this one-joke comedy stretches a thin premise to feature length."
Light mainstream feature has enough charisma and cultural observations -- but only just
The last half of the film finds it derailing into a standard and frankly uninteresting thriller.
Uma produo repleta de obviedades.
"There's nothing like a good romantic comedy. Which brings to mind Laws of Attraction, which is nothing like a good romantic comedy."
The history is frustratingly conveyed and the emphasis is out of whack in this disappointing effort.
"The ending is a disappointment, so arbitrary that it seems to come simply because the film has gone on for as long as [director Joe] Penna cared for it to last."
Half-baked--astronomically high in cinematic calories but very low in nutritional value.
If a seven-year-old is really competent to make responsible life choices then Lucy's requests should just be honoured.
Yet another would-be comedy that mistakes cheap shock value for hilarity.
The film tells a very superficial story that winds up not resonating as much as it could. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Bare-budget drama of gay male couple whose ""accepted"" existence in a small Connecticut town gets overturned when the teacher half is accused of impropriety."
"Somehow overstuffed and boring, the film is at least notable for the sheer tonnage of CGI woodland creatures crammed onto the screen at once."
"You think they're dead, these zombie-film parodies, but, one after another, they keep lumbering back."
"Occasionally sharp but never quite as smartly formed as it could be, this Sex Drive is only partly worth the trip."
"A midnight movie for those fine with dozing off about twenty minutes in, once the charm of its single sentence log-line has worn off."
Entirely standard cop fare. And Don Johson is the cop.
"Within this haze of drug abuse, cockiness and hollowness, we're supposed to feel for our young, spoiled protagonist. Sadly, what we mostly feel is the pain of our eyes constantly rolling in our heads."
"A fitting title, it seems that almost everything in this film is either forsaken or just plain neglected, including plot, characters and logic."
"It's afraid to move too far one way or the other. For a movie about the man who wrote ""Let's Misbehave,"" there's an awful lot of behaving going on here."
"As a standalone film, the fatigued period drama goes in one era and out the other with little to add."
"Benoît Delhomme's cool cinematography and a truly lovely score, by Underworld's Karl Hydem, Rick Smith and Gabriel Yared, are the film's biggest assets."
Zzzzzzzz. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Ulph. Umph. Ach. ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzz.
"In general, the light is golden, the mood technologically sublime, the actuality of the experience a dead zero."
"To the Bone never quite succeeds ... The direction is too pedestrian, the script too generic and the film as a whole is more concerned with reassurance than with confrontation."
Fatally cautious.
Agony. A penance to sit through. When was the last time thirty people lectured you in a dream?
"It's alive! In a technical sense: images flicker on the screen, etc. But it is a soulless, unholy monstrosity. Behold: the movie without a protagonist!"
"The energy in the beginning creates wonder and awe, but wanes tremendously. Attempting to bring that energy back at the very end is just too late."
"Clearly wants to be seen as a metaphor for discovering what's truly important in life. But the adventure story is only intermittently successful. And while the filmmakers come tantalizingly close, the Big Theme eludes their grasp."
I've often wondered how Burroughs' scathing ruminations would translate to the big screen and now I know: not that well.
[L]ike a rejected pilot for a Nickelodeon sitcom... downright distasteful...
Has the shelf life of a dented milk carton.
I was very underwhelmed with his journey.
"A young Jack Nicholson might have pulled this off, but Jason Bateman is not Jack Nicholson. Pity the actor who thinks he's edgier than he actually is."
"Bizarrely, this Dutch film tries desperately to wedge true events into the shape of an American thriller, but the action sequences are so lacklustre..."
A bit of a mixed bag. Has several good jump scares and a few hard-to-ignore flaws.
"'El resultado es bastante mediocre, pues la cinta es bastante predecible y francamente aburrida'"
"This misbegotten psychological portrait eagerly foregrounds Leto's excess blubber and histrionic blather, delivered like bad improv outside the Dakota building."
"All the actors strive mightily not to get mired in the jackhammer moralizing, but it's mostly a losing cause."
"Jodie Foster's disappointing directorial debut, Little Man Tate, is a pseudo-problem picture scripted by Scott Frank with the same grasp of reality he demonstrated in Dead Again. "
"There's enough here to keep the Friday night crowds happy, but judged against the other installments in The Conjuring Universe, The Curse of La Llorona is a familiar exercise in haunted house tropes."
Doesn't even have the decency to be horrifyingly funny.
"Hittman wraps her pointed agenda in a deceptively lovely tone poem about adolescence and summer, almost impressionistic in its evocation of the raging hormones of the teenage years."
"""Ron"" ... at some point, it went wrong."
"As directed by Antoine Fuqua, the film is well-acted, occasionally hair-raising but ultimately made from stale material."
"With a running time of more than two hours, this sprawling, would-be epic needed to deliver far more."
"Working from a script that he rewrote, Chandor struggles to make the story's contradictions gel. They never do."
"'Alice Through the Looking Glass' isn't terrible and, in fairness, does feature an inspired moment or two, but the reality is it doesn't get much more unnecessary than this."
The film is not even interesting as a work of art.
"This might sound harsh, but God's Pocket is a movie that has no business existing."
The endearing qualities of Scooby-Doo and Mystery Inc. are overwhelmed by ambitions too big to be solved.
The real criminals are the screenwriters ...
"The cast cannot elevate a bland, lifeless narrative with direction from Daniel Espinosa that fails to capture any of the romantic yearning and melancholy associated with vampires or the excitement of the superhero genre the world has grown to love."
[Director] Bekmambetov is a reckless and juvenile storyteller with a regrettable knack for empty spectacle.
"It's like being force-fed, all in one sitting, an entire box of cheap... heart-shaped chocolates from the dollar store.... But ohmagosh, Bradley Cooper and Julia Roberts are so totally adorable together!"
"If you still want to see it, I won't talk you out of it. But that's as far as I'll go."
"Director John Whitesell is reduced to zeroing in on Kennedy's butt cleavage, a sure sign of comedic desperation."
"The Purge: Election Year is an OK sequel for die-hard fans of the series, but it won't win any new converts."
"Take heart: you may feel that it takes forever, but the movie will eventually end."
"Never is Albert confronted with the ramifications of her falsely hijacking a fatal disease, a sexual identity or a social strata that was alien to her."
"If you really want to know her story, you might have to read the book."
"Evidently, the film's raison d'etre proves to be its spectacular undoing. McCarthy's script is awful: bogged down with leaden dialogue that prolongs scenes for no reason."
"Not quite a film so much as a cinematic experiment, Snatched gamely asks the question: ""Is Amy Schumer funny enough... to transform a leaden Tinseltown turkey into pure comedy gold?"" The answer, alas, is firmly in the negative."
"Schlesinger, a filmmaker of broad strokes, can't bring off the difficult transition from bantering comedy to tear-jerking melodrama."
Director Damien O'Donnell and screenwriter Jeffrey Caine faithfully adhere to the bylaws of melodrama and quickly plunge us from triumph to tragedy.
"Potter's script pares down to virtual nothing the very narrative threads that allowed us, in the full-length version, to identify with his prickly protagonist."
"Its trailer promised cynical exploitation; the movie itself almost, kind of, sort of works as a character study, sometimes, if you're feeling generous."
An excitable but mawkish misfire by action-oriented filmmaker Frankenheimer. A vehicle designed to capitalize on Johnson's roguish appeal simply results in a dead bang.
Disappointing romantic comedy that starts well but then takes a nosedive into cliché and sickly sweet sentimentality.
"Nobody expects this to be, say, The French Connection, but it should make a little more sense."
"Stallone and Schwarzenegger are a couple of likeable old galoots, but they don't have much chemistry here."
"You can tell where this is all going, and the familiarity wouldn't be so bad if this cast could have some fun with the cliches. Alas, these CW stars pout and frown and yell, while lumbering and plodding through the Stephen King/Rob Reiner playbook."
"This may be this first time since ""Lucky Lady"" that I walked away from a film thinking that it needed more Liza."
Pretentious and ridiculous.
...mostly involves sermonizing of the stultifying kind.
Screenwriters Alex Gregory and Pete Huyck have devised a merely sophomoric reason to get these actors to take their clothes off to have sex.
...so thinly contrived and poorly executed that one would imagine this was the director's first film.
"Unless you're an M Night Shyamalan fanatic aching to see the writer/director play one of the film's main characters, there's no reason to endure Lady in the Water."
"Self-indulgent dreck. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Nudity, etc. - also Available)"
"The only reason to see this movie is to watch the 3-D and the special effects but, good as they are, they are certainly not worth 127 minutes trapped in a theater with Channing Tatum and this story."
"Too often, Cat's Meow feels stagey, dressy, miscast and generally inauthentic."
"It has all the right moves. It knows all the right words. Its characters have all the right clothes, expressions, fears, lusts and ambitions. But there's no payoff and it doesn't lead anywhere."
"Unlike A Room With a View or Howards End, it doesn't bring a book to life so much as distill it into visual Cliff's Notes."
The Matrix trilogy is so named for a reason: The most compelling aspect of the movies is that way-cool space. Revolutions spends too little time there.
"It looks like thinking hurts [Austin's] head, and watching him hurts mine."
"A star is born. Well, almost."
"On the Line could have had a future as a gay camp favorite if only it had tried a bit harder. But On the Line isn't even so bad it's funny, like Glitter. It's just bad."
"As an example of how not to make a movie, Repo Men deserves to be studied by film students."
"A single mother, a mysterious haunting, urban terror: This well-crafted Japanese horror remake has a too-familiar ""Ring"" to it."
Very boring and earthbound entertainment for the children.
The lighter moments are not enough to save a film that again feels like the most cynical of studio prospects.
This is all likely to go over like gangbusters at the box office ... but the overall sloppiness and genial contempt for the viewer is tough to ignore.
"As the story shifts from fanaticism to skepticism, Bar-Lev loses sight of his original line of inquiry on the nature of modern art when he doesn't need to."
"About one in three jokes hit their desired target, which is about par for the course for these kind of flicks."
Critical miscasting in the lead roles does more to damage Dracula Untold than sunlight and silver combined.
Frilly and sweet to a mind-numbing fault.
"Too often steps out of its era to adopt a knowing, politically correct, late-20th-century attitude to the society portrayed."
"Apparently, this is the first of a new trilogy. One can only hope it improves."
"For all of its ostensible thoughtfulness, in trying to describe ""real art,"" Random Acts of Violence ultimately doesn't describe anything at all."
"Good actors (including Liam Neeson and Laura Linney) are wasted in Eyre's new film, which is neither effective as anatomy of a troubled marriage nor satisfying as a Hitchcockian thriller about a missing wife."
"For a superhero origin film, it's pretty good, but it's hardly amazing."
"There are several times in the movie in which Neeson uses his wits instead of bullets to extricate himself from a difficult situation. In this kind of picture, that's called a plot twist."
"If you badly want to understand Appalachians, maybe just talk to a few instead?"
"It's not its anti-union take on the relevant issue, but the shallow treatment, cardboard characters, and overacting that bog down its well-intentioned message."
The movie fails to pull off all its trick moves.
"Mystery is the sorely needed trait for this appealing chance to start something fresh, young, and easy."
"How jarring to see a film so devoid of conflict, tension or struggle."
"This movie is Tarantino on speed, and without focus and style. It is in-your-face and proud of it with no apologies."
"The best of Underworld: Blood Wars is in the action sequences and not in its story, which has no greater substance. [Full review in Spanish]"
I don't care and can't even begin to pretend to care.
You'd think a movie about transplanting human consciousness would be smarter than this.
[Vanilla Sky] results...[in] a bittersweet outside with a soft and caramel center.
"Towne has a love of slow motion that's employed as if he's afraid you might miss one, rippling muscle. Worse than that, when people aren't exercising, they are often talking about exercising."
"The 20 minutes of smart humor here is nearly lost amid the bad puns and juvenile sex humor, including a finale that takes the phrase ""food porn"" to ridiculously literal extremes."
"At a relatively brief 99 minutes, Zombieland: Double Tap doesn't provide one with anywhere near enough time to figure out exactly why Zombieland: Double Tap exists."
"Historians now agree that Barnum wasn't the one who said ""There's a sucker born every minute,"" but it's hard to escape the feeling that you're being sold a poptimist bill of goods here."
Has all the suspense and intrigue of a less-than-groovy episode of Scooby-Doo.
"At once bloated and rushed, Eternals suffers from frequent lurches in tempo that dispel its occasional moments of tranquil thoughtfulness."
If you've seen the trailer for this adaptation of Cecelia Ahern's second novel then you probably needn't bother forking out for a ticket as they more or less signpost just how the story pans out.
"The set-up promises a lean slice of genre filmmaking. Unfortunately, the plot is overstretched and overwrought, with director Steven C Miller taking time out from the action to hit us in the face with symbolism and irony."
"More aphoristic than explorative, Solitary Man takes for granted the audience's interest in mapping a star's reckoning with his persona onto a sensational but shallow script."
A well-acted and perfectly intentioned Southern drama about a gay man coming out in 1973 that never keeps you guessing.
"Writer/director Kimberly Peirce has clearly done her homework. What she hasn't done, at least not here, is develop any strong point of view about the war."
The film colors its stale outline in ways both hackneyed and mundane.
It's a blah little exploitation picture that thinks it's a deep humanist parable.
"If you thought the era of woefully misconceived attempts at aping Pulp Fiction was mercifully over, then best duck and cover."
"Almost reflexively, the filmmakers skirt Dan's messier conflicts. But it is the moments when they don't dance around the awkward issue of a brother falling for his brother's girl that Dan is the most poignant."
"As tongue-in-cheek as the title sounds, it accurately captures the fawning tone of this jokey self-portrait, the sense that Cage is in fact starring in a love letter to himself."
"After his persuasively disturbing screenplay for Larry Clark's Kids, Harmony Korine 's Gummo comes as a disappointment."
Most of the jokes can be spotted a mile away.
"""Mile 22"" is a miss."
You began to wonder just how many times Shaun would think of an idea only to have a crook come up with another idea. Like playing tic-tac-toe.
It sure doesn't work today.
What are the chances you would leave a movie starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe shrugging your shoulders?
"Crass, chaotic comedy."
"There's a lot to like about the basic setup, but it's too often hindered by the film's many flaws and surprising conventionality."
...there's a reason it's been sitting on the shelf for over a year.
"The point of these movies should be to observe reality, not to shape reality into the equivalent of a cute animated movie."
Insert your own car-related gag here for the uninspired Fast & Furious.
A clunky drama that takes a potentially shocking story and renders it virtually inert.
The film plays like it's been methodically configured to snuff out an even marginal indulgence of its characters' emotions.
Leaves the viewer underwhelmed and unsatisfied.
"The Last Exorcism is completely boring, devoid of any scares, tension or unease and has one of the worst endings ever. Avoid at all costs."
"The dance sequences have a certain energy and aggressiveness but the plot is predictable, the performances are bland and the dialogue makes your toes curl."
"""Undefeated"" Palin did a fine job of making her fans feel like losers with this abortive trial balloon/infomercial. Losers and suckers."
A flop of a horror film that overestimates gore for actual scares.
What a mess. What in the world is this stupid miasma supposed to be?
That every supporting character is depicted as insufferable or pitiable or both would be bad enough; what's worse is that the couple discover nothing about themselves that wasn't obvious from the opening.
This limp psychodrama proves woefully short on character development or narrative structure.
"No matter how adorable you think Muniz is, it's becoming increasingly hard to buy him as a socially inept teenager/spy."
The majority of the movie's gags are staged so blandly that you're more likely to wince than laugh.
"The plot is laughably predictable, with a setup that is needlessly complicated followed by a denouement that is painfully obvious."
A tense comedy that progresses progressively towards emptiness. [Full review in Spanish]
"Daniels once again mistakes permissiveness for artistry, creating a picture that looks like it was shot on a reel of dirty underwear, developed in a mixture of spit, semen, and alcohol."
"As movies go, it's wholly predictable, occasionally and intentionally dull, and apparently quite lazy."
"While on its own lowbrow terms the movie may work well enough, 'Kick-Ass' outpoints this 'Smart-Ass' cousin by a wide margin."
"Between bouts of violence, it's a dull journey"
Most Johnny Cash fans probably don't care that much about how their hero ended up with June Carter. Therein resides the main problem with Walk the Line's devotion to simple truth over cherished fable.
It's doubly disappointing because before everyone turns into clichés this seemed poised to actually say something moderately interesting about love and relationships.
"A painfully bad film ... This ridiculous art-house nonsense is supposed to be a comedy, but I never laughed nor did I ever even come close to smiling."
"This shameless cultural jumble might make some kind of crazy sense for anyone who still thinks Presley the figurehead of pop vulgarity. That position has many successors, and Luhrmann is one of them."
"As much as one would like to feel for these characters, the limited story and almost clinically detached direction keep you oddly distanced."
"One of those rare movies that is so fantastically, fabulously bad, so bursting full of putrid dialogue and appalling scenes, that it becomes worth seeing as some sort of artifact of horribleness."
"Almost never pushes the boundaries far enough, seemingly patting itself on the back for peppering the f-word into a cartoon with such frequency."
everything that is wrong with One for the Money is the result of Katherine Heigl
Fans of the ancient craft of filmmaking will want to look the other way.
"Were it not already taken, Angels with Dirty Faces might have been an apt alternative title for this TRUE STORY."
"An overproduced, video-director remake, slick and grue-marinated and loud as a sonic boom."
The dynamics of Havana Nights haven't the urgency of the first Dirty Dancing.
"Saoirse Ronan brings a preternatural maturity to this starring role, but, most importantly, a sense of urgency, which is largely missing from much of the big-name cast."
"Neither karaoke with Come Sail Away... nor the appearance of Seth Rogen, keep [Like Father] from sinking. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Hasbro's track record in the cinematical arts is not great, but they should be applauded for their tireless efforts to find work for supermodels. They deserve to be movie stars too, guys."
"Romeo and Juliet do a lot more smooching than talking, which is possibly for the best. The film's one hope is that their chemistry might pull us through, but even here there's a calamity."
"While the sequel isn't bad, it lives up to its name as Second Best."
[The] polite inquiry [of the title] pretty well sums up the tone of this featherweight ensemble comedy about French people falling in and out of love.
"Manipulative and self-defeating, Crash resembles race-baiting PT Anderson fare or if Altman got stuck in the mid-80's."
"The cast is speckled with lively souls like Steve Zahn and Griffin Dunne, but the only person who wakes the movie from its slumbers is Emily Blunt."
"Uma ode ao vigilantismo, deixando de estabelecer, no processo, a diferença que fazia o original tão eficiente: o fato de que, na fantasia, os atos de violência não trazem consequências reais."
The effects crews do better work than the writers do.
Doom porn for dummies.
"With The Revenant, González Iñárritu gives us a film that is balanced between the intentions of Winding Refn and Scorsese but remains undecided. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Several decent movies are screaming to get out of ""Uptown Girls."""
There's a problem when you make a film so dark that Hotel Rwanda looks like a crowd-pleaser -- especially when the story asks filmgoers to leave their reasoning skills at home.
"Inept plotting, a lack of pacing, and a criminal neglect of its primary antagonist are a few of the nails that seal the lid on director Craig Gillespie's wayward remake of Tom Holland's original 1985 ""Fright Night."""
But when Last Dance works&#44; it does so spectacularly&#44; if inconsistently&#46; It&#8217;s easily the lesser of the three films&#44; but I find it difficult not to care immensely about what Tatum is up to&#44; especially when it involves dancing&#46; Take that for what it&#8217;s worth&#46;
"If it's not dazzling its audience with over-the-top madness, the film looks as wormed-over as the decomposing lump of man at its centre."
It's a shame the actors have to spoil cinematographer Robert Richardson's artistry by reciting the drivel that passes for dialog.
"Nuance doesn't matter to [Zhang], and his closeups encourage the nostril-flaring and eye-rolling of a silly soap opera."
"...either an over-extended or under developed treatment of a good idea. There's not enough there there to make ""Moon"" an exceptional genre piece."
A middling biopic that jams on the brakes about every 10 minutes.
"Outside of the Easy Money series, Kinnaman has rarely been allowed to utilize his tightly wound intensity this explicitly."
"""The Marrying Man"" seems to have died en route from Neil Simon's brain to the movie theater, but exactly where and why is anybody's guess. An autopsy by a professional is in order."
Extraordinary heroism deserves a less ordinary movie.
"If the animation and visual effects are state of the art, the dialogue predates the industrial age."
Holidays is not worth celebrating.
If you like The Matrix Resurrections more power to you. I hated practically every minute of it.
"No amount of strong acting, however, can entirely compensate for the dramatic conveniences or every shrill appearance by Jane's cartoonishly despicable roommates."
"The movie is well acted and mostly absorbing, but it spells out everything so painstakingly that there's zero room for subtext."
Looking terrified and screaming is really all that's required in David Self's inane script.
"The action, unmoored by any concrete sense of the station's architecture, grows increasingly incoherent."
There's nothing clever about the script.
"It's clear that this beautifully made film wants to root its horror in the less-is-more approach. But in this case, less is often just less."
"The soundtrack - an infectious blend of retro gospel, R&B and funk - often feels too breezy and soulful for this mundane affair, especially when it precedes scenes with pouty teenagers, even if they're world-weary sorts."
"Consequently, I can recommend it to 'enhanced interrogation' practitioners who are tired of waterboarding."
Does little more than toy with the passions of two Georgia families torn apart by violence.
Fizzles as a comedy and as an exploration of the stresses of work.
Parlez vous rip-off? No action adventure is spared a repeat performance in this CG-saturated nightmare.
Brainless chase flick doesn't even offer guilty pleasures.
"The more literal-minded medium of movies doesn't quite mesh 21st-century trappings with 15th-century references and titles. But effective actors can render these surface inconsistencies invisible, and there's the rub: They don't quite do it here."
"[S]till nothing will prepare you for the tone-deaf nature of this live-action abomination that inserts our cartoon protagonists, Who Framed Roger Rabbit-style, into a crass Manhattan misadventure about a celebrity wedding gone awry."
"The Hangover Part II isn't a dud, exactly -- some of it is very funny, and there are a few memorable jolts and outlandish dirty moments. But it feels, at times, like a routine adventure film set overseas."
"Scenes of solemn importance drag on to the point of self-parody in an attempt at establishing mood, while dialogue reeks of connect-the-dots spoonfeeding."
The problem of the movie comes from the predominantly masculine vision that it offers: It is not in vain that the responsible for the film are two men - Director and Screenwriter. [Full review in Spanish]
"The result is a well-meaning but somewhat granola, partly engaging yet disorganized documentary, one that searches for an imprecise story and struggles to keep its chief ambitions afloat."
This is a movie that mines its plot from the Stone Age (or is it Stoned Age?) of caper comedies.
"For all of the great performances, Abraham chooses to focus on the fussin' and fightin' between Hank and Audrey like a walking talking country song instead of the grit and determination that got Williams to the Grand Ole Opry."
Bull Durham for dummies.
a disjointed adventure movie that has no place to go
"Although significantly flawed, the final result for Fever Pitch is pleasant."
The picture isn't good enough to earn my full-throated defense. A half-hearted defense will have to do.
"Sadly, Pitch Black was directed by the man who made the best science fiction movie of 1996, The Arrival."
The movie underserves both its central couple and its larger ideas about the future of civilization&#46;
Too many logic holes and an uneven center doom what could have been a highlight of the recent vampire craze.
"The last time Murphy played a nightclub owner, we got Harlem Nights, which was actually better."
If violence is truly the only way to resurrect matrimonial bliss then perhaps we should seriously consider a constitutional amendment banning heterosexual marriage.
It all comes apart as Varathan abruptly relegates [the heroine] to the background ... and is overtaken by patriarchal and cinematic clichés.
"Playful adaptation from Steven Soderbergh features Matt Damon, 30 pounds heavier, whose beautifully nuanced take on wide-eyed naiveté saves this otherwise pointless goof."
A surprisingly timid and largely toothless action fantasy for kids.
The story goes by the numbers.
"Just Like Heaven is a typical romantic comedy that stumbles on the problems of being not particularly funny or interesting. It could have been truly heartwarming, but is so heavy handed here that the final result is merely sentimental pap."
"The actors gamely keep up their spirits, but the male characters are too one-dimensional and the female characters too bizarrely divorced from reality to be at all engaging."
Keanu Reeves as a lawyer? Simply hilarious.
George Stevens's meticulously observed 1951 version of Theodore Dreiser's massive 1925 novel An American Tragedy ...
"...if nothing else, the entire flick may be worth a look for the absurd moment in which Leatherface breaks loose with a particularly apt example of the ol' shifty eye."
Promising horror pic that can't deliver the goods.
"The King of Staten Island is a long journey to spend with someone you want to like and should like, but never do."
"The plot twists come in the final 30 minutes, and while they are entertaining, they're also ludicrous. One begins to wish the movie had stuck with its original plan of just being a mediocre cop thriller, rather than changing into something quasi-clever."
"The romance is contrived; the sexual jokes rarely land; and the cameos seem more for show than for storytelling. That's not to say that I didn't laugh, or enjoy it, but it's horribly predictable, and about as frequently tasteless as it is charming"
"There's more yakking than screwing, and the result is flaccid and formulaic enough to remind you how mundane porn flicks are when physical stimulation gets taken out of the equation."
No amount of pretty scenery can conceal the tedium.
"There's no arguing that there's a clever concept that anchors the ""Now You See Me"" franchise - expect more sequels - but razzle-dazzle and the art of misdirection can take you only so far."
"There are several interesting political themes hidden beneath the surface of this Russian horror film, but they only serve as the basis for a generic story that fails to get off the ground. [Full review in Spanish]"
Berlin Alexanderplatz feels like a Saturday afternoon matinee compared to this.
The hustle has always seemed more exciting than the payoff for James Toback. When Will I Be Loved is no exception to this filmmaker's own idiosyncratic rules of conduct.
An oversimplified look at mental illness that never takes flight.
"The Front Runner is a disappointing effort from Jason Reitman. It's all style and little substance, a Gary Hart masquerade."
"It appears that when Luc Besson wants to kill one of his promising franchises, he calls in Olivier Megaton to do the dirty work."
The filmmakers here were seemingly so sure on which side of the line Hamer and Gault stood that they missed any opportunity to make the audience wonder.
It doesn't help that much of City by the Sea plays so precisely lock step in the same order as so many other policiers. It's difficult to muster up much excitement as the film lurches to its pre-ordained conclusion.
"A man's man would certainly emit quite a few low, heartfelt growls were he forced to sit through the entirety of Confessions Of A Shopaholic, a shrill, garish knock-off of Sex And The City."
Banal and trite where it could have been insightful and emotionally truthful.
"The only reason a person hops back-and-forth in one scene, from scene to scene, using (a) color film, (b) black-and-white stock, and (c) digital video (then back to (b), then (c) again, then (a), then...) is merely to do it because they can."
Honest Thief is a generic actioner with little entertainment value. Liam Neeson's formidable stage presence is absent from this performance.
The characters and situations are so exagerated to the point it gets irritating or even ridiculous. [Full review in Spanish]
"A case study of a film that opens well enough, promises much, changes horses in midstream, and sinks."
"Simultaneously frantic and dull, Noodle Shop has no hint of the restraint or meticulous concern with form exhibited in Zhang's earlier blockbusters."
"""Flash Gordon"" probably looked cool at the storyboard stage, too. If ""Jodo"" was such a genius, why didn't he make some other masterpiece instead?"
"A rather unsettling mix of light and dark, which robs it of power and causes it to become muddled."
"It ends up demystifying Dean, perhaps by accident but no less regrettably."
"Truth is, there's also too much &#8232; Michael Cera. Which isn't the star's fault. I blame the movie's bad timing, and its delayed release."
"Neither Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gyllenhaal nor a creepy-crawly monster can save this Alien ripoff. There's no life in Life, just leftovers."
"[I]t's a compelling way to tell a story, but in keeping us at a certain distance from its characters, the movie never connects on an emotional level."
"The movie is really just one scene after other, giving the impression that each tableau could form the basis of a separate narrative, but the images just do not gel as segments of a 128-minute work."
"There are a few amusing shticks, but School for Scoundrels fails to make the grade."
Absolutely no saving graces here.
"Lurches inelegantly between doe-eyed sentiment to child-friendly spookiness to comic slapstick, and all three modes are done poorly."
occasionally seems like an MTV/Varsity Blues pop variation of In the Valley of Elah
"The sucker punch is to our retinas, eardrums, and tiny, tender brain cells."
"It feels like writer, co-director and star Dax Shepard has unleashed some kind of freakish Franken-film on movie-goers."
"If nothing else, Black Christmas will always be remembered as the inferior older brother to Clark's other Christmas flick, the Tito of the Jackson clan."
"Sugar, not petrol, is the fuel that comes to mind watching candy-hued, visually hyperactive, narratively sputtering Speed Racer."
"Waititi's simplistic view of human behavior and political history isn't even as sophisticated as Indiana Jones's witty cultural summation: ""Nazis -- I hate those guys!"""
"Action scenes...are excitingly choreographed and feature some impressive stunts. Unfortunately, this is supposed to be a comedy and the laughs are few and far between"
"""Interstellar,"" a spectacular, redundant puzzle, a hundred and sixty-seven minutes long, makes you feel virtuous for having sat through it rather than happy that you saw it."
"This is a documentary about two different things, connected by a single thread. The only thing connecting these two stories is a doctor, Pietro Bartolo. He treats both the residents of Lampedusa, and he treats the refugees as well."
"Perhaps had they been given a script, a purpose or a mission, Miami Vice the movie might have been something worthy of the talented Mann's attention."
Bay is increasingly looking more like a dinosaur – a veteran filmmaker whose style and material doesn’t mesh with today’s Hollywood.
"If you want to experience nostalgia, rent Pillow Talk--it does a much better job."
"Horrible Bosses 2 is by no means an atrocity, but it's tired and unexceptional, which is perhaps worse."
"You're meant to feel Jimmy's pain, to share his rage, but that's hard when he doesn't even seem human."
The cumulative effect of the Soldiers & Peacemakers' straight-forward and blunt narration of linear history is a film only slightly less dry than matzoh.
"While the moviemaking in Miami Vice is impeccable as always, its story finally turns out to be too flimsy a reed to support all of the weight put on it."
"What's a romantic comedy to do when it is neither romantic nor comedic? When that film is Admission, it plunges forward drunkenly, hoping to overcome its inadequacies with goodwill created by the cast."
The film's spectacle outweighs the character or story elements that truly evoke audiences' attentions in the lasting or memorable ways that did the incipient franchises which no doubt inspired it. . .
"Perhaps if I had read the book, Zeroville the film would have made more sense."
Blonde ignores the assertive and hardworking real-life Marilyn Monroe and instead gives us a lurid tale of perpetual victimization.
"In Premonition, Sandra Bullock plays a woman going through a horrifying experience. She keeps waking up in this movie."
"Without the foundation of a strong script, there is nothing that could be done to fix Broken City."
"An updated remake that offers a few family laughs, but nothing more. Full review in Spanish"
In this joyless context the professionalism feels like slow suffocation.
"The cinematographer may have gotten some great material for his reel... for the rest of us, it is a two plus hour long waste of time."
"Bride Wars is also a missed opportunity for a crackerjack comedy, dropping any hint of mean-spirited delight to kitten play with mundane nuptial wish-fulfillment and half-realized romantic nonsense."
"the movie keeps enough of Richard's messy past off screen to feel like a hagiography with a few concessions, rather than a true warts-and-all portrait."
Almost nothing in the movie seems original.
It occasionally feels more like a brand experience than an actual movie.
"Look for more than robustly-executed hokum here, and you look in vain."
Nothing more than an excuse for violent ninja fighting with a huge body count and plenty of blood - real and CGI.
"Paranoia, spinal injuries, psychic distress, impromptu amputations, self-mutilation -- it's all in there, convincingly rendered (the first-rate sound design exacerbates every fracture) and finally pointless."
It Might Get Loud doesn't really offer enough comparative analysis to lead to a fully educated guess about why such passionate players are so awkward and reserved with each other when given a chance to measure their skills against the best.
"It's clearly struggling to be what it presumes its audience wants -- bawdy, violent, yet socially aware. But it fails because it lacks any real spark."
"Universal survived the Depression thanks to Boris Karloff and Deanna Durbin, the latter horror being a reedy-voiced child star who infected a number of late 30s musicals before creeping puberty ended her career. This is one of her more tolerable vehicles."
"The worst part is undoubtedly the script, which clunks and groans all the way under the weight of it's own exposition - tragically and unforgivably, it fails to tell a good story."
Howard tries desperately to balance the comedy against the screenplay's tense domestic melodrama ... and mostly fails.
Neither Johansson nor Portman convince.
"Strained, lighter-than-air romantic comedy about a corporate executive who falls for the smalltown, snowbound locals she's sent to layoff. Like its heroine, it never warms up."
"The film directed by Sam Raimi, a man who usually works from a clear roadmap into fantastical realms, is a mess."
"These actors, alas, are at the service of a submoronic script and special effects that look like a video game writ large."
The first hour or so of International is pretty tedious.
A Street Cat Named Bob has its heart in the right place but doesn't quite land on a tone to unite hard hitting drama and a cat-based comedy.
"If you're 16 or under, you might get a real charge out of Swimfan. Anyone over that age is likely to experience a crushing case of deja vu."
"Whatever Muse drives Malick, whose best work feels both found - in the sense of discovered in the shoot and edit - and profound, he could be accused of cheating on her in Knight of Cups, leapfrogging between unsatisfactory short-term conquests."
"Director Marc Forster takes a melodramatic plot from a Sunday-night cable feature and tries to expand it to the big screen with bigger stars and more exotic locales, but it still retains the predictability of a movie of the week."
It's hard to watch Supernova without recalling that wonderful Israeli definition of a camel - a horse that's been assembled by a committee.
"While some of its aesthetic and narrative components are vivid, Marrowbone as a whole feels simultaneously overstuffed and derivative."
O que houve com Rene Zellweger?
"By now we've seen too many authentic, dynamic Chinese action movies, especially Zhang Yimou's recent Shadow and The Great Wall, to accept this dross."
"The movie seems to consist of a lot of loose strands that go nowhere or end up being discarded. Fortunately, Juliet, Naked still gets the point across that emotionally stunted men should grow up and appreciate what they have."
"The inclusion of unnecessary background songs (not subtitled) and a romantic subplot result in a sluggishly paced story, which is further undermined by a lengthy flashback and a preposterous final reveal."
"The film is more exciting that watching paint dry, however, because of great work by some very talented actors."
There are four reasons to see this movie and writer-director Nancy Meyers isn't one.
It's incredible how little actually happens considering all the possibilities.
"More simple-minded than the grade-school primers Penn's character obsessively reads, more manipulative than Fox News' wartime coverage, offers more product placement than Cast Away, and feels twice as long as Reds."
Peppermint is woefully suspect in its flimsy feminine fireworks beyond the stereotypical gimmickry of a scorned housewife eradicating the bothersome brown menace.
"[Ghostbusters: Afterlife is] not boring necessarily, but it's also not particularly intriguing given the available possibilities its very existence suggests."
"A confusing rehash of Batman, Indiana Jones and James Bond movies."
"This Jennifer Lopez vehicle is a fender bender from which she emerges with some scrapes and bruises, but we didn't need to witness her receiving them"
"All of this unfolds with such predictability, the title might as well be The Great Foregone Conclusion."
"All surface and no soul. Come to think of it, the surface isn't so darned hot either."
"The whole story, such as it is, seems to exist on the level of metaphor, but even metaphors need some definition and weight to keep us interested."
The best things in the movie aren't transporting or diverting but merely incite intellectual recognition: Yes. OK. That's amusing.
This is one of the most confounding films I've ever seen.
"For the sake of perspective, xXx 3 makes Suicide Squad look like Casablanca."
Often entertaining&#44; but there&#8217;s no breathing room to process anything beyond hitting the highs and lows&#46; We&#8217;re left in some limbo between celebrating what makes a high-end restaurant sing and considering this culinary legend&#8217;s life a cautionary tale&#46;
The filmmakers are so intent on bludgeoning their audience into submission that after 10 minutes you've become numb.
"Undeniably rousing, but deeply irresponsible, Argo fans the flames surrounding historical events likely to still remain raw in the memory of many viewers."
"Aerial scenes, family drama and aircraft carrier sequences all are well done... [But] viewers should leave the theater feeling inspired by Jesse Brown's valiant deeds. But due to the script's blunders, they may not."
"One of Tales' strongest points is made accidentally: Its huge cast of interviewees consists of one Asian speaker, one Latino, three African-Americans, and five women - one of whom pulls double-duty as a woman of color."
"What goes wrong? Lack of humour, for starters. Dry and drab, Trank's film sacrifices the primary-colour aesthetics of the comics for a gritty 'real-world' environment."
"In direction and camerawork the picture stands out, but the story isn't one that is going to give anyone a great thrill."
"This is the end of the Highlander series, they say. Not an eon too soon."
The Irish horror movie You Are Not My Mother introduces a compelling premise that it promptly proceeds to squander.
"It's lazy, barrel-scraping cinema at its worst."
"Poor Brendan Fraser, he must have known he had nothing to work with here, he looks as if he's sleepwalking through the role, not a career highlight for him."
"Finding Amanda, the alternate title of which might well have been ""I Oughta Be in Rehab,"" is an uneasy chronicle of addiction and denial wrapped in the rhythms of Neil Simon."
"Try as I might, I just wasn't all that invested in the fate of Alex and Sean or their own private close encounter with the third kind. Which is a shame as the filmmaker shows a keen flair for an interesting visual and aural palette."
"""Life Itself"" is one of the worst kind of bad movies, because it achieves nothing that it sets out to do."
Waterworld's Kevin Reynolds is simply the wrong director to attempt yet another adaptation of Alexandre Dumas's classic tale ... his rendition is lifeless and flat.
A dismal mess.
"""The Son of No One"" is terrible, which is really a shame, because it's clearly so heartfelt and sincere."
An average thriller that's not nearly as smart as it thinks it is.
"A toothless commentary on suburban jealousy, with familial strain mixed in at random."
So deep was the concern that Jolie fully realize the role of Lara Croft: Tomb Raider that the story got lost in the jungle.
Nauseating amount of glucose sentiment.
An uneven and fairly forgettable comedy that produces only sporadic laughter.
Pushes the least interesting relationships to the front and shoves the most interesting ones too the back.
"Where the first two Despicable Me's had a heart, Minions has only an adrenal gland."
Inconsequential and predictable.
It's the kind of movie you forget just as you're clicking on to whatever the Netflix Overlords think you should be watching next.
"The bottom line for me is that Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen simply wasn't as much fun as the original. In their zeal to give us more of what they think we want, Bay and crew have sucked all the joy out of their own franchise."
"... the film appears to have had its own exorcism, with critical ideas and images suggested which are never followed through on."
"Why should we care whether Sly or Mel wins? There's no good guy. There's no bad guy. There's just Mel and Sly, and they just disagree."
A movie with one awkward identity crisis.
"If only this movie could have stopped at ""Eat."""
"... as limitless technology teaches the wizard about his own human limitations, Franco hits grace notes that let us see glimmers of how great and powerful this uneven Oz might have been."
An absolutely interminable misfire...
I's not hard to understand how Hughes turns out so many screenplays. He probably just leaves the old ones in his computer so they're easier to rewrite.
"This safe, solemn tale of an aged artist whose vitality is briefly revived by a pretty young thing is unconvincing as an articulation of the potentially spiritual nature of the artist/model relationship."
You want to know how the Janes of the world happen. Is it money? Power? Ideology? You never find out.
Has about as much swagger as its bland and basic title.
"A laidback and carefree piece of cinema with the lowest of stakes, 'Palm Beach' falls under the weight of its own decadence and affluence."
"To think Gran Torino is a masterpiece, you have to accept the contrived setups and sledgehammer melodrama."
"Storytelling and philosophy don't measure up, leaving only audio and visuals to entertain"
"A promising, intermittently entrancing film that the viewer wishes could have made more of an impact than it does."
The only problem for me was that the plot failed to grab the attention the way the visuals did: a very involved storyline about terrorists and a biological weapon went on at least a half-hour too long.
The Bubble is a radically unfunny comedy that doesn't land any of its jokes.
"Unlike the way things work in a typical casino, in this case, The House loses."
"Jason Bourne packs a punch, but it's softened by dizzying camera work and an expected story that loses what made the franchise so thrilling from the start."
"The narrative is criminal, building little mystery or intrigue. [Full Review in Spanish]"
It starts to take on a distinctly ghoulish quality&#44; especially a scene that imagines her frame of mind before her death&#46; It&#8217;s a film that ultimately feels less like a celebration and more like further exploitation of the star&#46;
Is Texas Chainsaw Massacre good? No! Is Texas Chainsaw Massacre entertaining? Yes!
The movie is so nervous about offending anyone that it's hardly any fun.
"Spends so much time trying to impress us with its roaming camera and wispy, digitalized specters that it forgets to be even a teensy bit scary."
"A film which proves the theory that if magicians were also bankrobbers, they'd still be pretty stupid."
"That it never quite reaches an 'Aha!' moment is the movie's chief flaw, as we have been set up to expect answers."
I'm willing to embrace boring British period pieces as much as the next critic. But there are limits.
"It's almost as if someone involved let the cat out of the bag figuring that angry critics are certainly better for your career than angry, pissed-off fans. (Hugh, I'm looking at you.)"
"The film's pro-family subplot is the only curve ball thrown in this sordid, soggy tale."
"There's nothing visually arresting here, with much of the film looking like it was borrowed from District 9, Thor 3, Rollerball, Transformers, Blade Runner, AI and Terminator. That wouldn't have been such a big deal had the central story not been so lame."
Michael Caine makes not a single interpretive misstep in the British thriller Harry Brown. The tragedy is that the performance comes to nothing. Nearly everything else in the film is vile.
The script never even comes close to resolving any of the issues it raises.
"Rather than make a statement, Schlesinger cops out in every way."
A half-baked gory intro to a Saturday morning cartoon show that we don't even get to see.
"We can respect it for being as well-made as it is, for knowing when to take advantage of serendipity in the environment, and for its level of gore. It just doesn’t work well dramatically."
"When ""Words on Bathroom Walls"" is at its sunniest and most blithe, the moral of the story feels a little more like a punchline than is appropriate."
"Four people marry, divorce, hop into one another's beds, talk dirty, and make each other miserable... Why did anyone think this would make for an entertaining movie?"
Winds through their relationship for nearly two hours&#44; only to end up with shortcuts and compromises that seem dissatisfying for both the couple and the audience&#46;
A childhood reminiscence set in 1953 that seems to recycle elements from every coming-of-age movie ever made.
Fails to either humanize Billy the Kid or justify his lore.
"Entertaining but problematic, WTF almost hits the target but is scuppered by friendly fire."
"Without Wahlberg's rock-solid presence as a former Marine sniper turned hunted man, the mediocrity of Shooter would be clearer sooner."
This isn&#8217;t &#8220;M&#42;A&#42;S&#42;H&#44;&#8221; not even close&#46; It is also a war depiction that we have seen multiple times&#44; and with a much better story&#44; although I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen such a dunderheaded protagonist&#46;
"Happy's tantrums, which the movie pretends are liberating explosions of self-expression, aren't nearly maniacal enough to reach comic delirium."
"An overworked horror-thriller based on an absolutely ridiculous concept that, at various points in the movie, comes tantalizingly close to working."
Cheers and tears will follow&#46;
"Sex ironically has little to do with the story, which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never, ever, leave a large dog alone with a toddler. But never mind all that; the boobs are fantasti"
"It's a lot easier to pack laughs into a half-hour television show than a full-length feature film, and if you need proof, you'll find 84 minutes of it in Reno 911!: Miami."
It's a feature-length whine of frustrated entitlement. A movie less suited to its cultural moment would be hard to imagine.
"The Front Runner remains something of an enigma. In the quest to retain the humanity of the characters on all sides of the conflict, Reitman ends up with a film that's not just dramatically inert, but is unclear about what it wants to say."
"Without ever acknowledging his own sadism, Haneke self-righteously lays his aesthetic and moral cards on the table."
Less a movie than a Technicolor op-ed on the housing crisis.
Gentle kook and visual frolicking bury emotion in this tale of a man mired in grief. Little of its head-scratching whimsy makes a melancholy landing; most just floats away on wisps of insignificance.
Who do you want to play it opposite Julia&#63; Well&#44; what if you could get a guy associated with Julia and widely considered the most charming man in the last decades of movies&#63; Clooney&#46;&#10;&#10;So why is it so clear that this movie is miscast&#63;
"The screenplay by Frank A. Cappello and Kevin Brodbin is only interesting for a few characters, hardly the story."
Austen herself would probably find the movie tacky and contrived.
"""Labor Day"" seems designed for the crowd that devours Nicholas Sparks's romantic daydreams."
"Garland is trying to make a serious, intelligent, complex science fiction movie, but his characters end up being puppets that fall into the traps that the filmmaker creates. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Far North is a disorganized, undisciplined, rambling, pointless exercise in undigested material, and you can't blame the actors, the technicians or the middle men. This movie fails at the level of writing and direction."
"The film is a seemingly endless series of convoluted double-dealing, backstabbing, and factional realignment."
"Malick has moved from self-discovery to self-affirmation; he knows exactly what he's looking for, and Knight of Cups, for all its splendor, made me wish that he could take a swig and forget."
"Yesterday proves that you need much more than a high concept to make a successful movie. The music of The Beatles is legendary and will be celebrated for the foreseeable future, but this film is not the showcase that it could have been."
Violent and uneven.
It's actually the audience that needs rescuing.
The crucial thing missing is what should be the essence of a courtroom drama: our immersion in how Lipstadt's lawyers stake out their strategy.
"One of the problems, I think, is that given that the books were aimed at young women, I think the filmmakers have been terrified at making anything too violent."
Mamet's somewhat original script almost succeeds in breathing new life into the genre ... before making a fatal miscalculation in plotting toward the end.
"Good-natured and amiable though it is, it's not particularly funny, nor are its sunny elements enough to justify dragging yourself out of the house to see it."
I couldn't help but think that a documentary on the making of The Birthday Cake would be an exponentially better film experience than watching the film itself.
"An increasingly preposterous and pretentious horror thriller that's low on scares, intelligence and suspense."
"Although short stories usually make terrific source material for films, in this case the adaptation suggests that this is not one of those instances"
The film is too blinded by manufactured sentimentality to see the more compelling what-if scenario lying right in front of its eyes.
"Os personagens so terrivelmente caricaturais - e no estou me referindo ao visual, e sim s suas personalidades."
"the sight of a sky full of planes swerving, swooping, and engaging in graceful, ferocious battle is thrilling. It's not enough to save RED TAILS from being a glorious failure, but it saves it from being a total loss"
Gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it's not clear whether we're supposed to shriek or laugh.
"As more and more films use this conceit, the premise of someone filming at all salient moments becomes more and more strained, until the device itself becomes not just derivative, but positively cumbersome."
The cheap use of the hot-button issue of pedophilia coupled with negatively minded ignorance regarding homosexuality is not only offensive but-far worse-completely uninvolving
"Comedy hits the road, but the jokes fall flat."
"While it feels churlish to complain about a genre piece that's been executed with such precise craft, I have to confess that, in both versions, I've found Dragon Tattoo's plot profoundly boring."
"Lacking any meat on its bones, ['Madagascar'] is a cartoon about nothing. Not that there's anything wrong with that."
"Don't get attached to anybody, or anything. Poor actors. They took off to make a movie in Africa and all they got was a stinking, fake-blood-soaked t-shirt."
"The leads are good and good together. But despite a long run time, other issues are not developed in what is very much a remake and not a reworking."

Women without Men is a series of tableaux to which no one brought the vivants.
"The minidramas on display, in the hospital or in the anguish of Zapruder's accidental chronicling of a horror, dart this way and that, inconclusively."
Most damaging to the film is perhaps its futile insistence that it's somehow more than a bargain-basement B picture.
"Hollywood, it seems, has lost the knack of how to make a good romantic comedy."
a remake that recalls the most pestering and innervating facets that the word 'remake' summons in even optimists such as myself
It's clear right from the get-go that Luhrmann isn't looking to deviate from the flashiness that would come to define his career...
"Obnoxious and painfully dull, ""Serenity"" is an early candidate for worst film of 2019"
Lecter is fascinating because he's an enigma; his deadly allure more appealing because his past is a mystery.
"[Zeffirelli] had a real chance to delve into the creative process of a genius here, but has only managed to come up with the kind of bottom-feeding, lowbrow tabloid fodder that any opera-phobic hack might produce."
... ought to be more affecting than it is.
"We've heard this song before -- catchy but banal, monotonous -- and it hasn't gotten any better with time."
"While the discussion it has kicked up is worthwhile and Omalu deserves all the credit he can get, a Google search on his life and struggles may prove more entertaining."
"Much of the movie is just plain vicious. At best, it's sad and grotesque, rather than hilarious."
The film is far too flighty to allow its actors to bring much depth or pathos to their characters.
"Its simply full of boring unpleasantness. A strange blip in the Marvel filmography. This is a multiverse of Madness? More like lazy, mediocre, and clumsy misguidedness."
This sexaholic Lost Weekend is way too punitive -- the celebrity version of Looking For Mr. Goodbar.
"This is a case of taking things too far without the proper structure in place, leaving it trapped like its hapless protagonists far from safety."
A weird combo cougar shaming sci-fi horror spree buffet&#44; don&apos;t ask&#44; the film takes freaky fountain of youth generation gap cinema to the next level that seems to get lost somewhere along the way - whether as a confusion of plot points or genres&#46;
"""Scoob!"" has a bit of a chaotic story, and its attempt to include a lot of plot in a mere 90 minutes quickly turns its lively energy from infectious to exhausting."
Strictly for fans on school vacation.
&#91;The Gray Man&#93; is the most generic piece of mail order crud imaginable given &#91;the directors&apos;&#93; pedigree&#46;
"Watson's integration into the creepily inclusive company does suck you into the story, but her journey to becoming its poster girl and eventual whistle-blower is less convincing."
"While the movie is occasionally enjoyable cheese and Tom Cruise quite riveting, ""Rock of Ages"" is a musical with a hollow center...it could be ""Showgirls"" for a new generation."
"While there's something deeply fascinating about the psychology of those in this tale, Cedar gives us one of the more frustrating characters to try to understand in quite some time."
There are only so many jabs you can take at B-movie genre tropes before you run out of gags.
This is a profoundly ahistoric movie -- a definitive Hollywood muddle.
"Were Ava just a generic action thriller it'd be difficult to recommend thanks to its litany of clichés, tortuously dull plot, and stale action which sometimes reaches a ""Liam Neeson climbing a fence in Taken 3"" level of editing by Zach Staenberg."
"Gladiator isn't bad enough to be really good... It's not blatantly ridiculous in the manner of those awful Italian-made efforts cable TV carries in the wee hours, but neither has it the dramatic weight to be taken seriously. "
"Sometimes, I hate Hollywood."
"It's about as direct in its play to the anti-Trump crowd as it can possibly be. Nevertheless, I can't help but wonder who actually has the stomach for Rudnick's Trump-enraged quarantine view into the left-leaning electorate psyche."
"Patrick Lussier's film is an incompetent, nihilistic exercise in gore and pseudophilosophy."
"The result is not only a messy and awkward montage of trendy 'new media' lazily substituting for cinematography, it stretches credulity to tell this whole story, this intimately, in this same way, from so many angles."
"There are many other fine moments of cinematic poetry, if only Marshall could be more consistent with them."
"A feature directorial debut for Alberto Belli, Gatlopp feels a bit too much like an audition for bigger/better projects—as far as a modest budget allows, it throws every cinematic trick in the book at us, to high-energy if sometimes grating effect."
This isn't worth turning off the PlayStation to go see.
"Not a riff on slasher, nor an homage, but a straight up repetition, complete with all the banalities therein."
Pretty but pointless
2 Fast 2 Furious is that rare film that's perfectly described by one of its co-stars' names: Ludacris.
A ramshackle and laboriously whimsical comedic trifle that falls back on Woody Allen's increasingly tired penchant for nattering faux-realism.
"Mr. Lespert and his screenwriters tend to telegraph what's happening next with on-the-nose dialogue, leaving behind an orderly but not vividly realized biography (or necessarily a complete one)."
This script is so fundamentally flawed I can't imagine anyone wanting to produce it.
This rendering is chillier than yesterday's coffee.

"Visually stunning and imaginative, this otherwise generic cop drama totally drops the ball when it comes to its most interesting and unique aspects of free will vs. pre-determination."
Thunderbirds revolves around a boring family of heroic do-gooders.
Gosling is both amazing and adrift in this almost thoroughly forgettable upscale legal drama and you're left praying that the stardom so surely coming his way doesn't come with a Hopkins clause attached.
"The twists are thoroughly predictable, but even if any tension and suspense were generated, it would all be squandered by the film's contrived fizzle of an anticlimax, which is not only disappointing but makes little sense."
"Harris' debut feature has a hipness and a feel for the language of the streets that isn't faked, and it's great to see a young black woman's point of view for once. But the direction is sloppy, much of the acting amateurish, and the film falls to pieces. "
Ryan Reynolds finds himself stuck in another choppy and convoluted sci-fi adventure.
The necessity and significance of beginning the franchise anew falters even further.
"A startling about-face for Australian director Alex Proyas, and an unwelcome one as well."
"The feature flatlines quickly, desperate to do anything that might trigger a reaction out of the audience. Considered, thoughtful screenwriting has no place here."
"The leads have moments of charm, but a movie deserves stars who sizzle."
"The script sends one mixed message after another. What are we to feel about a woman who uses a parent-faculty meeting to place a public personals ad for herself as her child cringes, or who, well -- how else do you put this? -- seems pretty, um, easy."
"Writer/director Daniel Ragussis tries to work a weird mixture of ridiculousness and outrage. He doesn't really succeed, but you have to admire the effort."
"With hardly any rhythm or grace, without creativity and commerciality, Ozzy is just a dead end. [Full review in Spanish]"

Tucker's patchy road movie takes the dysfunctional family to the outer limits of the Twilight Zone.
"A lurid, overheated Southern Gothic that wallows in its own unpleasantness."
"Unfortunately, the characters feel more like symbols than people, despite strong performances, including what might be Portman's finest work to date."
"Not having seen Final Destination (1 or 2), I am perhaps not in the best position to judge Final Destination 3. On the other hand, I know a stinker when I see one."
...ultimately done in by the need to abide by Hollywood convention and send everyone home in a joshing good mood.
[It's] little more than a dismissive diversion -- with product placement to spare.
"To make matters worse, the chemistry between Faris and Derbez is non-existent and makes you yearn, in a way you never thought possible, for the glory days of Hawn and Russell."
"If the movie just doesn't have the nostalgic pull of a Chinatown or the camp appeal of an L.A. Confidential, it may be that its material didn't really justify the full-feature treatment."
"4:30pm 1 March 2012, the time a I saw the film industry and possibly humankind, hit a brand new low with Project X. A film so bad it doesn't deserve to be called a film or be allowed a release anywhere inside our solar system - including Pluto."
Too many senten-tious insights and lame jokes have been grafted on to the basic yarn.
"Win a Date With Tad Hamilton! starts out as fresh as your popcorn, but turns stale before you finish it."
The imaginative leaps in the animation are dragged down by the deadweight storytelling.
The stars play the same tired characters they have made a grand living off for too many years.

A wearyingly overlong series of battles and explosions with the thinnest of connective tissue and an ADD-like disregard for follow-through.
So boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it.
The filmmaker's methodology backfires by undercutting the credibility of the testimony presented and overshadowing any actual miscarriage of justice.
"The biggest problem with Click is not that it isn't funny, but that the moments worthy of laughs often feel isolated from the sloppily assembled plot."
"Your Place or Mine is... fine. It does not ruin a great American rock band's catalog. But doesn't make the viewer feel much of anything, which is antithetical to the rom-com."
There's some irony in an amazing story lost in a film about an amazing city lost in the jungle.
"Brittany Murphy is a very complex woman. Her eyes say ""take me,"" her roots say ""color me,"" and her random facial spasms say ""treat me for Parkinson's."""
"Blacklight is another flimsy action clunker thatll come and go without so much as a whimper.

Reduces policies that caused the deaths of thousands to the equivalent of a first-person-shooter video game.
"An often dull, clunky and contrived political thriller."

"While Wolverine contains several nice fight scenes and a couple of enjoyable action sequences, one can't help but feel that it thoroughly wastes Jackman."
...a sporadically amusing yet thoroughly tedious misfire of nigh disastrous proportions.
Dark Blue proclaims itself a character drama and a voyage of self-discovery for the flawed cop -- which proves to be its fatal weakness.
"It's just terrible, with long stretches in which the sea of writers don't even try to insert any humour, followed by an attempted joke that doesn't work on any level."
"Marconi's indifference to detail extends to any consideration of what, exactly, Lagerfeld does for a living, not to mention the history of his rise in the fashion world."
When your lead actor can't outact Ahnuld you know your movie is in trouble.
"The much-hyped film adaptation, in which James was closely involved, sticks closely to the novel, but is both strengthened and weakened by what director Sam Taylor-Johnson and screenwriter Kelly Marcel decided to omit."
"Unlike 'Gettysburg,' however, 'Gods and Generals' is slow-moving and stilted and is punctuated by speeches rather than drama and action."
"As a thriller, it's a dead loss, mainly due to a dearth of suspects - this film must have had the lowest extras budget of last year."
It is a missed opportunity rather than an aimless failure.
There isn't a single idea in Glass that Shyamalan didn't express with more flair almost two decades ago.
"It Comes at Night had the potential to grow into something special. Instead, we are left underwhelmed as we await its inevitable arrival. One which, sadly, never comes."
A frustrating film that asks more questions than answers.
The lack of flavor to elevate it from simple movie-of-the-week theatrics to the actual impact of cinematic convictions lessens this story focus and keeps us distracted as we look for the Lifetime logo to appear in the bottom corner.
Reviewing a Tyler Perry movie is a bit like reviewing the weather report.
"It's a condescending, exploitative piece of awards bait that desperately tries to disguise its lack of insight through mocking self-awareness."
"When the narratives are formally compared as an expression of karma and reincarnation, the juxtaposition is vacuous."
The opportunity is here to give Rebel Wilson a vehicle to tap into something more emotionally viable along with funny&#46; Instead it relies on obvious jokes to fit her comic personality and fails to fully engage with the setup&#46;
Is it too overblown to suggest that what passes for the modern American mainstream comedy has finally descended into the downright sociopathic?
"Julian Donkey-Boy, a movie so edgy that you'd like to push it off the edge of a cliff."
"Nothing in Gigli is sustained, from pace to plot points to character functions. It appears to have been chopped up and put back together again more than once."
Youth Without Youth will translate to cinemas without audiences.
"Does not enhance reputations or entrance audiences despite, or because of, pretentions to being larger than pure adventure."
This Mother Teresa biopic offers Hallmark Channel-grade inspiration of the most sluggish sort.
"Every single frame reeks of misplaced enthusiasm, and of an imagination run riot. MSG is the kind of film that has the potential of instantly turning a movie hall into a torture chamber."
Ferrell can't jump in the tepid Semi-Pro
Embarrassing.
"Nice look, but there's more promise than delivered goods."
"The result: all the shallowness of a superhero movie, but none of the fun."
The trailer tells the whole story and the movie telegraphs its punches.
"The film is heavy with political subtext, but the plot is lukewarm comedy."
The film goes so far out of its way to avoid seeming lurid or melodramatic it ends up being almost emotionally incomprehensible in its obliqueness.
"Because the runners' standings in the race are never really established, and are largely beside the point, the film keeps cutting back to these increasingly sentimentalized accounts of hardship overcome."
The Book Of Henry turns out to be odder than odd and heading somewhere that is borderline ridiculous.
The threads running through Extract are less actual ideas than loose screws rattling around aimlessly.
This is a children&#8217;s film through and through&#44; with lots of pretty colors and butt jokes to entertain the 4-to-8-year-old range&#46;
"A lean, low-budget and claustrophobic mistaken-identity thriller that's so stripped-down, it's nearly nonexistent."
"The film, in the end, is blandly efficient. It plods along, entirely free from intrigue or tension, only steps away, at all times, from its own inertia."
Clooney is too talented a filmmaker not to get in his licks. But this alternately comic and deadly earnest satire of the dark underbelly of 1950s suburbia -the Coen brothers had a hand in the script-is a movie that feels tonally at war with itself.
An incompetent mishmash of mawkish sentimentality larded with a few pleasant musical numbers and some random asides about Israel.
Can't resist even the most obvious cliches. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Maybe noir just feels a bit old at this point. No matter what, the movie isn't worth the Texas heat."
There's not a lot that can save Lockout from being what it is: 94 minutes of mindless fun.
"Too long, and larded with exposition, this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community."
"Like Perry's acting, the movie swings from manic comedy to quiet drama in a heartbeat."
A fright-free disaster that makes you long for the 80's glory days of straight-to-video horror.
"Clumsy and cliched, which keeps it from hitting any kind of stride."
"""How Do You Know,"" his latest, is a near miss. A film that is completely in love with the sound of its human voices, this is a rather slim romantic comedy featuring a love triangle involving hugely appealing Reese Witherspoon in an odd role."
"Let's just say that enjoyment, even trashy enjoyment, is not to be sneered at. Boredom, on the other hand, is -- and that's the real crime committed by the dead-in-the-water Fool's Gold."
The movie doesn't do justice to a promising premise.
Heavy sigh. So many potential puns. So little space.
"A very long time coming, The Curse of La Llorona, ultimately fails to entertain much less scare."
"Just about the only way to make sense of the film is to view its Christian family the way that the director, James Marsh, does -- with a contempt masquerading as social criticism."
"Jennifer's Body is a tragic desecration of mammoth talent that'll serve as an arresting step back in the buoyant career of Oscar-winning Juno scribe Diablo Cody. Plus it needed a sexpot who could act, too, and Megan Fox can't."
A more accurate title might have been Audience Vs. Cliche.
"If ever there was a movie designed to convince the audience into thinking it's wasting its time, The Village is it."
"Blatantly silly and a bit bland, ""Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star"" is better than its low-rent trailer might have suggested, but not by enough to warrant a full recommendation."
"Somehow securing cinematic distribution when its script, plot and execution scream straight-to-DVD, Armoured is the worst kind of B-movie: a dull one."
"X-Men: Apocalypse is not a bad movie, but it confirms that the saga needs new blood in it. [Full review in Spanish]"
Deverakonda is a genuine star and certainly could have hoped for a better film than Liger to be his Bollywood debut. Even his infinite charm and dedication aren’t enough to uplift it.
"Aside from a few effective, low-key scenes, the movie doesn't involve the viewer."
"The good intentions it carries out to the plains don't make up for the tentative falseness at its center, a hero who could herself benefit from a portraitist's clear vision."
What in God's name were they thinking???
"A decent cast has been assembled here but, with the sole exception of Monaghan, none of them are able to make much of the cliches that they have been dealt."
The film's most abiding mystery lies in the question of why it ever got made.
"An aggressive extreme seductress who is on the brink of nearly raping the gullible Ghost, when cornering him in his tub with an offer of towels to dry his tush, doesn't do the trick in this possibly covert bio."
"Sure, global warming is scary, but chances are even Al Gore would be baffled by Larry Fessenden's moody, Arctic-set 'eco-thriller.'"
"Hall certainly seems to grasp the mindset of the modern warrior, sensitively showing the way that steely exteriors can conceal deep rivers of pain and regret."
"It's a pedestrian, flat drama that screams out 'amateur' in almost every frame."
The movie's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase 'fatal script error.'
"The mystery posed by ""Oblivion"" as a whole is why its mysteries are posed so clumsily, and worked out so murkily."
"Overplotted and the film ends up as a head-scratcher -- we're supposed to sympathize with Parnassus, but the case just isn't strongly made."
"This cloddishly contrived suspenser is too busy to bore, but too farfetched to thrill."
There have been quite a few decent adaptations of 'Oliver Twist.' This isn't one of them.
"Cube is genuinely charming, but even he can't elevate the proceedings above the coarse sensibilities of Brian Levant, whose niche is directing boorish, noisy children's pictures."
...wince-inducing in the extreme...
[Rushmore is] overblown with despicable and unfunny plot twists which create the illusion that audience members are seeing something worthwhile.
"In the end, it really does seem these people were worth a movie, but that the movie is giving us only part of the story."
"A Wrinkle in Time is a sappy melodrama, devoid of mystery or wonder. Director Ava DuVernay beats positivity in with a sledgehammer."
"PETA may have a field day with this one, but few others will."
Poignant without being too goopy.
There is probably much more and much less to the life and times of Stevie Nicks than what is presented in this picture. But it will take someone else to bring that story to the screen.
"While Gone has some visual style, the cheap and melodramatic script fails to make it to the party."
"If you positively drenched Kurt Vonnegut's novel Slaughterhouse Five in goo, you might get something like The Time Traveler's Wife."
A wan Wan offering&#46;
"Once it all clicks into place and viewers are left to engage with the characters, the heavy misery and self-importance of the piece becomes overwhelming."
Costner swings and misses
Portman reminds one less of Falconetti and more of a Paris Hilton-esque socialite who accidentally wandered into Supercuts.
"Leaden with cliches, obvious red herrings and logic-abandoning choices by the lead characters, the Russell Gewirtz script is the proverbial pig in De Niro-Pacino lipstick."
"This is the announcement of a visually talented artist (Talbot), a visionary DP (Newport-Berra), and two incredible actors (Fails and Majors), but a very clunky script."
It's because the premise is so intriguing and the drama is so compelling that the result is so confounding.
"With its low-stakes chase scenes, obvious-from-the-get-go villains and nonsensical plotting, this feels more like a 96-minute-long episode of Scooby-Doo that's been laboriously translated into another language and then back into English."
"Every scene is coated with Marshall's thumbprints, ultimately connecting into a manhandled, mangled, misshapen whole, its themes written out in thunderously obvious cues."
"A more appropriate title would have been Screwed, in reference to the character's predicament, and the audience's response to wasting money on this clunker."
"Unfortunately the story, which sees Sarah Paulson playing a hospital psychiatrist who specialises in treating 'those individuals who believe they are superheroes', isn't a great one."
"Lawrence is a joy, but the movie, sadly, isn't."
"...from such a usually nuanced and thought-provoking auteur, it's hard not to see the film as a minor entry. The Bastards feels like what happens when an undeniably great filmmaker stoops to sensationalism"
"""The Song of Sway Lake"" is hardly what you'd call a satisfying movie."
"An ill-conceived series of vignettes in which no clich remains unexplored, phony pathos drowns the ending and the characters are black Southern stereotypes."
"Curious and long, the few worthy moments are owned by [Sarah Michelle] Gellar."
"The film is slick, but unsatisfying."
The greatest weakness of Green Book is that it insists on trying to find the humour in nearly every situation Shirly and Vallelonga encounter.
Nothing’s worse than a laborious comedy seeking a laugh you’re not feeling.
Eagle Eye churns and flails and piles on pointless and improbable complications.
A bland disappointment that bleaches nearly every colorful thing about the character.
Even the most dimwitted of kids will see through this poorly made mishmash of every other holiday film.
"...silly, repetitive, episodic, mannered..."
"[A] desecration of a comedy classic -- not a remake of the Blake Edwards films, it's more like fictional-character assassination..."
It's certainly not the worst Bond film in the world but it definitely misses the mark of being one of the best.
"There are some dedicated performances, but this unfocused drama adds nothing new to the girls' boarding school film curriculum."
"A title card says this King Arthur, grimly directed by Antoine Fuqua, is based on the latest research into the mythic past. Maybe so. But one can't help thinking the research that really counted was that into the more recent box-office charts."
"The supporting cast is mind-melting: Michael Madsen is as out of place in this Medieval milieu as Meat Loaf in a hoop skirt, and Meat Loaf is just out of place."
"Like going out with old school buddies: at first, you're thrilled to be with old friends again, but before too long, you realize that there just isn't anything new."
"[Director] McKay has made another wildly uneven, PG-13-that-could-be-R comedy that veers from explosively funny, overlong improvs (a Southern-fried dinner prayer to 'Dear Baby Jesus') to black holes from which no laugh can escape."
"The characterizations are paper thin, the constant letter-reading narration is dry, and the sex scenes are anti-erotic to the point of parody."
The characters are so underdeveloped that there exists no real relationship between them on screen or in fact between characters and the audience.
"Forster's symbolism goes from clever to exasperating to, finally, sort of klutzily endearing - the work of a gifted art student who can't resist piling on the glitter."
"There are no more ingratiating characters in the popular culture than Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny, but even their monumental charisma is sorely tested in this charmless, vastly overhyped and greedily overmerchandised [film]."
"The film approaches McEnroe like a special animal to be studied. But ultimately, the effect is more akin to counting sheep."
More preoccupied with themes and moods than providing anything intriguing plot-wise or character-wise for the viewer to truly care about.
"The student suicide rate is a dab on the high side in the tepid teen thriller, ""Innocence."""
"Leaving no clich unturned, Coffee Date provides cheesy music, chats about gaydar and the obligatory are-you-looking-at-mine? urinal scene."
There is a distinct pet-shop whiff coming off this weirdly soulless and not especially funny or exciting family comedy from Disney about guinea pigs.
"For all its questions of morality, mortality and politics, the film feels empty at its core, not unlike the sleek modern spaces where the story’s ultra-wealthy, ultra-corrupt and ultra-clichéd scheme and cavort joylessly."
This was a great short film stretched out and padded to become a dull feature length flick.
"If you're not fans of the adventues of Steve and Terri, you should avoid this like the dreaded King Brown snake. Personally, I'd rather watch them on the Animal Planet."
"This Red Balloon is gorgeously photographed, and finely acted; like the first film, it gives its plaything a real, solid dimensionality. But despite its title, it never really soars."
"The movie is leaden and self-serious, with an unusually hollow performance from Norton, who's not for a moment convincing as a man of raging passion. Far better is Paul Giamatti."
I hate to say this -- partly because I don't want it to be true and partly because it's such a terrible pun -- but could the zombie movie finally be dead?
"Demolition plays like a failed iteration of a 1970s angry-misfit movie (think Jack Nicholson in Five Easy Pieces), not like the real thing."

Earth hath not anything to show more fatuous than this sequel to an already otiose movie of the hit television series.
The best choice that Burns makes in his film is to avoid any scenes with Tucci--but no one ever said that Burns didn't know how to make himself look good.
The primary mistake of Ben Is Back is the movie's inability to trust the inherent drama of its premise.
It's wack.
"Everything about MAC and Me -- not least the fact that it's fairly well-made and involving -- smacks of crass calculation. The filmmakers even have the gall, in the movie's parting shot, to announce a sequel."
"Rupture is a rather disappointing return for the idiosyncratic director, and would have benefitted greatly with some more tightly honed characterization and less aimless wandering through a retrofitted office building."
A genially toothless political satire.
"Plainly sick and grotesque, existing only to shock or nauseate an audience with hideous images, stale performances, lifeless photography, and painfully vile actions."
"It's a bad sign when a film which aims only for froth can't achieve more than moments of embarrassment, punctuated with sporadic agitation."
"Maybe Metal Lords is the proof of what the final season of GOT made us all suspect: Unless they have someone else's writing to adapt, then Weiss and Shapiro can't be trusted to come up with anything interesting by themselves."
"For all its stylistic flourishes, The Silent Twins winds up a relatively superficial entry in the genre of mental health biopics."
"Moretti here mostly meanders agreeably but toothlessly, parting the veils of ecclesiastical pomp and bureaucracy and finding nothing more subversive than a rejected thespian suffering from an extreme case of stage fright."
"Woody Allen said of true comedy: If it bends, it's funny. This movie snaps like a twig."
"In terms of recent Pacific Theatre flicks, it ain't much better than John Woo's instantly forgettable Windtalkers, which is more than a little ironic since both pictures share the same vapid lead (Adam Beach)."
"Belongs to the most rote category of interpretations, hinting at nothing darker than a fascination with sulking bad boys bored by wealth."
"At 2 hours and 15 minutes, Lucky You does play a bit long. It's probably about two hours longer than it needs to be."
"None of the pieces is terribly original in concept, the performances are mostly as shaky as the camerawork, and the connecting thread is stretched pretty thin."
"Duplex collapses in rubble long before the duplex of the film does, and it's not even interesting wreckage."
Matthew Goode and the capable supporting cast can't save this film from its bland mediocrity
Shouldn't act as if parents appeasing their messed-up child is as moving as people actually giving in to the power of belief.
"Time Is Illmatic is well-informed but inessential, a making-of featurette barely expanded to feature length at a trim 74 minutes."
Shorts is too lazy and telegraphed to be classed as a good children's film and not smart enough to keep grown-ups engaged for its duration.
Plot? What plot?
"A bona fide, bums-in-the-air fiasco that needs to be burned and the ashes hurtled off in the direction of the nearest black hole as soon as you can, NASA."
"Watching Charlie Bartlett only makes Wes Anderson's work seem more accomplished by comparison, because it underscores that thin line separating the agreeably fanciful from the overbearingly precious."
"A movie that more than once confuses the line between laid-back and lethargic, it wanders around slack-jawed and weirdly inert."
Unexceptional acting and an excess of cop-film cliches!
"[The] all-in absurdity the film could have used more of if it was going to take the sheer comic route, and too often it settles for routine sitcom-lite situations that feel like lazy play calls."
The cliches in the addiction storyline land with a real clunk because of the decision to call speed pills “dolls.” 
"A film with real distribution, directed by a woman as well as written by one is a rare enough occurrence that I wish I didn't have to point out all that's wrong with Kelly & Cal."
Unappealing characters and a dumb story. Skip it.
"Digital photography, with its limited ability to capture rapid movement, renders the close combat choppy and disorienting, and none of the kills is especially memorable."
"Sadly the Hangover is well and truly over. Sadly, because it could have been so much fun - like the first film"
"Three Oscar-winning actors walk into a movie and, well, nothing much happens."
"Carter has with The X-Files: I Want to Believe created a mediocre mystery that relies too frequently on coincidence and screenwriting convenience to elicit genuine interest, much less ""belief"" in its twists and turns."
It's ok but nothing special
This dramedy could have been much funnier&#44; but it falls back on wobbly writing and on overly-sincere&#44; one-note sermons about war and service&#46; 
It's for moviegoers who like their pizzas with extra cheese.
Director Radu Mihaileanu exploits this heavy-duty historical context to try and wrench some pathos out of his otherwise predictable triumph-over-adversity tale.
Speeded-up motion camera tics add to overall jerkiness - and a series of coincidences and unexplained comings and goings leave you thinking that Besson is impatient with actual story-telling. Fantasy thugs may relish this no-brainer actioner.
&#46;&#46;&#46;periodically watchable yet mostly underwhelming&#46;&#46;&#46;
"Nazis on the moon! What could be more brilliantly bonkers than the lunatic premise of satirical sci-fi action comedy Iron Sky? Sadly, Finnish director Timo Vuorensola fails to make the most of his conceit."
"Thank God for coffee, which provides the only caffeinated jolt to the otherwise deflated Kicking and Screaming."
Along with the messy script is some absolutely horrendous CGI.
"the weirdest thing about Fighting is how it seems to be fighting itself, as if there were a much longer movie left on the cutting room floor"
"Ultimately, it's not a very good flick. But it features a splendidly nasty performance by Ed Harris."
"Why should we care about Edie Sedgwick? Factory Girl, fatally, can't find a reason."
Should someone with four films under his belt really be regressing to the point where he is making a cheap horror flick that resembles nothing so much as a British Fifties B-movie?
"Baldwin took a similarly fanciful history-mining approach for Tribulation 99, but Mock Up on Mu is more than twice as long and determinedly more obscure."
"Some die-hard fans will no doubt like it, but most likely INLAND EMPIRE (yes - all capitals) will only be remembered as the second orthographically peculiar title after Mullholland Dr."
"Fly Me to the Moon is an awkward mix of proficient 3-D animation, detailed technical recreation and strained storytelling that stalls on takeoff."
"Brosnan and Moore look great together on the poster, but in the film the pairing isn't perfect."
As cold as the Hudson River in January.
Standard Statham stuff.
A disappointing and muddled return to the franchise that lacks the grit and urgency of the originals.
"While Crowe's acting is certainly more subtle than most of the brouhaha around him, he has little chance to display the affecting humanity that's one of his chief assets."
"We Are Your Friends is to electronic dance music DJs what Punchline is to standup comedians, a laughable repre-Zen-tation of what it's like to be them."
"At times, the film seems on the verge of rising above its frankly propagandistic intentions, but it never really confronts the Darwinian themes built into the material."
"Match Point may be Allen's best film in years, but the disastrous casting of Rhys-Myers makes it another disappointment."
"The waste of talent is criminal..the movie equivalent of shooting a man in Reno, just to watch him die..a long journey into night that will leave you dazed."
"The film ends up as a tale told by an ideologue, full of sound and fury, of question-begging certitudes and the siege engines of self-righteousness."
"With nowhere for any of the characters to go, literally, the story becomes a tendentious exercise in belaboring a point."
A sexed-up recruitment movie that strains to do for cops what Baywatch did for lifeguards.
Deliver us from screenplays that force likable protagonists to twist and bend their personalities to serve the contortions of a ridiculous and formulaic plot.
Savages reels you in but then doesn't finish the job.
Oh how the mighty have fallen&#33; Taika Waititi was clearly given significantly more freedom here and it is not a good result&#46; The slapstick comedy is way too frequent and makes the film feel like a spoof of it&apos;s own characters&#46; It&apos;s dumb fun&#46;&#46;&#46;but not much&#46;
"If you've seen the original film, there's no reason to watch this new one; aside from a few modern updates, it's the exact same movie."
"Adler lingers instead of delivers with the effort, which could use a great deal more anguish and a lot more movement."
Dugan ... encourages one and all to be as frat-house gross as possible.
I'm not sure any five pages of this script by director Nicholas Jarecki hold together.
"It's so riddled with complications and exposition (a queen's dowry, hurricanes, libraries in Spain) you wish the audience had just been handed an appendix and footnotes that covered the boring parts."
Just icky.
Both husband and wife seem to be in way over their heads.
"A product whose only clear goal is getting the two men in the room so we can giggle: at the president's awkwardness and grievance-airing, at the singer's polite bad manners, at the ways that the men connect, a little, by hating on the Beatles."
I used to think Lady in the Water was Shyamalan's worst movie. No more.
"It may be slightly better than 'Batman v Superman', but that's a low bar."
Flies whenever the Krays go Kray-Kray and plummets whenever they try to act normal.
"A film that fails to cause anguish like the first, and with a predictable and bland end. [Full review in Spanish]"
There are the occasional moments when Bushwick lets on that it knows that this is all truly awful.
"...a comic book film set in the west, with stock characters equally given to violence and wisecracks..."
"An extremely well-made, very grisly and ultimately dishonest slasher film that's too clever for its own good."
"P2 doesn't have the grisly intensity of Aja's other work, in spite of a few moments of cartoonish gore."
"While it's true that few viewers will venture into a theater showing this remake for the story, the screenplay should not be a detriment to enjoyment. Less talking and more dancing would have made for a more footloose and fancy-free environment."
"Williams can hit the notes; she's slight, thin-legged, a serious waif. We can worry about her easily enough. The problem is that nothing sticks out more than poised acting in a naturalistic film."
"When farce goes wrong it can REALLY go wrong and this one is like a wedding cake that just crumbles to the floor. The cast has talent, just not for this particular comedy ."
"Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler are so pleasant in The Ugly Truth that it's a shame to spoil their party. But toil and try as they do, the comedy bogs down in relentless predictability and the puzzling overuse of naughty words."
Too watered down for adults - lacking the satiric bite you might expect from a tale narrated by Death - and too grim and dull for kids.
"Morgan borrows Christmas-specific nastiness from a wide range of fright flicks, but the result is less than the sum of its parts."
Those who would like a storyline not caressed by cliché had better beware.
"Under the modern flummery, behind the faux amateurism and the handheld shudder, Cloverfield is a vastly old-fashioned piece of work, creaking with hilarious contrivance."
There are 23 letters in 'the twist ending is idiotic.' And in 'Joel Schumacher can bite me.' And in 'go to another movie tonight.'
The fundamental ineptness of Gunpowder Milkshake appears to be a consequence of the exponentially swelling glut of streaming options.
"With predominantly improvised dialogue and performances, Felt gains scant narrative complexity from an over-reliance on a no-frills documentary style."
"At times ""Something Borrowed"" is almost offensively unrealistic."
"A rather mechanical, soulless affair that avoids politics or anything else that might clearly define who these characters are and why we should care."
"The movie is bland hackwork; its crime isn't incompetence, but indifference."
It's hard to separate that sentiment from the fact that Right Now is still a carefully constructed performance.
...things went from mediocre to worse in this entry.
"It may be an easy swipe to take, but this Barbershop just doesn't make the cut."
"This was not a sequel that anybody needed, outside of the accountants. And there's another already planned."
"The film begins to stumble, then, once the focus shifts to a narrative that's almost distractingly convoluted..."
"Suffers even more than the Harry Potter films from a compulsion to be faithful to the source material, including cramming in a head-spinning assortment of characters and subplots."
"Alberti loses the edge to become more manipulative. The cinematography still shows the quality of a talented filmmaker, but his determination to be noncommittal takes that quality down a notch."
"Although it provides modest insight, this muddled and formulaic thriller tends to oversimplify the sociopolitical conflicts in its titular setting."
You have to give the man credit. Brooks is willing to try anything. A lengthy routine about a botched audience-participation improvisation is as conceptually stunning as any of Andy Kaufman's flights of weirdness. But narratively it stops the movie dead.
"Siskel turns many interviews into interrogations, browbeating his subject, demanding dramatic apologies, eager to expose a hypocrisy that Powell doesn't seem to have in him."
"We get a smattering of piercing thoughts about family separation as sanctioned by the U.S. government and a roster of deeply felt performances, but not the vision to see it through."
"More forgettable than loathsome, the kind of movie that occasionally rubs salt in your wounds by reminding you what could have been, but mostly just dissipates from memory as it's playing."
"A sequel, a costume fantasy, a romantic melodrama, a CGI war spectacular, a puzzling celebration of beauty over substance."
"The film is such candy-floss that it may not realise what a great screwball clinch it could have staged: the seer versus the shrink, two lovers fighting to get a lead on human behaviour."
An uneasy blend of whimsy with elements that are deliberately harsh or humdrum.
Parental Content Review
"Traveling to London, Paris & Marrakech, it goes nowhere..it's frantic, floundering pop culture sci-fi..."
Even a persuasive supporting cast gets Heaven only so far.
"Awful, but never memorably awful."
Same deal as the original.
"There's a limit to the film's effectiveness being set entirely in the glass corridors of the police station. Scenes that rely heavily on intricate sound design really pop, but the visuals (cumbersome close-ups, tepid two-shots) lack the energy to match."
Bang! Bang! Boring.
"What's most disappointing about the remake is how little it tries to define its own sense of silliness, content to reheat instead of creating a fresh direction of action icon confusion for a new generation."
"May run just 82 minutes (and that includes drawn-out final credits), but the picture's brevity can't hide what a toothless waste of potential it all is."
"It's just not funny. Not only is it not funny, it's unfunny."
"McGowan's film doesn't want to get its hands dirty, which winds up making its portrait of cruel twilight-years realities-and the enduring power of love to see one through those difficulties-as easily digestible as its lush rural panoramas are picturesque."
Adam Sandler's astonishing run of bottom-of-the-barrel comedies continues with Blended...
"Just as you're settling down, convinced the film knows what it's doing, it takes a complete wrong turn. It separates Law and Whitaker, who were on form and had great chemistry, and gives the film a romantic sub plot instead."
"The magic that existed behind those massive doors of the original park are completely gone, and ""Fallen Kingdom"" is a cheap clone."
"...the movie, which rarely leaves the couple's apartment, adopts a palpably repetitive feel that slowly-but-surely drains the viewer's interest..."
The fact that the scares are so low and the film is so uneven makes it a frustrating watch.
"Lacking psychological intelligence or, for that matter, awareness of Hollywood sociology, Mommie Dearest is just a collection of screechy scenes further distanced by convictionless direction."
"as The 5th Wave proves, mediocrity at the middle of any adventure leads to a distinct feeling of displeasure once the ""to be continued"" conceit rolls out"
This world of aliens and gadgets and history influenced by extraterrestrial involvement has no right to have remained this static for this long.
"The bloodshed is oftentimes so severe, it abruptly kills off the humor from conversations or confusions that segue into the violence."
"[Keanu Reeves] plays at Sophie's Choice... [And] as if he were in Minority Report, Keanu moves his hands and performs air mapping. [Full review in Spanish]"
It doesn't take much to guess how the plot will unfold. [Full review in Spanish]
One scavenger hunt that's definitely not worth playing...it has more climaxes than a porno movie.
Paul Schrader is a master storyteller&#44; but even masters are capable of misfires&#46;
"If you ever find yourself in outer space and the only person talking any sense is Ryan Reynolds, locate the nearest escape hatch."
"""Rambo: Last Blood"" has the earnestness of a eulogy, and it lands like the most inappropriately hilarious roast."
It&apos;s a series of catchphrases and stylish outfits that often feels like it&apos;s searching for a purpose&#46;
Misbegotten horror movie adaptation of the best-selling video games.
Hemsworth's emotionless performance (and a murky subplot about his wife's inexplicable descent into madness) mean that this scattershot Western misses its mark.
"Since Married Too? is not Perry's first attempt at filmmaking, his reliance on formula becomes disconcerting. In fact, since the execrable Meet the Browns, Perry's conventions have been unacceptable."
I suspect... that everybody involved will be relieved to see it in their rearview mirrors.
"Luke Wilson and Sarah Paulson are wonderful actors, but they are stuck playing broad caricatures more suited to a particularly crass old episode of Two and a Half Men than a film with such lofty ambitions."
The Hateful Eight seems like the poorest from all the Tarantino films. [Full Review in Spanish]
"After watching this depressing film, I felt as tired as Al Pacino's character looked."
"A serviceable if somewhat redundant horror sequel that dribbles out its secrets slowly, ""Sinister 2"" doesn't have a particularly satisfying end - it's somehow both too drawn-out and abrupt - but it's got creepiness galore."
"Hayley and Jeff come across in almost equally repellent measure, their behaviors driven less by organic impulses than by their need to satisfy the script's elaborate series of reversals and counter-reversals."
Five minutes of it? Fun. 90 minutes? Not so fun.
"It would have been better for ""The Wall"" to stay away from the allegorical and tell only a tale of physical action geared toward survival; then it might have been more effective and meaningful."
"Charles Stone III's film ultimately succeeds as a convincing social plea, but fails as compelling cinema."
"If you are determined to see Transformers: The Age of Extinction, here are some suggestions: Bring earplugs, medication for what may be your first experience with Restless Leg Syndrome, and a pre-1960s misogyny."
"Is it scarier than the original? No, despite souped-up visuals by commercial and music-video director Andrew Douglas, making his feature-film debut."
"I'd write that this is the worst production Crystal has been involved with this year, but we all saw the Oscars."
Any film that has twenty minutes in which the only humor stems from Hugh Grant's inability to say such Mafioso terms as 'fuggedaboutit'--that is a movie with problems.
"Mediocre performances and poorly-constructed musical numbers are the low points in this modestly interesting all-talking, all-singing production."
"[It] does more or less deliver on its promise of seeing a massive, prehistoric shark wreaking havoc ... This, though, is a case where 'more' is preferable to any amount of 'less.'"
"Scary Movie is destined to be remembered not for its laugh-per-minute ratio, but for breaking a barrier of crudeness in mainstream movies."
"If you're not going to break out of the box when you move mediums with a musical, it is critical to use the box very, very well. Unfortunately, ""The Last Five Years"" does neither."
"As talking-dog movies go, Marmaduke makes Beverly Hills Chihuahua look like Up."
"If people wonder why so many racists automatically think African American men are violent thugs, a movie like All Day and a Night just fuels that racism, because this unoriginal and uninspired movie panders to the worst negative stereotypes."
"Sexist in a way that it (wrongly) thinks is cheeky-sexy-fun and devoid of any meaningful diversity, the film is seemingly set both in the 28th century and a time before women and people of color could own property."
These improvisational comedy scenes often resulted in that sick second-hand embarrassment feeling you get when you watch someone you want to like succumb to stage fright.
"It's step-dad vs. bio-dad in this saggy, draggy comedy, too raunchy for kids and not funny enough for grown-ups."
"You know you're watching a bare-bones, witless screenplay when the writers can't merge the Dickensian parable with the morals of modern-day casual sex by making a good old-fashioned Yet-To-Come joke about the final ghost."
"When it's over, you may feel like cutting off your own hand for having paid good money at the ticket counter."
"A routine, rah-rah sports movie."
"Credited writers Gregg Chabot, Kevin Peterka and Matt Greenberg took their dialogue from every action movie you've seen, and characterizations don't amount to a hill of dragon dung."
A disappointment because it failed to peak my interest like Baz Luhrman's Romeo & Juliet did.
"Director David Cronenberg is almost always compelling. Many of his movies have potent, startling shock. But A Dangerous Method doesn't shock; it nags."
Did you ever notice that the best romantic comedies are often the cynical ones?
"Elaborate, sporadically amusing but awfully lightweight followup."
"For some reason, Disney keeps making really, really crappy live-action films."
Anakin's a real mannequin in this stiffly-executed CG feature.
"While there's a bit of hero worship going on that deflates the piece, and Wain's direction is surprisingly uninspired, the biggest problem is the script that tries to cover too much ground."
The acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the Wal-Mart checkout line.
Gore seekers need only to know the body count is high and the scares are cheap as director Peter Hyams shares his beast's repellent disregard for human life.
A cooped-up slog.
The beginning of Crossover looks like a mash-up of McG's Fastlane and Wayne Brady's storied appearance on Chappelle's Show.
Sandler should know better.
"[The Guillotines] offers a little of everything - action, drama, propaganda, romance - but spread frustratingly thin under a thick glossy sheen."
"It takes a light touch to do pastry well, and Paris 36 was made with a heavy hand."
"Kaufman, whatever you think of him, deserves better."
"""Southpaw"" descends into a tedious exercise of formulaic filmmaking that leaves you feeling worse for Gyllenhaal and Whitaker than the characters they play on screen."
"Christopher Plummer works hard to give us his idea of John Barrymore in this record of a theatrical tour-de-force, which is more dramatically florid than biographically enlightening."
"Though clever, Delirious is so light it just keeps threatening to blow away. Candy, who is fine at the center of this, is just not powerful enough to pull it all into him."
Better he should've stayed away.
"Too much of the film is geared around 3-D wizardry. Unneeded sequences pop up for purely ""wow"" baiting."
It's a bad sitcom sprinkled with F-bombs.
"An astoundingly senseless thriller featuring Nicolas Cage, Nicole Kidman, and a band of masked goons. (The word thriller is used very loosely.)"
"Folks! stinks! But Robert Klane's screenplay for this fatally flawed, off-beat, black-humored comedy does have some almost redeeming values."
That an actor exec produced such a film is a sad commentary on where we stand in early-21st century filmmaking.
"The story doesn't work nearly as well in live action, losing the buffer zone of disbelief inherent in Disney's classic animated version."
"Too much of this movie feels made specifically for the movie, which goes directly against its alleged realism, and leaves the audience confused about the point of it all."
"Somewhat predictably, that message has been diluted over the decades - to the point that here, the use of nuclear weapons is celebrated as a good thing, with nary a hint of subtlety or solemnity about their repercussions."
"Dark, unkind psychiatric comedy has drugs, smoking."
"About as interesting as a Blue Plate Special when it could be, considering the talent involved, as richly textured as a fine, aged wine."
"And now, the prequel Hannibal Rising, which answers several questions: Where did Hannibal come from? What made him what he is?... It does not, however, answer the better question: Who fricking cares?"
It looks like this '60s spy spoof series has already lost its mojo.
"A poorly written collection of comic-book movie cliches that offers nothing new to the genre, generates very little in the way of action thrills and plays like a self-important, humorless rip-off of Kill Bill."
"The film doesn't teem; it just seems cluttered - a collection of scenes, and occasionally great visuals or gags, strung together by an inadequate plot."
"The Other Boleyn Girl is the kind of potted historical drama that's not good enough to take seriously and, sadly, not bad enough to be any fun."
"If it was not for Morgan's goofy character or Katt Williams, I would be giving this movie a zero."
"there's a deficit of youthful vitality, sincerity and insight to be felt here"
"Something about the large scope of the action confounds Stallone, and his excessively large number of unit directors. It's too hectic, too confusing to be cool, or exhilirating."
"For all its big moments, Race 3 just does not work up the feeling of suspense and intrigue that made the previous masala movies from the franchise a guilty pleasure."
It&#8217;s possible to be a bit awed by the &#8220;JFK&#8221; ambition of &#8220;88&#44;&#8221; even if the execution waters down Eromose&#8217;s message to the point where we wonder if he&#8217;s simply lost his nerve&#46;
"Despite a superb cast, artful set design and seductive cinematography, Asylum remains a lovingly lensed missed opportunity."
"It's sumptuously designed, has some catchy tunes and an A-list cast voicing anthropomorphic household appliances. Still, Disney's live-action remake of its 1991 animated feature is, by and large, underwhelming."
Features bursts of humor and electrifying energy offset by speechifying and a dud of a subplot.
"This old-fashioned melodrama tips its fateful hand too early and shatters suspense. Despite their off-screen romance, Theron and Townsend have zero on-screen chemistry."
"There is no mystery in Stoker, only ''style,'' and a stultifying sense that the world's been rigged with evil."
It works on an aesthetic level but it's uneven as a drama.
Horror audiences should come to realize that Hollywood hates them if this is the best effort they could provide after making the same movie twice.
I think I can feel it disappearing from my mind even as I am trying to remember it... It's Baron Cohen going at 50mph rather than 100mph.
"""The Internship"" doesn't fail miserably, it just never takes a shot at success. It exists, and as has probably been the fate of many an intern at a huge internet company, it's forgotten about almost immediately."
"How we got from the optimism of Rabin to the bullying of Netanyahu is a fascinating, depressing story, and one that demands greater examination than Moreh is willing to give."
"What the picture represents, in a very real way, is the death of cinema."
Imagine if you salvaged a grubby VHS tape off the roadside only to discover it contained outtakes from an amateur Jackass knock-off.
"Pinter's pauses, and the dour air of so much of the interplay, just don't fit on a story that's this slight."
"Director Scott Derrickson demonstrates a knack for atmosphere but little sense of pacing; some sequences are effectively spooky (particularly one set at the Bronx Zoo), though just as many feel uninspired."
Full of bluster and gimmickry. Does anyone involved even remember the original movie?
The whole idea is just so 15 minutes ago.
"I'm guessing that, aside from the accent, Reiner cast Harrelson in order to capture the likeable side of the character: If only he had trusted his actor simply to act the part."
"A film that, despite Plummer's powerful turn, proves too pulpy for its underlying theme about unpunished war criminals-as well as one that serves as a sad reminder of the heights that its director once reached."
Things that crack up these guys leave other people straight-faced. Some of the mugging and quirky line readings probably should have been excised.
"The Rise of Skywalker is a pitiful attempt to wrap up all nine films, an experience so whittled down by the corporate process that it falls completely flat."
"It's an unexciting story, told in an excited manner..."
A stunning misfire.
Its inert drama and dopey new-agey messaging come off as more condescending than inspirational.
"She's possessed, although she's lifeless. Sort of like the movie."
The animation is rudimentary and imagination virtually absent.
Minor league actor could use pinch hitter.
"There's no reason a film can't stay cinematically interesting while still reflecting the internal repression of its characters and, unfortunately, coupled with the staged nature of the later dialogue, the sober segments of the story don't quite hit home."
Schaeffer should take the advice of his own movie's title the next time he thinks about coercing some poor actress into making a fool of herself.
"The Forever Purge succumbs to the same blandness that prevails through the series. If this truly is the end of The Purge franchise, it ends with a whimper, not a bang."
"But apart from title cards that bookend the film, every plot advancement feels rushed-through, truncated or undeveloped."
&apos;The Loneliest Boy in the World&apos; is a pastel zombie throwback of sitcom terror whose innate wholesomeness can&#8217;t compensate for the sense that these undead themes have walked a hundred times before&#46;
"'Lakeview Terrace' begins as a tense, compelling tale of ideological opposites headed for an ugly clash and ends in contrived melodrama as Abel completes his transformation from badge-waving bully to bogeyman."
"The film dwells a bit too much on North's unpleasant campaign strategist, Mark Goodin."
"Stewart seems to be declaring on every frame of Rosewater, but his knack for dealing with dry subject matter in all kinds of hilarious ways would have worked wonders. It's almost cruel how he turns the film into such a humorless bore."
"The movie insists that people need to self-censor in regard to social media. If not, the state should step in."
"Not that Sex And The City has ever been lauded for its subtlety and grace, but this really is the closest to a Carry On film that the franchise has come so far."
Boll is back and as bad as ever.
"The film is just fine, but there’s only so far I can go with this kind of screenwriting."
It's the kind of movie that could have been a guilty pleasure but ends up being just not very good.
Tries too hard to be hyper and not hard enough to be clever.
"As was the case with most of the AIP exploitation programmers it fondly recalls, Grindhouse proves more entertaining to anticipate than actually to watch."
There are so many secondary characters and narrative strands introduced and forgotten that a scorecard should have been handed out as we sat down.
"It's not just that the numbers are berserkly bad; they also don't seem to have any emotional connection to this bedraggled, Dickensian waif."
"The more complicated it gets the less interesting it becomes; the joke is just overloaded, and at almost two hours, too long."
"If you need any indication of the recycled business going on in Hollywood Homicide, check out the extended cop-donut gags."
"The rest of the plot is... at times witty and at times quite reiterative, piling on references and genres with a certain self-confidence, but with nothing really new to offer. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Sadly, by the time we get to much of the action, it doesn't have any weight. Why build such a real world if you're not going to populate it with interesting people?"
The laughs never come.
The shallow themes and contrivances of Femme Fatale aren't enough to justify the flashy De Palma technique or the blatant exploitation of eroticism.
"When Jamie Kennedy wakes up from 20 years in a coma and still thinks he's in the 1980s, the results are kind of funny -- for about 5 minutes."
"The film is a humongous, ice cold, fanged moneymaking machine brought to life by Hollywood suits who were angry that they passed on remaking Cheaper by the Dozen years back."
"Messy and frequently unfunny ... [An] awkward mishmash of repetitive jokes about being middle-aged women, with some sci-fi and musical theater elements that mostly fall flat ... It will just make people appreciate Bridesmaids even more."
"an ambitious mess of a movie that stretches a thin premise across a bold canvas, resulting in moments of near ecstasy mixed with a nagging lack of emotional involvement"
"Bier surely means well, but the road to compassion porn is paved with noble intentions, laced with a nakedly commercial appeal that flatters moviegoers with a vision of the West as Africa's savior from itself."
How can one take a movie seriously that doesn't take itself seriously?
"Part of the filmmakers' point is that any old nutcase might be lurking behind the drawn curtains of the house next to you in just such an anonymous locale. Still makes for a mighty limiting, boring place to set a movie, though."
It's a beautiful-looking film full of dubious narrative choices and no surprises for anyone familiar with the elements of contemporary fantasy filmmaking.
"Sleeping With Other People is pure fluff, not nearly as subversive as it wants to be."
Another in a long line of bad films set in the Midwest.
"Mikkelsen becomes a background player next to Green; he withholds, she combusts."
"Perhaps the saddest thing about ""The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee"" is that Paul Hogan has still got it even in his 80s. His deadpan, nothing phases me attitude almost makes this ludicrous project work."
"The kind of good-natured dumb silliness that's hard to stay mad at, like an idiotic puppy."
"The Core follows such a familiar path that you can predict not only which crew members are going to be martyred, but in what order."
"No matter her audacity, the Material Girl is only as good as her material, and Madonna has only half a movie here."
" Tedious, vapid and, much like its dull title, unimaginative."
"Here it is, the goofiest movie of the year, a movie so bad in so many different and endearing ways that I'm damned if I don't feel genuine affection for it."
"""Stoker"" plays out like a Kabuki ""Macbeth"": gallons of style slathered on a story you already know by heart."
"Imagine David Mamet rewriting his political satire Wag the Dog as a joke-free kidnap drama. Or don't imagine, just pony up for the glum spectacle of Spartan."
Insufferably naive.
The rattling whispers of political critique come off as fledgling efforts to give the film an importance above what it is
"Given Argento's willingness to attempt the controversial book at all, she pulls a surprising number of punches."
"As busted-but-pretty inspirational sci-fi epics of the recent past go, I'll take Tomorrowland and its wacky, zippy action over Interstellar; Tomorrowland isn't that bad a place to visit, but it's hard to imagine wanting to live there."
"It succumbs to a simplistic plot and a suffocating overload of sentimentality, at times so sweet it could give Mr. Rogers diabetes."
About as fun as a mandatory school field trip.
[It] will please series aficionados but leave newcomers mostly fidgety and baffled.
The two first segments house some charming interludes amidst the meandering framework but the final segment largely falls flat despite being the most weighty section.
"The plot is moth-eaten, the jokes lame, the action sequences idiotic to disgusting, and the whole adds up (or subtracts down) to a complete waste of time."
Just because nobody's going to see it doesn't make its existence ok.
"Seriously, the perfect man would call social services."
This tiresome movie feels too flimsy for the waters beyond the film festival circuit.
"Performances can get you a long way, but when you reduce such important events to a mere montage, then justice is clearly not being done to them and the memory of Mandela's years of struggle."
"The stars are pleasant but unexciting, the goofy ensemble has a few moments of hilarity but never catches fire, the laughs are very scattered and the film's title is a self-fulfilling prophecy."
There are more consequences of his situations than there are laughs derived from them. Not everyone around here is a Howard Stern.
"Mediocre, slightly sloppy and a mild waste of a great cast."
"Haunting artistry aside, it's hard to see what Egoyan brings to the table that hasn't already been covered in print (Mara Leveritt's book provides source material), on screen and elsewhere in the media."
An implausible story that enfolds kinky sex with nationalistic fervor.
It's a Nightmare on Elm Street movie as badly written and performed as a Friday the 13th movie.
"Sidekicks exist to steal the show, not carry it like Tow Mater is asked to do in Cars 2. The redneck rust bucket is on screen so much that 3-D glasses should come with tetanus shots."
"Baruchel's passion is still present and appreciated, but he's capable of so much more, especially as a first-time feature director. He shoots, but he doesn't quite score."
Another powerful children's story dulled into mediocrity by the worship of technology.
Heather Graham's would-be singer-songwriter in Broken is a walking clich in a film overstuffed with them.
"Three-year-old, brain-dead variant of Risky Business."
"It's not that I don't believe in love at first sight; I do. But this love is so sugar coated and sickly, I just didn't believe in it for a moment."
These guys are like glorified Harry Potter characters.
Another half-success spoiled by tonal uncertainty.
"If this is director Attal's attempt to dive into the complex world of marriages, he barely swam past the shoreline."
"A film can only be as riveting as its ability to have the audience believe or suspend belief, and though The Town takes steps toward authenticity, it fails to meet even the basic requirements of plausibility."
The movie shouldn't open in the Museum of Natural History but the Museum of the Moving Image -- with a display of chick-flick clichés through the ages.
"There's so much to like about the picture in theory: a sophisticated literary adaptation with a distinguished cast, geared toward grown-ups, only gently suggesting itself as a tentpole. But Branagh just can't find a tone that works."
"Superlative performances from Roberts and Hammer almost cover the shortcomings. Like most Tarsem films it's a muddle, but this time not one with enough distracting dazzle."
"At more than two hours long, and with so many logistical flaws, emotional misses, and really, a missed purpose, The 355 blows its cover."
"A potentially enjoyable B movie, but the absurd plot twist brings it down to a Z."
"The film comes closer to doing for firearms what ""Jurassic Park 3"" did for dinosaurs. It showed lots of 'em, had them kill a few people and made you wish it would end sooner than it did."
"Teller, Mara and company are very capable young actors who bring sensitivity and humour to their roles, but that isn't necessarily what audiences want from Marvel-era superhero blockbusters."
"... yet another in a seemingly endless line of Hollywood extravaganzas about clashing cultures and strangers in strange lands, filtering its drama through a star stand-in."
Only the movie's last stretch manages to get to the place the movie seems to want to go: a weird balance between imagination and reality.
"It takes everything that was fresh and assertive about the original and transforms it into vile, hateful overkill."
"A lot happens in this movie, but much of it is unexplained."
Murphy looks comatose delivering the played-out poopy jokes.
"Trapped in a perilous zone between TV and cinema, this wartime conspiracy thriller ploughs through an improbable plot with all the urgency of a snail going through wet concrete."
"Once it becomes obvious that there's no discernible arc at hand for Ingrid, a sense of inevitability sets in and the unpleasantness of the characters begins to wear."
For a film that revisits the frequently explored idea that human beings are working at only a fraction of their full capacity - remember Limitless and Lucy? - it often comes across as being in desperate need of a swift kick in the butt.
"A story lurching moment-to-moment for inspiration, or full of ceaseless gags about every bodily fluid, or featuring rape jokes or the sight of Franco spitting food into Hill's mouth, doesn't pass as wit."
Don't be surprised if your child asks to watch Brave or Shrek again when it's over.
Between the muddled satirical jabs and the unsympathetic characters&#44; it leaves a sour taste&#46;
The Sweetest Thing wanders into such ironies and shoddily exploits them. The title is even a bad joke: This movie is to sweet as a dog is to a hydrant.
"Writer-director Ann Turner has dealt with similar themes of fear, paranoia and seduction before, but Irresistible is her first tilt at a Hollywood-style genre film. It's an interesting try and the performances are good, but the suspense sags."
The best I can say for this is that a Guest fan might find it moderately entertaining.
A film almost entirely devoid of personality.
"Basicamente mergulhando a trama de Star Wars no universo de J.R.R. Tolkien, Eragon traz anões, elfos, humanos, dragões, feiticeiros e Vaders (ops... Vardens) envolvidos em incidentes que são um verdadeiro bê-á-bá do gênero fantasia."
"lt's as if ""Airplane"" were a jam session in which fine musicians, through their spontaneity and improvisational talents, made noticeable improvements in a second-rate score, and ""Top Secret"" were the same tune, played note-for-note as written."
"Tries to be a lot of different things: heist thriller, feminist statement, social-issue diagnosis. That's a lot to bite off, and 129 minutes isn't enough time for proper chewing."
An instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product.
"The whole thing is, somehow, even worse than you'd imagine, and the sound is particularly poor, although this may be considered a positive under the circumstances."
"The biggest letdown is Shirley MacLaine as...the magical, meddling Endora.... She doesn't just phone it in, she refuses to pick up the receiver."
"I suffered through this movie so you don't have to - unless you really, truly feel like wasting ninety minutes of your life."
A tired remake of the usual dance movies.
As cool as the concept is&#44; the writing is just not up to snuff&#46;
Feels like the first reel of Bridget Jones's Diary spliced onto Othello.
Strictly by the numbers -- you can almost hear all four screenwriters counting off the obligatory plot points one by one.
If you didn't like the first film ... well ... best to walk away now.
"There's a Jekyll-and-Hyde dynamic at work here. While the movie at its core boasts a fun, fast-moving vibe, its awkward, franchise-serving midsection undermines much of that."
"Some of the Marvel (and DC) franchises do feel a bit past their use-by date. “It’s never over,” Kang says at one point. He speaks the truth, for better or worse."
"A good-hearted but largely uninspired, by-the-numbers bit of Netflix filler."
"In the not-so-grand tradition of other straight-to-video/late-night-cable T&A-fests, the trouble with Zombie Strippers is that it doesn't come about its exploitation honestly."
Failures in cohesion and storytelling sensibilities abound.
"""Hustle"" attempts to bring a different style to the forefront of popular cinema but fails to be more than a shoddy mischaracterization of the Asian culture."
"With Shang-Chi, we have on our hands perhaps the least essential MCU affair since Mickey Rourke was throwing laser whips around Robert Downey Jr's head."
...a suprisingly unmoving and pessimistic journey filled with forgettable character stereotypes and no sense of humor.
"Lawrence and Bardem deliver adequate performances, but the plot and story are one big heap of confusion."
"It's rare that a movie makes me ill these days, and it's rare that I can see a movie and hate the people behind it with such abhorrence, but ""Meet the Spartans"" rises to the challenge..."
"A sort of modern film noir peopled by flawed figures with bleak prospects, one that offers a pervasively downbeat ambience but not much dramatic insight."
"[Bey] steals every scene he's in. Unfortunately, in a film this pallid, that amounts to petty theft."
An artful experiment that only half works.
"Tears of the Sun may make you weep, but not for joy."
"To put it in the reference-heavy parlance of The Gray Man: It's The Cringe Ultimatum, baby."
Writer/director Jerome Sable fills his script full of so many leftover plot elements and references to other movies that it chokes the life right out of it.
A comedy that takes itself too seriously to be truly enjoyed.
"Though it has many engaging moments (mostly in its first 40 minutes, out of 150), producer/director Sydney Pollack's attempt to dramatize Isak Dinesen's years as a pioneer farmer in Kenya ultimately fails as drama and as romance."
"It's three hours of muddy, gruesome machismo dialled up to eleven and drowning in indecipherable grunts and growls, without anything to justify its existence beyond winning Leonardo DiCaprio an Academy Award."
"Boy, it's hard not to keep thinking that this movie is basically Yentl with a nose job."
Even though Jason Mitchell is quite strong... [Tyrel] goes in no direction at all.
"It's a pity, because few romcoms pull off the basically sympathetic mining of personal vanities and social embarrassment that the film manages in its opening hour."
"A sad, gloomy, self indulgent, and adult comedy about the irrationality of love. [Full review in Spanish]"
The only good thing about this supernatural thriller is that the atheist finally comes to see that most of the evil in the world is caused not by Satan but by human fear and hatred.
... neither shocking nor insightful as it scrutinizes the recklessness of contemporary teens with appropriate cynicism.
"While everything looks incredibly life-like, it reveals that there are particular limitations of reality that run into conflict with the needs of the storytelling, and that's a problem that it struggles to overcome."
A Will Ferrell vehicle customized with some potentially provocative red states satire and a message that so-called cutting and running may be smarter than winning at any cost.
"It feels dated visually, its narrative is spotty and its characters too broadly defined. On the whole, ""Tomorrowland"" plays like ""Interstellar"" for 8 year-olds with Disney's animatrons thrown in for no discernible reason."
Glazer&#8217;s debut is more style than substance&#44; as most debut-noirs are&#46;
The Burning Sea is a formulaic disaster flick with no imagination or engaging personalities. Viewers can easily predict what happens and then quickly forget the movie. The movie's environmental message is cheapened by too many stupid scenarios.
Hillcoat is clearly fascinated by the ever-increasing gap between America's rich and poor. A shame he can't turn that crisis into a credible drama.
This unusual effort never really finds a productive direction for its considerable wit and rambunctious energy.
"Spider-Man: Far From Home, even with its charming subplot of teen love and angst, is just another super hero movie."
"A CGI-filled behemoth, with little weight or impact to its monotonous action sequences."
"The film insists on avoiding the deeper psychological and even existential implications of its own tale, implications present in the narrative but somehow skipped over or ignored."
A mostly gimmicky slog.
"Buena Vista Home Entertainment has released a batch of early Roger Corman films.... They're all trash, but Big Bad Mama is the chicken bone you can choke on."
"With its over-reliance on a familiar narrative that prevents audiences from delving deeper into Franklin's life, Respect feels like more of a dis-respect to the Queen of Soul."
"Look, this isn't supposed to be Serious Cinema. I get that. I also know that there is a cinematic place for over-the-top action. I also know that it doesn't have to be stupid, because I saw ""Mad Max: Fury Road."""
full review in Greek
"Agonizingly paced and bewilderingly outdated, Ben Stiller's long-awaited sequel is a sad march through every single joke from the 2001 original."
"Unfortunately, most of the jokes just aren't very funny."
"This is not a film about love, and all the joy, pain and heartbreak that comes along with it; but it sure does feel endless."
Ridiculous.
"Unfortunately, first-time director Mike Cahill spends an inordinate amount of time dealing with the nuances of the hunt and caper and, even with his attempts to add in a dash of comedy, he can't redeem this aspect of the project."
"Netflix certainly makes the attempt by packing this new take with attractive faces, extravagant production design and a curious lack of bite."
"Campion is a master director, more about poetry than cinematic energy. An uneasy watch but a destructive investigation on feminism and family...but ultimately all a chore to watch."
"A truly execrable dirge that fails to satisfy a single element of coherent contemporary film-making, except, perhaps, for the initial one-line pitch."
The film looks as though the bulk of the budget was reserved for ammo.
"'American Ultra,' a sloppy mess of an action-comedy that wastes a killer premise by taking itself just a little too seriously."
'Angry Birds' never really takes flight.
"There are so many better ways to waste two hours: C-Span highlights; an ""E! Hollywood Story"" on Tyne Daly; a good old-fashioned case of the flu accompanied by a trashy Movie of the Week: you name it."
"""Cut Bank"" fades into the background while its veteran actors look for ways to keep interested."
A film teetering on the edge of importance.
"If you want to see ignorant self destruction, see Troy Duffy in ""Overnight"" and forget this film---the worst mistake Josh Hartnett has made in his career."
"The whole film seems ideologically forced and out of place, an attempt to resurrect the retentive virtues of Ford and Hawks without the cultural context that gave them expressive strength."
"The eye is sated, but the mind wanders."
"These characters never really existed, we feel, in any place/time except Wish Fulfilment Land."
"""The Counselor"" is a disaster on nearly every level, but it all starts with McCarthy's muddled, mean-spirited screenplay."
"Most of the characters and their stories don't get enough time to feel fleshed out. (Full Content Review for Parents - Profanity, Sexual Material, etc. - also Available)"
"Mortdecai is the stuff that inspires stipulations in wills, as in, 'Have some basic decency on the event of my passing, and don't let people bring up that one movie.'"
"The Sentinel is one of those well-oiled-machine movies from Hollywood that's slick in an inoffensive way, efficient in a give-the-viewers-what-they-want way. It has no personality per se, but that's what a picture like this is all about."
The fatal flaw of John Singleton's latest and most mainstream offering is an off-the-rails narrative that adds up to one giant 'Huh?'
"From the beginning this film looks like promising something substantial, glossy and stylish but ends up just being expensively bland."
"There's almost no conflict in either of the stories presented in Julie & Julia, and though this is preferable to contrived conflict, it still leaves us with a rather overlong, lovey-dovey picture."
"""Tammy"" is a movie that is painful, pathetic, and more willing to engage in a joke about getting fingered by Boz Scaggs than anything even remotely introspective."
"A stoner's delight that is part fever dream and part bad trip, Inherent Vice is a dark and wickedly wild neo-noir romp. But it's also a thing of unusual density and often incoherence."
"Super 8 is a loving, heartfelt but hollow pastiche."
"There's something off with the hosts, yes, but also with the whole movie."
"For teenaged metalheads who don't know any better, this may seem like fun."
"Breaking In is derivative, banal and devoid of tension."
"Once the truth is all revealed, it all feels very meh, and you find yourself saying ohh ok – that’s a decision. The editing confused the watcher at times..."
That's what you get from A Dog's Purpose: emotional torture porn of the canine variety. Its sole purpose is cheap emotional manipulation.
Blonde is a soap opera without the soap&#46;
There is absolutely nothing to distract us from the sheer misery of watching oblivious clowns cracking awful jokes.
"While they attempt to provide reasons to become emotionally attached to characters, it's a big ask."
"All of this predictability and retreading of the same old formula just makes for one long, stretched-out film that leaves the audience waiting for the inevitable to happen."
"Environmentalists will tell you that recycling is a good thing but the Adam Sandler vehicle ""The Longest Yard"" goes out of its way to prove otherwise."
This is a film so thunderingly unfunny that it makes 'White Chicks' look like 'Blazing Saddles.'
"You do get used to the feline antics after a while, and if that were the biggest problem, ""Cats"" might still work at a certain level. The bigger issue is that the film completely lacks tension or any real semblance of plot or story."
"This film has its pleasing moments, and is beautiful to look at, with more over-the-top wigs than you can shake a stick at... But the characters do not connect to each other and we therefore cannot connect with it."
"Clichéd in every department, with predictable plot, stage-managed coincidences, and a widgee-faced boy hero. Critters is saved From a Z-rating by its sly, tongue-in-cheek humour and expertly-created munchkin stars."
Shanghai Noon was fun and Shanghai Knights is more of the same -- just not as much fun.
Tammy Faye doesn't cut deep enough into its relevant subject matter.
"Grimaces its way through 85 long, low-key minutes just to marvel again and again that, gosh, mommies really love their babies."
The whole film feels stingy and vacuous. And it's only barely trashy enough to be fun.
Despite some eye-popping&#44; adrenaline-fueled action sequences&#44; it&apos;s overall more familiar than fresh&#46; The raptors and T-rexes are still as menacing as ever&#44; but without the distinct sense of awe or wonder they once inspired&#46;
It&#8217;s stuck&#44; charmingly and a little wanly&#44; in another era&#46;
"They have pruned, or purged, the drama until it runs just over an hour and a half, and, in so doing, mislaid its nervous languor."
"Soderbergh’s gaze is so coldly appraising when bodies aren’t in motion that money emerges as the shaping force, not character, and every beat is in service to it."
"Deutch has no discernible style; the scenes march ahead with only one development per scene, much like the worst in American television."
... here's hoping that Truth or Dare tanks and we don't have to endure a spate of horror films based on innocuous party games.
The visuals are awesome but Snyder didn't do enough with the great concepts that he introduced. It was shot beautifully but that's the only positive about this film.
"A frustrating ending to a stellar career, a cramped and melancholy film about a cramped and melancholy man."
Anyone can guess the outcome of this mildly charming yet woefully predictable romantic comedy&#46;
"A botched remake...A real thriller has you on the edge of your seat; watching this one, you're more liable to sit back and snooze."
"It's a fable, you see, and fables rarely have any substance. And being populated by stick figures, they are rarely compelling."
"Even in her own account, Jane Hawking is not a compelling woman. This does not make her unimportant - just not an ideal subject for a feature-length film."
"Nijinsky says, 'I know how to suffer' and if you see this film you'll know too."
von Donnersmarck has gone Hollywood - and I can't wait for him to go back to Germany.
"Just because these two pretty people flirted and pratfell well once, doesn't mean they can do it again--especially when they're trying to do it with such a clunker of a script on their hands."
There are lots of slasher movies better than this.
"On the whole, though, Cars 3 feels like a typical sports movie: not meant for me, but amusing enough to keep me from falling asleep."
Did these people - or even these people's people - not bother to read the script first?
"Miss Brooks is attractive and she moves her head and eyes at the proper moment, but whether she is endeavoring to express joy, woe, anger or satisfaction it is often difficult to decide."
Well of course he wins the race and gets the girl.
The transition from the slopes of Sundance to the hard streets of everywhere else is the artistic equivalent of the bends.
"Hampered by a dull leading performance, Marc Foster and screenwriter David Benioff's adaptation of Khaled Hosseini's hugely popular novel skimps on the book's real value in favor of bland melodrama and absurd dramatics."
The rest of the film is a drag.
Everything here is mashed together into a postmodern pileup that thinks it's politically progressive and smart but really isn't.
"This movie tries to gaslight you into thinking its central baddie is actually well-thought-out (and is, presumably, worthy of sequels that God willing won't happen), when really it's the most generic crap, both in terms of substance and character design."
"Like the man at the centre of it, the film seems defined and limited by its stoicism."
Makes me mad just thinking about it.
"This potentially shattering film becomes too comfortable and pat, lacking in menace."
George C&#46; Scott&apos;s casting hints at the dichotomy at play in this schizophrenic project&#46; Like the movie itself&#44; he&apos;s eminently watchable but also scarcely believable&#46;
"Arriaga's film beats his audience over the head with the pain of its characters but provides no release, no lessons, and no relatable humanity. It's film for masochists only."
"So far, this is the worst movie of the year."
Just not particularly amusing.
"The Schrader variation is awfully dull, with scant evidence of the sort of things that make horror movies attractive -- like mounting suspense and spine-tingling creepiness and, oh yeah, the element of horror."
The Truth About Emanuel is as confusing a film as it is a beautiful one.
By the end of the film you get the feeling that Depp himself is wondering just how much longer he can fake the funk for a paycheck.
"It is one thing for a movie to be boring and awful, but it is quite another to be insulting, in bad taste, and utterly ridiculous at the same time."
The only grade this school deserves is an F.
"Like most movies aimed at the kindergarten set, Marmaduke balances its giggly, gross-out gags with a stern moral agenda."
"Den of Thieves desperately wants to be Heat or The Killer when it grows up. Instead it's a daft, distant, drunken cousin to those pictures, but if you studiously avoid thinking about it, you can at least enjoy its moronic antics."
There's little doubt that Bliss starts out with a fair degree of promise...
This movie wants to be so many things in its hybrid of stylistic approaches that it distracts too often from the essentials.
Utterly disposable and -- apart from Dwayne Johnson's 'pec pop of love' -- almost immediately forgettable.
Never comes together into anything remotely interesting.
Spy thrillers are supposed to be edge-of-the-seat films but this is too long drawn to be classified as such. It's set up like a chess match and we're supposed to hold our breaths for the denouement. But no one can hold their breath for that long.
There's not nearly enough quality material to make Battle of the Year recommendable to anyone other than the most hard-core of dance fanatics.
"Dilwale is a bizarre love story. SRK has done his share of bizarre love stories in his time, but this one just doesn't get off the ground despite the superstar's best efforts."
Return to sender.
Within Shazam&#33; Fury of the Gods is an enjoyable&#44; earnest buddy-comedy starring Jack Dylan Grazer and Djimon Hounsou&#46; Unfortunately&#44; you have to watch the rest of Shazam&#33; Fury of the Gods to see it&#46;
Doesn't find the rhythm of a caper movie. The most detail we get is how the women want to sneak the cash out in their underpants
I didn't get it.
"As creator and head writer of The West Wing, Aaron Sorkin had a gift for making policy debate seem sexy, but what worked in the context of that liberal fantasy founders badly amid the realpolitik of this cold war drama."
Maybe November wanted to be the missing link between more conventional art-house films and the hallucinogenic dreams of David Lynch. It fails.
"Defenders of the film have argued that it's actually pro-woman, due to the fact that the female lead wins in the end, which is sort of like saying that cockfights are pro-rooster because there's always one left standing."
"For a film that skillfully weaves together so many elements, this muddled low-budget drama remains at an emotional distance."
[I Used to Go Here] recycles run-of-the-mill themes and heavily relies on overused stylistic formulas and indie film prescriptions.
This version of Anna and the King plays it entirely too safe.
"After watching Lee Tamahori's failed, cameo-studded attempt at neo-noir, one can only wonder how it attracted such an interesting array of talent."
"A clich-riddled kid's film whose sole inventive hook is its hand-painted, Cray-Pas-by-way-of-water-colors animation style."
"A movie made with awards season in mind, ""Changeling"" offers extravagant affects and overwritten speeches."
Viewers have to wade through many embarrassing moments (and performances).
"Think Like a Man tries to tackle more characters than it can handle, making for a mess of a film that ultimately feels like a two-hour advertisement for Steve Harvey's book."
"Miss Potter gives us only the bedtime version of the Beatrix Potter story, perhaps appropriately so given the subject matter and target audience, which will likely be captivated by the film's undemanding narrative."
"Cooper intersperses scenes of bloodshed with long scenes where characters have Very Important Things To Say about racism, vengeance and soul-corroding guilt."
Black Mirror for Dummies.
"An Unfinished Life means well, but it's hard to give it much credit beyond that."
"As solid as Cranston, Leguizamo, Kruger, Bratt, and all the rest are, the built-in constraints of the movie format don't do their real-life counterparts full justice."
"Flatliners is moderately entertaining hocum at times, when it doesn't reach too far. Roberts is the best of the adequate bunch -- only her fans should make this a must-see."
A bummer.
"It's rarely boring, but golly it's indulgent."
The cast is energetic but the talent is amateurish and the script is dead on arrival.
"Rumor had it this was gonna be a stinker, and it is."
Whether Jason X is this bad on purpose is never clear. But one thing's for sure: It never comes close to being either funny or scary.
A nasty piece of work.
"With any 'strike while the iron's hot' example of sequel moviemaking, you're bound to trudge through a lot of familiarity in order to find the few worthwhile moments."
From frame one&#44; it is clear where this is going&#44; and instead of trying to challenge or charm&#44; Your Place or Mine settles for a forgettable romance&#44; no matter where you watch it&#46;
"Its chopping-block fodder is agonizingly bland; each character has one prominent major flaw, or no personality at all."
"""Flow"" critiques the commodification of water, which has resulted in increased global inequities."
There's not enough here to justify the almost two hours.
"With no sense of scale, scope, story or how to shoot bruising action, Morel misses the target."
"If gaming is about playing, why would a gamer want to watch movies like this?"
An epic showcase for mediocre CGI and slapdash screenwriting.
I can't see anyone really enjoying this.
"If there were any justice in the world of movies, the film's distributor would gather up all copies of For Your Consideration before it hits theaters and burn them."
Perhaps the Bible needs an 11th Commandment: Thou Shalt Not Bore. That might stem misfires such as The Ten.
"Heslov thinks he's making a Coen Brothers movie, so Clooney and especially Bridges continuously play up how ""off"" they are, but the source material didn't need any help."
Os inúmeros equívocos históricos poderiam ser perdoados caso o filme de Ridley Scott conseguisse sobreviver ao menos como obra de ficção. Não consegue.
"A reasonably fun combination of The Box and Final Destination, in which the protagonist takes far too long to understand the basic premise of the movie."
"With all of the clutter, The DUFF seems to forget, or even disregard, its own empowerment message"
This is more a collection of odd footage than a coherent picture about cat owners. 
Frost is as likeable as ever but it doesn't feel like much Latin passion went into the script.
"One wouldn't think that the overburdened, heavily CG'ed mis-en-scene of Burton's film couldn't be surpassed in terms of sheer candy-colored enormity, but that is precisely what Bobin seems to be going for."
A hideously unfunny spy spoof.
"The characters are just awful. Superficial, inarticulate, mewling dolts. So odious, in fact, that you wonder if this is satire."
"rarely compelling, no matter how hard it tries"
Strictly a vanity vehicle with a mess of star babies on board.
"[Shyamalan's] best film since The Village, which would be a really mean thing to say about anybody who wasn't the auteur behind Lady in the Water."
This year's first Event Movie is almost guaranteed to wind up as its dumbest.
This film is all about mood and atmosphere...not very accessible or intriguing.
One of the most unpleasant viewing experiences of my life.
"Hawn has more to offer than this, and Schumer is the right partner to bring it out of her. But ""Snatched"" isn't the right vehicle for them."
"A highly derivative, confusing, often risible hodgepodge, made up of bits and pieces from other, better sci-fi movies."
"An exercise in idiocy, made all the more tedious by its recognition of its own laziness."
It coulda been a contender.
"In spite of its scruffy look and slack pacing, it often rings as false as any of the big, shiny and soft studio rom-coms (starring Kate Hudson or Katherine Heigl, say) of the last decade."
"It's a gory, depressing affair that bears an ultra-Darwinian message in its blood-stained hands."
This 'Why bother?' spinoff of the '70s undercover cop show is little more than a 99-minute shtickfest built around something resembling a plot.
"While Hava probably gained a lot from the experience of making The Tree of Life, the audience will gain demonstrably less."
What could have been a powerful and poignant exploration of the British music biz ends up being merely above average.
"Bottom line, I didn't laugh as much as I wanted to."
Omnipresent camera-spinnings can't deliver enough slickness to hide Slipstream's half-baked concept and frequently horrific dialogue.
"Clifford, starring Martin Short as a precociously nasty 10-year-old, is not a good movie. It's not even good/bad. But Short has a few of those laugh-out-loud moments."
The Salon had any genuine sass clipped out of it to fit a PG-13 rating.
"Everything is supposed to be a farce, but it plays out like a boring drama. This film makes 'Midnight in Paris' all the more impressive."
"Do NOT waste your time, this film should be extracted from theaters at once."
"When there's this much style and affection on show, it's a shame that the directorial perspective doesn't have the sophistication to match."
The characters are so abrasive and unsympathetic that you wish they'd all just crash and burn.
More a comedy of errors than the black comedy revenge thriller it desires to be&#46;
Justice and Demos are able to spark some credible moments of romantic chemistry&#46; However&#44; this isn&apos;t enough to save the movie from being utterly bland&#46;
... forgettable update of an equally forgettable 1969 farce called 'Cactus Flower.'
"Conventional, predictable ticking-clock thriller. But Jovovich and Brosnan are well-cast as foils, and give fair value in their roles"
An intriguing premise that never quite reaches liftoff.
"It's fun in sporadic bursts, but never memorable."
Do yourself a favor and find the original 30 minute Twilight Zone episode of The Box and watch that instead.
A model case of what can go wrong with an intriguing idea.
"After Meryl Streep sang her dungarees off in Mamma Mia!, I had great hopes for Ricki and the Flash."
"Get Rich's story, inspired by Jackson's life, simply doesn't gel."
"The latest haunted house movie in the venerable ""sort of Insidious except so much worse"" mold."
Retirement's sounding good for 007; we've certainly had more than enough.
"It's like a sketchbook. These are images, tones, dialogue and characters that Wong is sure of, and he practices them, but he does not seem very sure why he is making the movie, or where it should end."
"Regardless of its seemingly admirable intent and ambition, The Laundromat is not a good film. It's sloppy, and self-indulgent, and in no way worthy of the self-satisfaction it brings to its big conclusion."
"With better writing, that pivot would be a fun twist, but Locked Down fails to pull it off. That said, the last 30 minutes of the movie are imminently more fun than what came before it."
"For all the high concept wonders at work, Payne can't seem to break out of his own rut."
A cinematic lump of coal.
They have once again taken a story that is perfect as a half-an-hour tale and padded it to make it longer than it should be.
"We're treated to scenes of unspeakable death and destruction- an entire town pretty much flattened entirely, and the movie glosses right over it"
Myers has his head in the toilet more than a Florida State University freshman co-ed during homecoming weekend.
"The fun of the idea in Cop 3 is the notion of a huge, corny, funny-animal park, with cops and killers running around in the tunnels. But the movie gets drowned in casual brutalism, lazy shtick and telegraphed jokes."
We can buy that this kid is a dangerous weirdo; it's harder to buy him as an example of superhuman strength and mental fortitude.
"If Minions were a toy, you'd hide its batteries."
Part of the problem is its length&#46; At just over two hours&#44; the final act drags like an actual football game playing out in real time&#46; 
"It turns out the real question director Roland Emmerich's movie raises isn't about how much this film's pseudo-science teases us, but how much bad drama it's willing to blow our way."
"What could have explored the real complexities behind a serious issue instead became a self-congratulatory pat on the back for holding a specific viewpoint, and a boring one at that."
Pugh once again is the only thing drawing our attention in a film that fails to dig below the surface of religion&#44; the patriarchy and medical mystery until it is all but flashing a sign on the screen by the end telling you what it&#8217;s big metaphor is&#46;
"'Everybody's Talking About Jamie' is inoffensive enough. However, given the subject matter, it might have been worthwhile to give a bit more offense."
"The film was one big tedious contrivance, but for trying so hard deserves a Gentleman's C."
Utterly ridiculous and not worth your time.
Skip this and get your kids to watch a Fellini movie instead.
"The storyline is driven by too many nick-of-time scenarios, the repetitive nature of which gradually decrease their impact."
"[Charlie Kaufman's] follow-up to [Being John Malkovich] is just weird, although it certainly does have its moments."
"This version quickly falls in and out of form, deviating from comedy to thriller...losing the social significance of the original."
There's no getting around that a great deal of this movie is tedious and predictable.
"Insane and repetitive, but fans will lap (ahem) up this brainless, nitrate-injected sequel."
a cheesily bombastic film&#44; full of alpha male characters all constantly vying to get in the pants of the only woman in their midst&#44; and endlessly alienating viewers with their masculine swagger and aggressive rivalry&#46; 
Not as insightful as it desperately tries to be
An aura of disappointment takes hold midway into Golden Compass and becomes undeniable by the finish.
Doom borrows gimmicks from other sci-fi/horror movies -- and not very well -- without creating enough of its own to do the trick.
Without a paddle lives up to its name; it sinks.
It's easy to like Mars Callahan -- the writer-director-star of `Poolhall Junkies' -- but the problem is he seems to like himself even more.
"What would Jay Silverheels say? Tonto laugh at bad movie, cannot fix with editing, much money wasted."
"The actors are splendid, especially Sarah Polley and Sean Penn, but we never feel confident that these two plots fit together, belong together, or work together."
"A parking garage chase is impressive, but Wan's ultra-kitschy use of melancholy indie-pop music at moments of intense emotion transforms the movie into pure camp."
"It contains some useful information, I suppose, but I did not like these people, I hope never to meet them, and I wonder if the world wouldn't be a better place without them."
"If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the better version."
"It pretty much goes without saying that the script by Chris Morgan, who penned most of the previous installments, is achingly stupid and beyond ludicrous."
"A relentless procession of animated mayhem that has little to do with classical storytelling, and everything to do with the imperative of cynically pandering to short attention spans."
"With every caption dancing across the screen to overstate the obvious, it plays like a feature-length PSA for thetruth.com - only this time, the drug is kidnapping."
Shattering both your low expectations and will to live&#44; Netflix&#8217;s Carter is an action film so ridiculous that you&#8217;ll often wish that you were among the scores of faceless villains whose heads are smashed to a pulp by the film&#8217;s protagonist&#46;
"A film of impeccable style, with every note hit to perfection, but without much soul."
"What you miss most is the shamelessness and wit that Anna Faris and Regina Hall have brought to four installments of Scary Movie. In lieu of those two, there are exploding pimples, a tongue frozen on a pole, and industrial-strength projectile."
An overheated melodrama that plays like an art-house version of the gloriously awful Wild Orchid.
Out of Time seems out of another time and place.
The whole name thing is just a below-the-line technicality in relation to the grand weirdness Lemercier serves up in paying tribute to the French-Canadian pop goddess.
"Awkwardly amusing homicidal humor, and subliminally suggesting a bizarre notion about suicide bombers, that if you can't beat 'em, laugh at 'em. Which is to say, that this cheesy thriller is on the tasteless side, and we're not talking pizza."
"Fixing the malfunctioning Avalon requires addressing the fundamental damage, but the film seems to argue that the same does not hold true for the human heart."
"The movie plays not like an old man's film but like a promising, frustrating student effort."
"The snail's-pace horizontal pans, under-the-flight-path score, and other arthouse affectations had collided with the overall unlikeability of the major characters violently enough to make me consider jumping ship."
"It's certainly possible to enjoy the movie's canny crowd-pleasing (or pandering) calculation; but even before it's over, you'll know you've been had."
"A distant, uninvolving experience &#8230; characters and emotions, even by the archetypal standards of high fantasy, never come to life, and the overarching mythology seems too self-consciously contrived."
Makes fun of parents' murdering their children. A flop that lacks even entertainment value.
"Fall is weighed down by some labored soap-operatic revelations and other missteps, not least a running time (107 minutes) way too padded to sustain this ordeal’s maximum tension. It’s ultimately more contrived than it is exciting."
"With its narrative slight and familiar, and its sense of drama and threat muted, it relies upon its roster of recognisable properties - and the affection everyone has for them, especially off-screen - to provide interest."
"Don't be fooled. The movie is bad -- very, very bad."
This softcore thriller runs strictly by the numbers.
"It's all too earnest, to the point of serving, unwittingly or otherwise, as an apologia."
"Obviously designed to entertain the general masses, the film has its winning moments and performances, but unfortunately contains just as many problems."
"The equivalent of trying to sneak an issue of Newsweek into the house, rolled up inside a copy of Mad magazine."
Isn't worth the crayons it took to write the script.
Annabelle Comes Home is a brainless sequel that telegraphs every scare. It never deviates from the standard horror movie formula.
"The Express raises the following rhetorical question: Was Davis' life really that by-the-numbers bland or have the filmmakers airbrushed out all the prickly, complicated details?"
"The whole film has a cobbled-together feel, almost as if Soderbergh only directed some key scenes and left the rest to someone else."
"Instead of leaning into the inherent creepiness ... co-writer/director Andrew Desmond bypasses that for a dull, exposition-heavy scavenger hunt."
Bula Quo! is absolute nonsense of the highest order.
"Travolta crime thriller has mob violence, cursing."
"Director Richard Loncraine and screenwriter Joe Forte run out of ideas. So they turn to the action-movie mainstays -- guns, fisticuffs and explosions -- in an over-the-top showdown that tries to make up in mayhem what it lacks in credibility."
"It's an entirely serviceable sequel. But if you go in expecting the same magic found in Wardrobe, you're bound to be disappointed."
Gerry is a fascinating idea for a movie -- can you make a movie so boring that it transcends boredom? -- but not a fascinating movie.
"Cool premise and eerie buildup from the first hour, ultimately downshifts into an unsatisfying film that drags long past its bedtime, and turns into a gobbledygook of psychological head games and illusions."
"For all the hard-fought realism, brilliant performances, and the feelings stirred up by the themes of mortality and late-life romance, there is the inescapable silliness of the central conceit."
"Racing Stripes is oddly torn in tone: is it an old-fashioned family drama, a coming-of-age story or a crass comedy? Live action or animation? Unlike Babe, it fails to integrate its conflicting personalities."
"Unfair though it might be to compare this movie to that ground-breaking work, it's hard not to wish for more of a sense of discovery."
"An exercise in navel-gazing, and worse."
"McFarland, USA is well-intentioned and largely inoffensive, but as any coach knows, good intentions aren't enough to go the distance."
"Young children might be transported to this galaxy, but parents will be wishing they were back in Zootopia."
"By the time the Mummy and the Scorpion King and countless curses and corpses and corps of dog-headed skeletons have returned and been ravaged, you might be feeling little mummified yourself."
"Glacially slow going, and reveals more about the minutiae of Iranian burial customs than most viewers will probably want to know."
"Savage Grace contemplates passion without sampling it, though, and the film quickly becomes as remote as a magazine spread."
Lone Scherfig's everything-is-connected ensemble film never comes together.
"Yes, this is a genuinely so-bad-it's-good movie. This film is crushingly awful, tedious and moronic, but I was often howling with laughter."
Democrats and Republicans alike will likely come together in this case to agree that the film is too slowly paced and meandering to be galvanizing.
Leterrier handles his camera like a Swingball set. Sleight-of-hand has seldom felt slighter than this.
"Despite the excellently creepy subject matter, The Tall Man contains very little actual horror and ends up being quite a dud."
"Considering the nature of the production, it's no wonder that Hitch never gets inside any of the characters"
Too bad what begins as a cheerfully irreverent comedy in the tradition of Animal House gets all pious when it slams fraternity culture at neighboring Harmon College.
"The Damned United is a populist - at times, almost cartoonish - attempt to make comprehensible the story behind Brian Clough's ill-fated 44-day tenure at Leeds United."
"Curtis has said he may stop making movies, and on the basis of this film you can kind of see why: he's clearly in a rut"
"All is By My Side amounts to a series of imagined conversations, with Andre Benjamin struggling to hold our attention through them."
"This is maybe a little gloomy way to end it but, to me, the life of Evel Knievel contains the same seeds of self-doom as a Dostoevsky character's."
The film's political resonances are as mutable - and as muddled - as those of its predecessors.
Pascal's Lord is a petty villain who feels unworthy of Wonder Woman's attention - even when the fate of the world hangs in the balance.
"The Highwaymen takes the most exciting manhunt in American history, and somehow makes it boring."
"Fickman and the three screenwriters drag this inevitability out for close to two hours, with a tiresome back-and-forth of conflicts and reconciliations."
Extremely tacky and incredibly unimaginative!
"By the time the newlyweds end up in Venice (Italy, not California, though it was probably filmed there), the story's gone so flat that you may feel like a browbeaten spouse trapped in a loveless marriage."
"Alfre Woodard, along with Aldis Hodge, do their best to take ""Clemency"" across the finish line. Both are terrific, but they're ultimately done a disservice by the screenplay."
"It's incredible to look at, but once it steps away from pure cinematic storytelling, the latest round of tightly-corseted depressive desperation dissolves on impact."
40% of this movie is quite good - the other 60%...not so much...
Its stance toward every dipshit slasher and creature-horror flick that's come before it never feels less than casually hostile.
It all feels a bit like an uninspired take on Christopher Guest's genuinely hilarious Waiting for Guffman.
"Constrained by the plot of the novel, the film keeps the two lovers apart for quite a spell, robbing the project of the crazy-in-love energy that made Twilight, the first entry in the series, such a guilty pleasure."
"The story is a worthy one, but the film lacks any daring expressive touches that might have made it, at the very least, noteworthy."
The overall vibe here ends up being less “good dirty fun” than “foul-mouthed teenager trying to look cool.”
...this F-bomb and expletive filled thing...defies categorization. It's not a comedy because it's not funny. It's not a romance because it's not romantic...it's not a Christmas movie because it can't possibly be seen by children.
"As was the case with The Hurt Locker (2008), where the central figures were US soldiers in Iraq, Bigelow concentrates in her latest work on how exhausting and difficult it is to be a victimizer."
"This is a terrible movie. But it has the strange quality that it seems to have been made by people who were enjoying themselves. Not enough, unfortunately, for the rest of us to enjoy it too."
"A smudge on the writing record of William Monahan (The Departed), Mojave throws a Hollywood 'player' into the desert to meet the Devil with meandering and pointless results."
"[A] scattershot, lazy slice of agitprop, which recycles Moore's usual slice-and-dice job on corporations, while bobbing a curtsey to the current crisis."
"The film contains barely a fraction of the originality, drama, humor, horror or whatever else the original was selling. It's a shame, and a lot of people are going to be disappointed."
You won't believe how tiresome bad taste has become.
"Besides its dead-eyed cast, this 'animated' escapade is thrown off the tracks by pointless detours seemingly intended just to stretch the journey time."
"The Rhythm Section"" is a junk pile of missteps, from the convoluted screenplay that hops from locale to locale in Advil-inducing fashion to the overly stylized directing to the self-consciously ""cool"" oldies pop music selections."
"One long, extended chase sequence interspersed with awkward flirting."
This would have worked better as a short documentary.
It's the ultimate showdown between cliche and more cliche.
"For all its self-seriousness, ""Hotel Artemis"" is ultimately a silly story of bad guys, big egos and one good fight sequence."
"Heigl remains committed all the way to the ludicrous end, and her unhinged villainy is all the movie really has going for it."
"Barbed satire gives way to a pedestrian tale of teenage romance. The result is mildly entertaining, but not what's been promised"
It has all the excitement of eating oatmeal.
"Dante hasn't been able to hit his stride in awhile, and unfortunately his latest filmBurying the Exis a lazy and uninspired attempt to recapture the old magic."
"Game over, man."
Happily N'Ever After exists to reward anyone who's delighted in the destruction the Shrek franchise has waged against our fairy-tale memories.
Utiliza el gastado recurso argumental de que tanto el bueno como el malo se necesitan mutuamente para poder existir
Tawdry and shallow.
"Unfriended portends a revolution, but it's click-bait after all."
You're not dreaming... it's another mediocre horror movie about sleep paralysis.
"It's always hard not to think of classic Disney as the standard for a film like this. Using that yardstick, Crest Animation/Lionsgate's Alpha and Omega is far from an emotionally rich, fulfilling experience."
"A frail conceit that Allen fills out with humor that's surprisingly obvious and broad...a mildly diverting fantasy, executed without much style."
"When it goes wrong you get something like... well, you get something like Victor Frankenstein,/i>."
Why does it think it's serious drama when it's actually something closer to a parody of Charles Bronson movies?
Taken 3 isn't a bad time; it's often laughable without veering totally into self-parody.
"This new live action attempt at Jem and the Holograms only goes to prove that, sometimes, revisionism is just another way of ruining a viable property."
I am convinced that Dhont has a masterpiece in him. But there’s an immaturity to his movies that he must first overcome. He’s already so close.
"This Grudge is not good. I've seen it done worse, but I've also seen it done a lot better. It perfectly demonstrates that these spirits are terrifying enough to be kept alive on screen, but the writers are too afraid to write any new material."
This take on the man-boy Mowgli and his pack of jungle pals strides in technically bold new directions while also wading through narratively thin waters.
Quid Pro Quo hovers in a noir-shaded twilight zone where repressed memories and guilt merge in an obsession with physical and emotional paralysis.
The filmmakers play it safe&#44; which is exactly what anyone seeing this movie doesn&#8217;t want&#46;
"...a trying-way-too-hard piece of work that doesn't work on any real, palpable level..."
"One of Robin Williams's unspeaklably bad filler movies, and maybe one of his worst...and that's saying a lot."
Outrageous comedy isn't meant to be this safe.
Another one for Davy Jones' locker.
Disjointed parody.
"Rosamund Pike deserves better than this queasy exploitation pic, which plays as a belated dry run for ""Gone Girl."""
"If you're lost, you're not alone. The evidence suggests Soderbergh and his screenwriter were, too."
"At a time when cynical, pandering 'faith-based' movies have gained an extraordinary foothold at the box office, it should be exhilarating to see a genuinely provocative movie about the trials and tribulations of Jesus Christ. It isn't."
"The filmmakers clearly believe that their tangled storyline is madcap and delightful, but each new complication just serves to make us feel as though the blessed end of the movie is creeping further and further away."
"Earhart, a rebellious obsessive with an active distaste for societal convention, ends up feeling flat in practice."
"Kroc is a nasty piece of work, but the film's squeaky clean approach often makes him seem like an all-American hero."
"Lindbergh's biggest dilemma on the flight was trying to stay awake. To a large extent, it's ours, too."
"It is appreciated that it doesn't abuse of cheap scares, but it also doesn't make up for it with good horror scenes. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"The main joke here is that Connolly's Fido, though he never speaks, seems more alive than the rigidly conformist '50s males around him. It's not quite enough to keep Fido more than a slight comedy."
"While it is safe to say none of these movies was particularly worth making, I believe Part 5 is the one that brought the least for our collective edification."
"In the end, nothing can overcome the feeling of a dystopian déjà vu. If only a little imagination had been thrown in to stir things up."
"San Andreas is nowhere near the best movie made this year. Indeed, it might be one of the worst. But it is, without a doubt, one of the most unapologetic, self-aware, and entertaining romps of 2015. And that counts for something."
"[K]eeps running right up to moments that seem hellbent on, say, indulging homophobia... and then stopping short, neglecting to offer a punchline, and trying to distract us by moving in an entirely random different direction..."
Another incomprehensible trash explosion from the Guy Ritchie school of cinematic slugfests.
This movie is one big pulled punch. Dubya himself becomes a blank hole of neutrality and balance. Almost anyone else shown here would have made a more interesting subject for a biopic.
"Argh! No! After successful remakes with Halloween and even My Bloody Valentine, why would you reboot Friday the 13th with a non Jason-centric story? Fools!"
"The Book of Eli, yet another apocalyptic fantasy, suggests that Denzel Washington has become America's dullest actor."
"The problem is that it doesn't aim particularly high and, when the tears have dried and the cheers have subsided, there's a sense that what the movie offers is disappointingly ephemeral."
...the film quickly devolves into an interminable mess of hoary cliches and stale conventions (a trying-on-clothes montage? Really?)
It damn well works. Until Halle Berry hangs up.
"""My All American"" would have done better to dig deeper in its portrayal of a man who set such a high bar for the intrinsic character of a football player. Because he's actually the kind of example the sport could really use right now."
The latest failed attempt to build a cinematic franchise on the popularity of a superhero comic.
"""Ant-Man and the Wasp,"" the first sequel to 2015's ""Ant-Man,"" is barely an exoskeleton next to its much better predecessor."
"Boring adultery drama, but nice Ming-na nude scene."
There's much sprinting and keyboard-clacking for an audience that might feasibly value the sight of either over the presence of genuine invention or suspense.
"It's a frustrating sit, especially when great ideas for gender and behavioral examination are left to rot while Cinorre pays closer attention to her filmmaking interests, which often leaves the movie cold to the touch."
"Treading familiar territory with a heavy foot, the picture and its characters grow increasingly irritating as the family squabbles drone on."
The script is too easy. It uses broad strokes and lacks the subtlety that might have made the characters even more interesting.
Gets both a failing grade in physics and an equally abating review.
"The grave tone makes it stiff and leaden, the digi-saturated look is a turn-off. Damnable and disordered."
"Whilst the feature feels overall hollow, the small moments where it does find a voice come off as distasteful and simply annoying."
An early candidate for worst sequel of 2015 and also worst movie.
"What might have been a guilty-pleasure romp is hobbled by poor direction, sloppy pacing, and a story line that can't decide whether it's farce or a retread."
"Suffice to say that Blake Nelson doesn't have the visual gifts of his Minnesotan mentors, leaving us undistracted by surface flair and fully focused on his cartoonish characters and ragged, oddly callow script."
Viewers will probably find themselves wishing there was a sense of personality on screen to match the eccentric passion that clearly went into putting the project together.
Tonight better left to yesterday.
Not a pleasant way to spend an hour and 45 minutes.
"Writer-director John Ridley's time-travel romance underwhelms despite a promising premise, talented leads, and interesting source material."
The script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish.
"...could be read as the passion of Lisbeth Salander, as she undergoes a kind of secular crucifixion at the hands of the Swedish establishment ..."
As out of touch with reality as every other entry in the Lurie canon.
"I expect spectacular things from Spielberg, so when he delivers something that's just average, it's a bit of a letdown."
"You'll have to endure scattershot subplots, flat acting and brainless guy-speak banter if you want to hang with these Junkies."
The surface chills don't stick that well without a deeper story.
There's no heft to the material - only mindless violence - and Blake Lively is absolutely dreadful.
"Because Bay bombards you with so much, it's easy to forget that he can be a gifted technician."
"It's too often a routine '80s genre piece, straight down to the synthesizer score, over-lit night scenes, and bandana-sporting street punks."
"By refusing to go either full-on melodrama or pure sendup, they've sentenced the original show's characters to an eternity of being upstaged by ugly lampshades."
"All of the pieces function on their own but they never add up to anything great. Grant and Dunne are mismatched as a romantic pair, to be quite frank..."
On the whole Battle: Los Angeles is the emptiest form of sci-fi action: Just one bloody (or alien gooey) thing after another.
"On the one hand, it could seem like some kind of triumph to see a young black filmmaker play in the same shallow end of the pool, but given that she's already helmed two other (better!) features, this feels like the worst kind of regression."
Its seems as if the production has taken a bullet to the brain just like its heroine.
"Ed may be very well be the man who wasn't there, but that's not the only thing absent from this letdown of a motion picture."
"Hugely ""meh""."
"Regardless of its humour and sensitive moments, Thanks for Sharing fails to find a balance between a comedy and drama."
"It's a grand yarn, one that director Ron Howard shrinks into a too-tidy fairy tale complete with winking bookends and easy questions of morality."
"Once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy, the film becomes predictably conventional."
"Any film which opens with an implicit pelvic exam and closes with an explicit live birth is trying to say something, but the stuff in the middle, alas, doesn't amount to much of anything."
"Scripts this bad will sometimes seem fun with enough enthusiasm behind or in front of the camera, but the star power on display isn't enough to make this anything but a (hopefully) forgettable misstep for all involved."
"Michael Clayton literally knocks its brains out trying to be clever, but it ends up being the same kind of smart-alecky filmmaking most of Mr. Clooney's movies are famous for."
"There have been some successes in the last few years following Besson's formula of stale dialogue, light character and strong action. But there have been far more misses than hits. Colombiana doesn't even stand out among those."
"It looks good and is never dull, but there's something academic about the whole thing."
The Day the Earth Stood Still is a great study in all the things that can go wrong with a movie. The plot's all haywire and the casting's rotten and the dialogue's stupid and the camerawork's ugly and the CGI sucks.
"The most frightening thing about The Exorcism of Emily Rose is how three Oscar-nominated actors were talked into working with Scott Dietrickson, writer-director of the direct-to-video Hellraiser: Inferno."
It has potential that is not well used. [Full review in Spanish]
[A] fascinating but frustrating documentary ...
"For introducing children to the joys of classical music, the Warner Bros. Bugs Bunny cartoon shorts were far wittier and much less condescending."
"This imperfect family film adaptation is problematic from casting, characterizations, upsetting subject matter and editing technicalities."
"As an epic, it's monumentally slight."
...in its final section... the complexity of the situation spins no payoff and got me a bit frustrated.
"Bewitched is respectful of its origin, and it's brave enough to go beyond the obvious. Unfortunately, it goes beyond in a somewhat wrong direction. As a result, this broom stick doesn't really fly, it just glides along."
This isn&apos;t a serious movie&#44; despite Denzel Washington in full eruption and giving his calloused lines more weight and authority than they deserve&#46;
"Even if you overlook the lousy lighting, awkward editing, and uneven acting, there's so much talking -- and so little story -- that your mind is likely to wander."
"Same old Chan routine of 1-2-3 staging, only tweaked here with a distinct Hanna-Barbera tone that keeps Door safe for children, but less invigorating for Chan purists or, and God bless 'em, parents forced to accompany their kids to this thing."
An unremarkable thriller elevated by a few excellent performances and Paolo Virz's direction.
"A graduate of the High School Musical school of filmmaking (literally), Ortega is also the person responsible for many of the glaring problems here."
"Skimming the surface and romanticizing the reckless derring-do, it's infuriatingly ambiguous, just missing the mark."
"Despite what could have been a breakthrough performance for Walker, Blackbird becomes just a well-intentioned melodrama that lacks the focus it needs to truly soar."
"This movie is the worst. And the best. I haven't laughed like that in a theater in a long, long time, and not one of those laughs was earned on purpose."
"Reader, I did not laugh."
Kathryn Ferguson’s documentary Nothing Compares makes several mistakes in its noble mission to recover the mostly unhappy pop career of the Irish-born singer Sinéad O’Connor.
The only way Kidnap could possibly work is if the viewer isn't paying attention.
"The narrative is so programmed it is like watching software. Forrest Gump is a medley of sound bites-clever, cute, amusing, silly, sentimental-and irritatingly phony..."
"The first one was original, the second was still funny, but the third installment is on autopilot."
Every scene is as achingly long and laboured as the film's instantly forgettable title.
The contrivance factor is alive and well to the last frame.
"It's too long, the music isn't great, and I can't stand all the brightly colored twirling skirts."
All this star power and musical talent in the voice cast is great. It should have gone for more.
"With all of its technical virtuosity, The Revenant nevertheless has little soul. DiCaprio's performance is a tortured master class in method re-acting, but all of the prolonged suffering turns gratuitous."
"Plot is not the takeaway from Mimosas, which reminded me of Abbas Kiarostami's Taste of Cherry, another slow-winding ramble through the mountains."
"Once the kaleidoscopic spectacle ends, we're not left with much substance."
"Lacking any sort of urgency, suspense or passion, the film mystifies rather than thrills."
"Silly-minded and riddled with telegraphed convolution, Paranormal Activity 4's only legitimate scare tactic is its inevitable fifth sluggish serving waiting in the wings for a future flaccid presentation in a selected October month of your choosing."
Tom Hanks and the Coen brothers team up for a remake that's so much less than the sum of the parts.
"This would make for a pretty funny short film, but there's too much filler material here. Save this one for a rental if you're a Jack Black fan."
"The decision to tell Shakur's story from the artist's point of view may have been honorable in its way, but it's not the best artistic choice. Despite the soundtrack, the film feels flat."
Manages to be even dumber than the original.
"Van Sant has cranked up the realism about 20 points, but somehow what he achieves for the effort is a larger sense of banality!"
Wolff gives the material his all. If only his efforts could compensate for the film's gradual descent into banality.
"Well-made and proudly weird, this collection of fairy tales is missing something; it could have been funny, sexy, or thrilling, but instead it's clinical, like spying on bugs under a microscope."
Neither character comes off too well.
"While it remains mildly entertaining throughout, Welcome to the Punch lacks the snap, crackle, and pop of other contemporary examples of the genre"
Lone Survivor&#8217;s major saving grace is that it never resorts to actual flag-waving&#44; but enough pro-military overtones subsist in the material to consider it an effective recruiting video&#46;
...a misguided (and rather misbegotten) adaptation of Brett's superior book.
"It makes you want to see Murphy team up with Judd Apatow, or even take on a dead-serious dramatic role - do anything but star in another movie like this one."
"It's definitely creepy, and often very yucky, but it's far too pretentious to be scary."
"As handsome and as literary as Jim Jarmusch's agonizingly slow film is, its assets carry it only so far."
"Like childbirth, (it's) very messy and painful at times. But like raising children, there will be a few tears and a few laughs and somehow you'll get through it."
"The artwork is good, but so what? A story is what sells the picture, and here it most certainly doesn't."
"Contrived, heavy-handed and underwhelming in spite of its charismatic cast. The filmmakers try too hard to please the audience without trusting their intelligence nor their emotions enough."
"When filmmakers re-imagine history, as they did with Becoming Jane and now with The Other Boleyn Girl, affairs of the heart can get dicey. At least Jane Austen kept her head in the process."
... little more than an excuse to present a bunch of slice and dice battle scenes filmed with murky cinematography and a notable absence of emotional resonance.
This just isn't very funny. There are not enough laughs. 
"Some people's stories are so interesting that a book or a movie adaptation alone simply won't suffice. Sometimes both are needed. Apparently, Rupert Isaacson's is one of them."
"Clichd, contrived and needlessly convoluted, The Nut Job is a real chore."
"Righteous Kill was helmed by Jon Avnet (the excruciatingly bad 88 Minutes) with the sort of phony, frantic energy that suggests a director with little faith in his material."
A shockingly banal script lends the movie a generic awfulness; you wish Zellweger were in better hands.
The Dukes of Hazzard does such a textbook job of pandering to Bubba Q. Public that it ought to run for political office.
A film with a truly fascinating and clever premise that nevertheless collapses under the weight of everything that surrounds the central storyline.
"Warm Bodies pulls a nifty trick in the red-hot zombie genre: It lacks a brain, though it eats plenty of them."
"While Costner does his part, ultimately ""Brooks"" fails -- with a convoluted plot that seems more preposterous the more you think about it."
It was like being trapped in an episode of Poldark. I kept half-hoping Demelza would drift in with one of her kidney pies and give us all a break.
A nearly laugh-free comedy!
"""Evil Eye"" is the reincarnation of cheesy horror movies with no backbone."
"The movie goes barreling full-speed ahead in the wrong direction, as if the umpteenth film about a potential presidential assassination could possibly compare to, say, any given episode of 24."
"This is a flavourless, unsatisfying film."
"t's not what you'd call enterainment, although it has some really good performances and is morally instructive."
"Though there are several truly funny moments in Big Daddy, they're all included in the trailer, so if you've seen it, that's all you need."
"A lot of skilled professionals have been hired to do a professional job, and they have, but at no point does it feel alive or give anyone reason to spend time on it."
Very violent movie ultimately just falls apart.
"Despite the addition of dark fun and much-needed action, the over-the-top carnage unfortunately intensifies the feature's lack of depth and balance."
"There are several pieces of vulgar language in the film that some viewers might find objectionable. I found them neither objectionable nor particularly funny. In fact, that sums up how I felt about the entire film."
"Yes, from adults through teens to tykes, there's something here for everyone to dislike -- the whole clan can have fun making fun of this thing."
The Parineeti Chopra film has the subtlety of Shatabadi Express...
"Unexpected, a disappointing what-to-expect-when-you're-expecting comedy, tackles thorny issues of class and racial inequality with undue mildness."
"Stylistically dull, Crime After Crime proceeds from one talking-head interview to the next, sticking to sentiment."
"While Leong's examination of the human trafficking landscape is captivating, the film falters when it swims in the overly crowded pool of gangster films."
"As a tortured soul for whom beauty is power, Charlize Theron pulls out all the stops, but director Rupert Sanders doesn't know when to rein her in and some of her scenes tip over into ranting."
"""The Vast of Night"" works best as a hint at what Patterson will one day be able to accomplish behind the camera."
One tires of the movie's relentlessly shrill tone and its excessively raunchy jokes.
"Achieves the level of a soapy TV miniseries, and while the acting is for the most part awful, you can pass the time studying the wardrobe and hairstyles."
See the movie if you like emotional car wrecks and people who can't hold their mud.
"It's a turgid, seemingly endless trudge through Gallic angst and ennui without one memorable performance, image, line of dialogue or note of music."
"The eye is given plenty to enjoy, but the heart goes wanting."
"Nasty, repellent and dull...a sleazy, sensationalistic but curiously boring kidnap tale that wastes the talents of its starry cast."
"Women are necessary in The American, like the Italian landscapes and winding stone stairways."
A time-travel comedy that doesn't go anywhere we haven't been before.
The desperately unfunny kidnapping farce King's Ransom is the cinematic equivalent of trampled chewing gum on a subway platform.
"It's numbing to watch the moderate imagination that comes with placing a big man among a shrunken society fade away in favor of gross-out gags, pop-culture references and a sing-along finale more groan-inducing than most."
The film's litany of bad ideas overshadows any of its thematic concerns.
Here's the bottom line: Denis Cooverman might love Beth Cooper. But I don't.
"Take all the worst aspects of  Stranger Things, amplify them, and you still wouldn't have a movie as unrelenting terrible as Summer of '84."
"... derivative of Short Circuit while generally lacking charm, surprise, or imagination."
"Mr. Boorman takes these myths very seriously, but he has used them with a pretentiousness that obscures his vision."
"Cosby mugs away for all he's worth, but good gags are few and far between."
Gloomy and lugubrious...another expensive dud.
"Light entertainment that should prove a popular choice for a girls' night out, although it's too long and most of the characters are irritating,"""
Blame Lions Gate for neither sending this direct to cable or treating it as the art house movie it is. Instead... they have ensured the film's failure.
Competes only with Prince Caspian for having the most inert action sequences of the summer.
"A drama by Ozon with noble intentions, far from cheap sentimentality, but it gives me the feeling that in his story of terminal illness there is a superficial indulgence that prevents it from being intimate. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The cast gives it their all, but this tepid dramedy lacks fervour and originality."
A supernatural spell of boringness smothers it all.
The movie is a glossy wreck.
The latest installment of the Magic Mike Cinematic Universe replaces its rollicking debauchery and subtle critique of capitalism with basic gender theory and vague eroticism.
"The characters are secondary to the CGI dinosaurs, which is the root of Jurassic's problem. But if you enjoyed the CGI'ed wasteland of Godzilla and Planet of the Apes, Jurassic World will not disappoint."
An embarrassingly murky mess that takes something that could've been made into agreeably cheeseball fun and sucks all the fun out of it.
"Image so much subverts intention that Jeff Goldblum's tragic flyperson finally seems more ludicrous than affecting, voyeuristically bizarre."
"As a longtime comic-book fan and Spidey enthusiast, how can I be so blasé about his latest big-screen incarnation?"
"The whole film's full of offhandedly racist portrayals anyway; if LeBeouf is co-opting the culture just to be lazily and disparagingly stereotyped in unity with his co-stars, then that seems like the least of anyone's problems."
"It is a craftsman-like piece of filmmaking with a suitably flaky performance by Perkins, but it isn't really a sequel to Psycho. It continues the story, but not the spell."
"... sub-grindhouse material blown out of proportion by its creator's ego. For the first time, the complaints of others are clearer; the excesses, the nasty streak.... you realize a previously essential filmmaker won't always be that."
Full of plot contrivances&#44; unconvincing dialogue&#44; and shaky performances&#46;
I got to say I was having a hard time keeping my attention up... This is definitely only for [Apichatpong Weerasethakul] completists. 
The movie is so routine that you welcome offbeat things like an alien who makes incredibly high-pitched noises. It's the sort of thing that might jolt you out of your sleep.
Great Figure filmmaking that acts more as monument than living history.
All the tension and scariness of the original has gone and in its place is a bit of floppy old cabbage. See the Fifties version if you can.
Here is an aggressively mediocre action thriller&#44; which does precisely nothing interesting with its barely existent premise&#46;&#10;
An exhaustingly jumbled mess.
"Poor Crystal. There remains a scintilla of dignity in his sad clown. He may beatbox while wearing wraparound sunglasses, but, thankfully for you and yours, he does not dance the robot."
"Outlaw King plays out like a filler episode of Game of Thrones, between its Battle of the Bastards-like treatment of medieval combat and cribbing half its cast."
With a COVID-19 pandemic theme&#44; the horror flick Fear is an idiotic time waster with a muddled story&#44; tacky visual effects&#44; and weak ideas that are ripoffs of better-made horror films&#46; Avoid this boring junk&#46;
"Clearly inspired by the work of Terrence Malick, Director Renji Philip's ""The Wake of Light"" is little more than a highlight reel for some truly stunning cinematography."
"The film version feels most energized when it's amping up to sell toys: fetishizing the clicking of plastic into plastic, and supersizing the characters' armor and vehicles with a deranged zeal matched only by real police departments around the country."
"Again and again, the I Love Trouble script takes us deeper and deeper into the machinations of a high-tech company when what we want to see is Nolte and Roberts outfox each other."
It's self-referential and self-rewarding to the point that it has virtually no other content.
mother! Or - what not to expect when you're expecting.
Zoolander No. 2 is a cameo-filled shadow of the first movie.
"When Law leaves in the middle, the whole film just sags."
"As a film that sets out to poke fun at the LA, St Tropez tan, famous for being famous, stupid small dogs lifestyle, its far too candy-coated and lacks bite, while the comic timing is off."
It might have been a better idea for the makers of No One Knows About Persian Cats to make a straightforward documentary.
"This unfunny comedy, a loose remake of a 1960s British romp, can't decide whether Billy Bob Thonrton's ""teacher"" is a hero or villain and thus every scene negates the previous one in tone and morale until the movie literally self-destructs at the end"
"Instead of demythologizing Salinger, Rebel in the Rye plays like a fan film rather than an honest examination of a complex figure."
"“The Visitor” isn’t a terrible movie, just a tired one."
An uneven effort ...
The dog is an absolute charmer -- would that the movie had spent its time on his adventures in the woods than on the dullards who ultimately seem incapable of finding a book in a library.
"...his most political film to date, yet any commentary Solondz tries to make becomes muddled amid all the depressing weirdness."
"As for Gary Cole's menacing bossman, he's a hemp-ty suit, a walking life lesson that, um, 'People who live in grass houses should not throw stoners.'"
"The performances carry it to a point, but then you realize that Youth isn't saying anything new, nor is it saying anything old in a fresh way."
"The misleading trailer suggests 'Nancy Drew vs. the Thing,' but this graphic-novel adaptation is more 'CSI: Antractica' -- a straight if occasionally gruesome murder mystery, boosted by the novelty of its sub-zero South Pole setting."
"Sadly, License to Wed lived up to my expectations 100%. That is to say, it was unfunny and uninspired."
La carrera de Reitman ha entrado en un estado de involucin del que no se ve una pronta recuperacin.
"In Cairo Time, Juliette means to care, but she seems rather unfit for it."
"As the monsters are set free, and special effects mayhem starts to pile up, Goosebumps becomes an undifferentiated thrill ride, a slightly exhausting roll call that includes deadly garden gnomes, a teen werewolf, a giant mantis and a lot of slime."
"One would be hard-pressed to describe this, despite the wealth of beauty on display, as anything but an ugly film, shot and cut ineptly."
"This feature might work better as a television series, but Garcia himself gives the picture some much-needed ballast."
"A big yawn, bereft of drama, surprise or any discernible point."
"I love Sanaa Lathan, except when she has to play dumb. And, boy, does The Perfect Guy need her to be dumb."
"A misguided project from Holland: Watching Verlaine and Rimbeau engage in endless arguments about the nature of love, you wonder when they had time to create the poetry that revolutionized the world."
If there has ever been a film that showcases the hypocrisy of the Motion Picture Association of America more than Sylvester Stallone's Rambo I'm pretty positive I've never seen it.
An ultra-conservative and criminally dull exercise in selective revisionist history.
"This one's a Spike-for-hire affair, a case of a flashy director juicing up a first-time screenwriter's efforts."
"Kaling and Thompson's clash of the earnest cub and lioness in winter sustains the film's core, but this subgenre of the romcom argues that work is life. You can't get the work wrong."
"However, the film brushes over certain elements of the book (most notably Gabriel's relationship with his partner) and shies away from its more important themes (AIDS, child abuse etc), leaving the equivalent of a sanitised TV version of the book."
"An over cooked ham of a film, overstuffed with vampish performances and a narrative far too convoluted for its own good"
Gone are Ritchie's style and wit. Gone is the mischievous sense of fun that pervaded his other films. Here instead are drudgery and inanity.
[Rose] isn't enough of a draw to make the formula worth recycling.
These dilemmas are underdone when they needed to be detailed. There could have been great moments...
Despite the huge and well-deserving success of Steven Spielberg&apos;s triple Oscar-winning original a full 30 summers ago&#44; &apos;Jurassic Park&apos; has been slowly melting in the dark ever since&#46; Maybe this alleged &apos;epic conclusion&apos; finally will put a lid on it&#46; 
"There are some inventive moments along the way, but these are interspersed with lots of posturing, yelling and brawling."
"""What's Your Number?"" sticks to the low common denominators of most Hollywood romances, and it ends up a commonplace one for doing so."
"This was a valiant attempt to cast fresh light, with less obvious interviewees and material... Otherwise, this was largely standard Diana-fare, chiefly striking for how certain key moments have aged."
"It's all kinds of unnecessarily weird and tasteless and exploitative and way, way, way too blunt and shrill."
"Pointedly and joylessly explaining everything turns out to be this movie's favourite thing, I guess because aliens tend to struggle with our human emotions."
"Don't Look Up is an aggressive, unfunny misfire from a filmmaker who used to have the patent on feature-length humor."
"It’s steamy to be sure, and Armas carries it off with brazen bravado, but the film works only in wisps. "
Whatever intrigue is generated by the pairing of Brosnan and Moore swiftly dissipates due to a cliche-ridden script.
The sense that we're watching events occur outside a real time or place distances us from them. The film's main achievement is in visual design.
The interior lives of Heroes' adults seem like wild guesses.
"...a missed opportunity that's rarely, if ever, as much fun as its title might've indicated."
Deep Water is the worst film I've seen in a long time. The story never progresses and you keep waiting for the climax that never happens. The character's actions are never explained or given much depth.
"Merkins gets by on its considerable wit and a few genuinely hilarious moments for the first hour, then tries to play catch-up in the final 30 minutes by attempting to capitalize on marginal subplots."
Fury of the Gods pits a family of six young heroes against a mythic sisterhood of three villains&#8212;something was going to fall through the cracks&#46; You just wish it wasn&#8217;t everything that made the first movie watchable&#46;
"I know it's pointless to review the film they didn't make. But underneath this clangy, pounding, speedy, thin, energetic confetti-shower of a movie is a collection of missed opportunities begging to be noticed."
It isn't ruthless enough to achieve the level of savagery that would make it really offensive -- and truly memorable.
"Williams works hard at seeming to be a kid inside an adult body, and some of his inspirations work well. But he has been ill-served by a screenplay that isn't curious about what his life would really be like."
Even a mangled bit of Whedonese about a toad struck by lightning could benefit a superhero story this starved for character.
[An] airless saga of university toffs building themselves up to run for God and country at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris...
"Though it's claiming to be a comedy, the Ice Cube/Kevin Hart team-up Ride Along isn't actually funny. At all."
"Where Chloe could have catharsis, instead we get stasis - but it's a pretty limbo, populated by characters you hope eventually will figure it out."
Koepp's screenplay isn't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own.
"Underdog as a film is not totally worthless. It's a winner with kids, as is anything with a talking dog."
Director Eli Roth's penchant for torture-porn violence tends to generate unintended sympathy for the villains who get what's coming.
"While everything here is mostly unspoken, and the film itself hints at a broader set of concerns than simply two lost souls meeting on foreign ground, Here too often feels like a jumble of ideas that don't quite cohere."
"Curtis drags the story through all the routine period motions, where everybody looks and talks and dresses like they're in a stately prestige film."
"Disappointmentstruck and even rather boredomstruck are reasonable descriptions of my emotional state, having sat through this contrived, self-conscious and twee YA fantasy from director Todd Haynes."
The remake neither pays perceptive tribute to the original nor updates it in anything but hackneyed form.
The only surprise is that heavyweights Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis agreed to produce this; I assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies' underwear.
"Add to the long-winded title of this film, ""...and completely unnecessary."""
Too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise.
This was a terrible movie.
A dull adventure tale about macho men who fight oil fires.
Memo to the studio honcho holding remake rights to Easy Rider: Don't take any calls from Mark Wahlberg.
"The movie is lost. Whishaw succeeds in making the repulsive protagonist thoroughly repulsive, which is probably a testimony to his acting ability. But it doesn't make it anything worth watching."
[The] ostensible archival footage proves so clunky and transparently phony that the entire gimmick collapses.
"Branagh's retelling of the classic Agatha Christie tale is visually sumptuous yet otherwise inert, a series of what are essentially cameos by performers far too gifted to waste their time like this."
A gruesome but uninspired environmental-disaster thriller that's an unconvincing example of the overexposed faux-found-footage horror subgenre.
"There's something here for enthusiasts to enjoy, but to newcomers or those lacking an appreciation for Romero's work, Survival of the Dead is a zombie soap opera."
Morally dubious and ultimately suspense-less
Rarely have I felt more like my life was slipping away in the cinema.
This movie made me want to gnaw my own eyes out.
A noisy time-waster that could have used some outside the box thinking to make its shop-worn story more effective.
"While you are bathing in all the beauty, you are waiting and waiting and waiting for this film to say something, yet when it finally does... it all just feels empty somehow."
"Weekend at Bernie's is a suffocating, repeating, offensive funeral  [Full review in Spanish].

"Owen Wilson - the poor man's Woody Harrelson - stars... Because Wilson doesn't seem to care, it's hard for viewers to feel much differently."
"While I appreciate what Bong is saying regarding social awareness, there was something that bothered me and frankly left me shaken and in tears, and that was how humans themselves and in particular the character of K (Steven Yeun) are treated in the film."
"Poor Woody Harrelson. Here he is with a great role in 'Rampart,' and the movie turns out to be about as messy as one can get, through no fault of his own."
"Let the projectionist raise the audio above a whisper, and your enjoyment of the free-flowing spectacle will be diluted by some of the worst acting and writing known to mainstream film -- and that's by George Lucas' meager standards."
"Choppy, disjointed, and overlong!"
Didn't need to be a movie.
"Algumas piadas so muito boas, mas, de modo geral, o filme decepciona. Caso se mantivesse politicamente incorreto, seria melhor."
"To borrow from TV terminology, the series hasn't jumped the shark yet, but the strain of inventing bizarre deaths is beginning to show."
Tedious and unfunny virtually from start to finish...
"Blizzards, tornados and floods--oh, my!...Just a brainless orgy of special effects periodically interrupted by sappy human-interest episodes."
"That famed ""blue steel"" look may be lethal, but the lack of anything funny here is far deadlier for those hoping for a good time."
&#8220;Bardo&#8221; doesn&#8217;t exactly invite audience investment&#44; largely remaining cold to the touch as the endeavor pursues any and all moviemaking impulses without supplying dramatic support&#46;
I really liked the first one. This one...not so much.
...and your movie is a joke.
"Unfortunately, for all Benjamin's fine work All is By My Side is one long string of such cliches and counts as a major disappointment."
"Lethal for kids and an unspeakable insult to adults, this unreleasable fiasco is a torture for all."
It tries to satisfy too many different groups at once and ends up watering down the art so much it satisfies no one.
"A relentless misfire, ineptly stealing from a number of crude but more ably executed comedies."
"A self-indulgent, self-aware, and smug piece of crap and possibly one of the worst of 2007..."
"In pitching for the mass market, Boyle's film has allowed itself to be rebranded as a Hollywood star vehicle, a cynical assemblage that is never more than the sum of its market-researched parts."
"A tough, dated sit-thru. At least much of the music still sings."
"Carrey delivers a disappointing performance, the sort of calculated turn we had come to routinely expect from Robin Williams until his recent dramatic awakening."
"There's a solid woman- finding-herself story somewhere in here, but you'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it."
"Berge's seemingly serene lack of complicated emotions seems the opposite of what the title of L'amour fou means, which is an obsessive passion."
The result feels less like a creative reimagining of a classic for a new generation and more like your mom threw you a Rocky-themed birthday party.
The tone is all over the place.
Junk
"[The cast and crew] are all victims of a script of such colossal banality and gross stupidity that smiles freeze on their faces, leaving them looking trapped and desperate, much like the audience."
The first major release of the year is a complete dud. Shocker!
"With few exceptions, however-like a particularly awkward moment between Maura and the guy she's trying to woo (Ike Barinholtz)-the scenes generally feel like punch lines in search of something to hold them all together."
Ghost Stories feels like something famous people have done as favours for one another.

"The director, Bryan Singer, works more anonymously here than he did in the X-Men films. Jack the Giant Slayer feels like it could have been made by anyone."
"Not a single one of Mayday's ideas is novel or bold, and it instead presents revolutionary possibilities as nothing more than a daydream."
The only thing more notable than Maladies's pretentiousness is how harmless that pretentiousness feels.
"Somewhere under the layers of pretentiousness and in-jokes and cleverness and reflexivity and artsiness and talk, there is probably a film lurking. I didn't find it."

Treats a series of complicated artistic decisions like the season finale of Dancing With the Stars.
"By the time Jeremy Garelick's movie gets to the altar, it does hit a groove. But by then, the humor feels like stale champagne."
The Outsider is a first film and it comes with all the problems of a novice effort. It needs a firmer hand in the editing room and misses much of the point about what makes Toback so much an outsider in the Hollywood system.
"Nicole Kidman could hardly be more enchanting in the lead, but the script is one of writer-director Nora Ephron's weakest, the laughs are scattered and we leave the movie feeling it sure could have been better."
The second half of the story plays like a bland re-telling of the first.
Can we please declare a moratorium on Scream rip-offs?
The Chadwick Boseman&#47;T&#8217;Challa tributes are memorable and beautifully crafted&#44; but &#8216;Wakanda Forever&#8217; is cluttered&#44; slow&#44; and largely conversational &#40;during the first two acts&#41;&#44; as the story attempts to maneuver around its star&#8217;s passing&#46;
"It's not exactly riveting material, and even Jim Jarmusch - the veteran writer-director who traffics in the day-to-day contemplation of human existence - struggles to make ""Paterson"" pop."
"About as subtle as an FTD bouquet in its look, theatrical style, story structure, and greeting card message of uplift."
A beautifully observed film that never arrives at its desired emotional destination.
This noir take on George Reeves' death has its high points but doesn't quite fly.
"In the light of day, it's the kind of movie you'd go Coyote Ugly on in order to get away from."
"The problem for The Intervention lies in its misjudgment of tone. It's played for feelgood laughs (the cornball ending feels especially unearned), when DuVall should have instead dug deeper to exploit her characters for the messed up people that they are."
"The musical numbers offer some of the strongest moments in ""Country Strong."" The story's offstage dramas, however, are like a country song with every other verse removed."
"Far too reverent to the source material, po-faced, literal and without raising much intensity."
This latest version isn't likely to reinvigorate an interest in Burnett's previous adaptations or her prose with what amounts to a pileup of tedious approximations and clichés of her characters and themes.
"While the violence is horrifying, the encasing narrative is perversely ""heroic"", with corn-fed dialogue presented as solidly non-ironic, and images of the real-life combatants used to stirring, manipulative ends."
"Theron looks terrific and the cast do the best they can with the material they're given, but someone really should have written Aeon a snappy comeback or two."
The movie's biggest issue blooms from its core: it doesn't seem to know what kind of movie it wants to be.
The Bounty Hunter marks a new low and a new genre: the bail-bondage rom-com.
"Grassroots disingenuously has it both ways, reducing politics first to a David-versus-Goliath adventure, and then to an everyone-is-cool bowl of mush."
"Green, we're told at some point in ""Green Lantern,'' is the color of will. Based on the movie surrounding that line, it's also the color of won't. Won't make sense. Won't satisfy a soul. Possibly won't make a dime."
It's not much of a movie - more a parade of rah-rah triumphs obscuring a batch of logical oddities - which makes Washington's committed performance stand out like the heavenly host in the night sky over Bethlehem.
"This debacle of a film shows an strangely immature side of genre cinema, a forced task that has no meaning or purpose. [Full review in Spanish]."
Ugly is in the Eye of the Beholder.

"Riley eventually somewhat grows into his role, but Hedlund grabs us and never lets go."

"These days, even employing the traditional, 2-D cel style of animation seems like a quaint notion."

If only the story line and setting were equal to the more compelling bits of character interplay.
"Thomas Haden Church wears a puzzled scowl throughout this bizarre film noir, and so will viewers as they struggle to figure out just what Jake Goldberger is going for."
"By thrusting the story about women who pass themselves off as men in nineteenth-century England into close-up, this film version accentuates its implausibility to fatal effect."

"Never Let Me Go would drift from memory if it weren't for Mulligan's face of loss, hope, and aggrieved empathy -- a look that's hard to let go."
"Stick with your memories of Rocky Balboa and Jake La Motta, because ""Grudge Match"" isn't a fight worth fighting."
"In this movie, all displays of passion feel like gaudy pantomime."
"... an impressive technical achievement dragged down by a script that doesn't achieve the intended emotional resonance, either for its characters or for its topical but heavy-handed political message."
Standard slasher fare with attempts at being a whodunit.
"Fuqua's made two clean piles separating good and evil, and in doing so, he's thrown away the film's point."
"Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films."
Guns get drawn. Bullets fly. Blood spills. You've seen it all before.
"It's beyond incompetent, and it probably also sounds like it's a hoot and a holler as a result. This is not the case."
"An addictive documentary that'll have you cheering and crying, then waiting for the director to jump out from behind your sofa and say it was all a big joke."
The movie never fully clicks.
"Just as dispiriting as these cheesy platitudes is the fact that, beat by beat, the film follows the same trajectory as virtually every other movie ever made about a musician..."
"At one point, this was titled Mercury Falling, and that is a far more apt name for this ice cold thriller."
"The hype for Cuarón's ambitious Gravity has been . . . well . . . out of this world. Critics have fallen over themselves praising the film and I went into the theater expecting very big things indeed. I hate to say this, but I didn't love it."
"The deepening ties between Anna and Adrien have the same kind of dull, matte gloss of the black-and-white cinematography - monochrome that occasionally segues to color, an ill-conceived gambit occasioned by flashbacks and fleeting moments of joy."
"This is one of those fit-for-framing productions that screams, 'Look at me! Look at me! Don't bother with what's beneath the surface.'"
The film stumbles to its conclusion - it never gives its audience enough credit.
The best thing about Mars Attacks! is that you'll come away believing you could have done the movie better.
"There's too much of an ""Are we all at fault for Amy's death?"" argument being posed that doesn't hold up."
"What begins as a seemingly brainless, bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche-drenched melodrama by mid-film and, by film's end, a feminist action fantasy."
"For a film about a killing machine who can see at night, it's fittingly ironic that the film itself is, both narratively and visually, a dark, muddled mess."
"In the end, the moralism of ""Arbitrage"" feels glued-on rather than earned."
"The whole tone of this glib black comedy, with its cartoon bad guys and conspiratorial wink with each addition to the body count, seems rather dated."
"Salient quote: 'Right now, my mind is running on empty.' Yeah, it's going around."
"Unfortunately, El Cantante turns out to be much more of an Anthony and Lopez project than a Lavoe one. Shot with seeming disregard for any of his actual artistic importance, the film fails to answer some of the simplest and most important questions about"
"I'm just so sick of this. This grim, joyless, faux-realist medieval world &#8230; movies in this King Arthur / Kingdom of Heaven mold that seem almost entirely lacking in sympathy and affection for their hero's world."
This is one Pixar film where you really do feel the length as keenly as the merchandising push.
"Ultimately, Angry Indian Goddesses is a decent watch as long as the fun lasts but tumbles downhill with gathering pace as the 'anger' kicks in."
The moment in any family film when dignity goes out the window is an animal reaction shot.
"The premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in, but the film must have been written ... in the thrall of a vicious hangover."
"The last thing the world needed was yet another quirky coming-of-age film, especially one as dull and disjointed as Terri."
"It means well and is well-cast, but director Julie Taymor's overly long and very granular look at the life of activist/journalist Gloria Steinem is muddled and off-point."
For those who like their sci-fi to have the depth and breadth of comic books.
"I kept thinking of Donald Duck's nephews: For all its noble intentions, ""The Aftermath"" is dewey, gooey and, even with its moments, hooey."
"Ultimately ... two points of emphasis must be pared down to one, and this is where ""Kill Your Darlings,"" arriving at the fork in the road, makes the wrong turn."
"Director Jesse Moss tries hard to offer a portrait of Pete Buttigieg that's more intimate and earnest than the persona he projected during his abortive 2020 presidential campaign, but it's impossible to show something that doesn't exist."
"When Shyamalan spills all, we realize this isn't worth the time it takes to play out. If this is a reminder to make the most of every day, it easily could have been delivered back at the hotel pool. With a drink."
The big problem here is director Gore Verbinski. It is almost as if his massive success on the first two has given him personal license to indulge in every single whim and idiosyncrasy the filmmaker could ever imagine.
"Although the initial scenes are intriguing and the design of the creature is suitably revolting, the film begins to grind to a halt soon after the egg hatches as Hanna Bergholm presents a story that is a little too familiar for its own good."
"For a movie that claims up front to be based ""on an absurd but true story,"" Stockholm sure could use some absurdity coursing through its veins."
"Whatever the initial motivation, Def's performance runs dangerously close to nudging our sympathies toward the bad guys."
"Without compelling characters, worthwhile performances, or superficially arresting aesthetic pleasures, the only thing of interest in ""Out of the Dark"" is its thematic concern with suppressed third-world citizens."
The gritty film is a no-holds-barred bare-knuckle battle royal through the most impoverished corner of contemporary America. It is not for the faint of heart.
"Charlie’s Angels falls into the grey area of not good, but also not bad."
A pre-teen has a homosexual retarded 41 year-old friend and a sexually inappropriate mother. Is this Duchovny's psycho-sexual autobiography?
"It's a shame because the myth at the heart of this story has such a rich history to it, and the film is bookended by scenes that render Fei Fei's Chinese family with great warmth and exquisite detail."
You might end up feeling like you've aged more than the time that's passed while sitting through this initially intriguing but ultimately redundant offering.
"Nicolas Cage has worn a lot of things on his head over the years, but the Burmese fisherman's bonnet we glimpse at the beginning of the action-adventure romp Jiu Jitsu is something new. It's one of the few things in the movie that is."
The film runs just over an hour and a half but feels at least twice that long.
"Polarising by default, and pretty sussed about how to get a rise out of the most jaded viewers, this two-bit Tarantino knock-off is not without its guilty-pleasure merits if you're in the right mood."
"Cody's labored quips fall flat coming from these actors and in this context, and her script is maddeningly short on suspense or excitement."
"A well-acted amalgam of four compelling stories, but it's ultimately too undercooked and underwhelming."
... more of the same without the nostalgia component. [Full review in Spanish]
"For a film that seemingly indicates later life epiphanies and growth, this slow going narrative offers nothing new."
Just because I'm not a fan of Nicholas Sparks isn't going to stop me from recommending The Last Song to its target audience.
Courteney Cox Owes The World An Apology For Her Directorial Debut Just Before I Go
"Slick direction and a strong central turn from Jeffrey Dean Morgan will keep you watching, if rarely from the edge of your seat."
"For a movie that so desperately wishes to be Tolkienesque, it's a questionable choice to burden it with both the Snow White moniker and Kristen Stewart."
A messy&#44; bloated epic about Hollywood&#8217;s early years&#44; Babylon is more interested in shattering movie magic mythos than indulging in any&#46; It spends the bulk of its time on behind-the-scenes grime&#8212;and rubbing our noses in it&#46;
"Pray that Peter Jackson doesn't tackle the ""Foundation"" series next."
"The Last Airbender is not just a flop, it's a big-budget flop, and it's a throwback to that grand old genre, the movie that's so bad that it's bad."
"With a narrative as flat and barren as the red martian landscape, John Carter is a big-budget sci-fi spectacle that fails to excite or entertain."
"Three Thousand Years of Longing actually ends on a creative high note, but the path to that conclusion is filled with muddled adventures that play like something out of a 1980s B-movie. We find ourselves longing for the credits to roll."
"Jason Statham, Clive Owen, and Robert De Niro are the stars, and the movie feels like a vanilla-flavored smoothie of their previous efforts."
"Rupert Grint earns a few chuckles throughout, as do a handful of the supporting players, but ultimately Moonwalkers feels a whole lot like a funny idea that never got fleshed out beyond its second act."
Jean-Luc Lagarce's 1990 stage play about a young playwright who returns home after a 12-year absence to tell his family he's dying becomes a suffocating experience in writer/director Dolan's hands.
"One of those frothy films photographed in the quaint English countryside that yearns to be a word-of-mouth hit, but is too thin and predictable when it should be rich in nuance and off-kilter."
"Finding the right balance among tones and subtexts can be tricky. In this case, despite some flourishes, the film lacks a deeper resonance."
"True History of the Kelly Gang needed some limitations to create a bit more clarity. The dreary mood of the film is set early on, and it never finds its way to any excitement or suspense."
"Strident, bombastic parable."
"Look, if you were as bloated as The Hobbit trilogy, you'd probably be showing signs of exhaustion toward the end of a nearly nine-hour runtime, too."
A solid B movie with old-school comedy reminiscent of Mel Brooks. Parker and Cage give standard play. It's James Caan that gives the film its spark. He's marvelous.
"We keep thinking, hoping, and praying that Bride will aim higher, but it never happens"
"Aside from the PBS-re-enactment music, the film's primary problem is that it lacks a clear central plot."
"An unfunny romantic comedy with few sparks and fewer jokes, barely suitable for 7 p.m. TV."
A trio of paper-thin plots spun into a cutesy shard of stale ribbon candy.
"Having its wedding cake and eating it too, this malevolent catfight catastrophe in chick flick lite clothing, satirizes that nuptial consumer orgy, while gorging on the excesses of matrimonial materialism."
"Wise's return to the 'street-sussed musical' is painfully disappointing: a parade of frantic, vacuous gestures which, like combat dancing itself, simply never delivers the punch..."
"It looks great but, really, could hardly be sillier."
Inadequate emotionally and psychologically.
"The attempt to create a 'serious' anti-misogyny message through this shallow, improbable material -- directed and written by two men, with no complex female characters onscreen -- is maybe the worst part of it."
"Eschewing more sophisticated and higher-degree-of-difficulty moodiness for lots of panicked thrashing about, this found-footage horror tale is an exercise in well-intentioned tedium."
"It's Titanic meets Gladiator but not as good as either. If you don't have time to read the rest of the review, that should do you just fine."
None of the millions of dollars in cutting-edge animation and high-priced talent have managed to come up with anything quite approximating the charms and delights that Dr. Seuss was able to conjure up in just a handful of storybook pages.
"Stanley Nelson revisits the 1978 mass suicide of Jim Jones and his flock in Guyana, savoring the horror but offering no new insights."
"Seth Rogen, Jay Chou, Cameron Diaz and Christoph Waltz try to bring their characters to life in this campy action flick -- but the results end up uneven at best."
"... a sometimes fun, occasionally provocative, and mostly disjointed mess."
"Forget Christmas, this risible early holiday release won't make it until Thanksgiving."
"""Freak Show"" is a hot mess with good intentions."
"This is perhaps the angriest movie Hill - longtime specialist in tough-guy fare such as ""The Driver,"" ""Last Man Standing,"" ""Red Heat"" and ""Bullet to the Head"" - has ever made."
"Lee, in his least commercial film, shoots for controversy but loses focus."
These characters exist in a bubble of happy-go-lucky romance and inevitable tragedy.
The young cast are smug and forgettable; the action sequences barely get going before they're over; and the whole affair is riddled with product placement and pop cultural references ...
A slight movie and a major downer.
"If quirky and twee are not one’s cup of tea, “Brian and Charles” will be an endurance test."
"Incendiary exposes a crucial social dialectic without affixing a relatable, if reductive, human face to the center."
This is what happens when directors with lots of money and powerful computers get all hot and bothered about the latest new toys.
Dark Glasses may be an overfamiliar and unambitious victory lap for Dario Argento&#44; but it&#8217;s still a gas to see the 81-year-old auteur back in the filmmaking saddle&#46;
"Dahl himself thought his book would be impossible to translate into film, and for all the ingenuity that's been thrown at the screen, perhaps he was right. This overgrown peach never ripens."
"El resultado ha encontrado admiradores y detractores; sin llegar a ninguno de los dos extremos, yo tengo la impresión de que vi una buena película pero no me di cuenta."
This mixture of sleazy daytime talk shows and lighthearted romantic comedy makes for a muddled mess with few bright spots.
Somehow Landesman turns a compelling true-life story into a drama that simply doesn't ring true.
A mediocre modern high seas pirate tale.
The film's [directorial] crudity is ultimately an unbearable drag on its joviality.
"The film is nonsense, and what counts is whether viewers will feel able to lay aside their logical complaints and bask in what remains: a trip in search of a tan."
"The characters are woefully underdeveloped, have way less interesting philosophical discussions, and it doesn't work as a thriller either: You can see the multitude of double-crosses coming a mile away."
"Unimpressive, often bothersome, action photography and a surface soapy story line."
"It's really about Lipsky's love of his own words, as every character serves as nothing more than a mouthpiece for identically insipid dialogue."
"Is this 2010, or 1950? It certainly seems the latter, since no contemporary woman with an IQ above Guinness temperature would sit with such nonsense."
"Achieving a kind of clumsy elegance, at times, ""Motherless Brooklyn"" sadly devolves into reams of exposition. It's a film that has a hard time with the visual language of cinema."
The Last Thing Mary Saw feels restrained by its means-unable to emphasize its ultimate payoffs-and beholden to a tiptoe pace that won't ensnare all audiences.
The topic of safety needles is certainly an important one but not one that makes for very interesting drama; the Kassens would have been better off making a doc and having Evans narrate it.
"Boasts a terrific ensemble cast and beautiful, enchanting sights of the City of Love, but it feels too convoluted, unfocused and somewhat bland as a whole."
At no point does this film strive to be more than a second-rate version of what it is: a halfhearted attempt to make some scratch while pretending the devil exists. Some trick.
"It is all set-up and no follow-through. While there is action, it is too late, too few, and too unremarkable to make any dent."
The scary part is that this movie got made.
"The entire point of a shaggy dog story, of course, is that it goes nowhere, and this is classic nowheresville in every sense."
"For a while, the obviousness and flat-out vulgarity are sort of entertaining, and it might be possible to enjoy the movie as a camp classic if you could ignore the mean-spiritedness that keeps breaking through."
It seems more like an expectorant for Edwards' bile than an entertainment aimed at an audience.
I can't stand the moral universe that we're dealing with here.
"This film promises black comedy, outrageous effrontery and sizzling satire. And for about 20 minutes it delivers."
Has an intriguing premise but cuts too many corners in its catechism.
"Tye Sheridan, in an unusual role, plays Bart well as a tech savvy young man with Asperger's syndrome. The young actor obviously studied well and is convincing. But is this film?"
"Mechanic: Resurrection aims to be no more satisfying than an oil change, and no one seems more bored by that prospect than Jason Statham."
"Despite the Lubitsch artistry, much of which is technically apparent, it's not good cinema in toto."
"A new standard for jaw-dropping, eye-scorching awfulness has been established."
"It’s not funny, it’s too long, and I had so many questions that were not answered by the end of the film. I would say maybe your Nan might like it but, even then, unless she’s a Patriots fan, she might be better off watching anything else."
"The Village is not completely awful, but it comes closer than one would like to admit."
More intriguing than it is entertaining.
Just as unimaginative as its premise suggests.
"K-Pax often feels redundant and unsatisfying, like a cinematic version of one of those Reader's Digest condensed books."
"An incoherent, experimental acid trip so unbearably pretentious that it gave me newfound respect for the Warren Commission. A real torture test."
"You can't help comparing this tepid offering with the similarly-themed recent Honeymoon Travels Pvt Limited, which gave us much more."
"No doubt Asian capitalist interests are well-served in the end, there won't be rioting in the streets on the back of this one. A film is hardly effective satire if it doesn't point up a route to radical change."
"All in all, it's a journeyman's enterprise, directed without much imagination by Kevin Bray."
Not an uncontrived moment goes by.
"Russell Crowe heads a starry, largely overqualified cast in Gabriele Muccino's treacly, time-hopping family soap opera."
Barbarian embraces foolish horror tropes to heights so absurd I laughed hysterically throughout&#46; The dim-witted characters have no common sense or self-preservation as they continuously bumble into bad situations&#46; 
"David (Gosling) finds potential salvation in Katie (Kirsten Dunst), a free spirit so saintlike that she verges on caricature."
"It's not as bad as the average Hollywood movie, it's stupendously worse."
Heist is a phoned-in job.
Ghosts is narcissistic and lacks a sharp focus.
This is a bizarre family-orientated musical that requires you to wear thick rose-coloured glasses.
"It's too long, it loses all sense of direction at the 60 minute mark, and so much of the action is phone-based that after a while it starts to feel like an audiobook."
Smith is worth watching; the movie is not.
"if you found the trailer funny you'll probably feel the same way about the movie. If, like me, it made you cringe at how unfunny it was, stay away."
"Delpy sells it hard with her performance but the supporting cast are unconvincing, and the whole thing is a waste of everyone's time."
"Mortal Kombat know what it is, that's for sure. It's catering to fans of the game franchise who always wished the bloody carnage of the series was translated more directly."
"The problem is, the characters eventually start to seem like a couple of idiots."
"God Help the Girl is a quaint, pretentious film, representative of a quaint, pretentious band."
"No amount of still photography, lyrical scene setting or Green's undeniable skill at working with actors can make up for the adolescent, boys'-adventure-story motivations that drive these paper-thin characters to bogus acts of desperation."
Feels more like a sugar crash rather than sensory delight&#46;
Unpleasant drivel that tries to make fun out of murder.
[I]t's almost as if director Marc Webb is himself bored with the material.
I hate this animation and Rodrick does not rule
"""IT'S"" bark is worse than its bite."
"While candy-colored graphics should dazzle kids, Space Chimps has little draw for audiences spoiled by the Pixar-given knowledge that CGI can entertain -- and not just stupefy -- moviegoers of any age."
An anaemic time-waster you've seen before that fails to create tension or generate the suspense this genre cries out for.
There's very little personal dirt in Sarah Palin: You Betcha! that wouldn't be upstaged by Joe McGinniss' recent Palin tell-all.
"If you're not going to do right by these characters, go give Marvel them back. Why are you still trying to make all this money if you're not doing right by the fans?"
There's not much to recommend here besides Caine.
"Has the faults of raucous recent scatological comedies like Bad Teacher, Horrible Bosses, and The Hangover Part II with none of their redeeming facets."
The dopey symbolism of Magda staring down a menacing crab on the beach (get it?) may be the film's biggest takeaway - even a grande dame of the screen can be taken down by stale poetry.
"If Stan does nothing else, it should at least get its four leads some attention."
"Lazy, saccharine and (worst of all) safe, Unfinished Business is a stock image photo of what a raunchy road trip comedy is supposed to look like."
"Given that this is a prequel...there's no suspense, only ninety minutes of lip-smacking sadism. This is entertainment?"
"[Gibson] and the boy make the kind of cross-generational double act that deservedly went out of fashion with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, although it's superficially toughened up with bad language and cigarettes."
"Saddled with this hollow script, Stone pads with elaborate set pieces."
It's as if these characters came from another planet -- arriving on a spaceship disguised as one of the cleanest and friendliest schools in existence.
"A well-executed crime drama that, on a narrative level, finds itself too bogged down in the familiar to achieve genuine lift-off -- let alone anything memorable."
Doesn't really add up to much.
"This is an American film through and through, one that, due to what it is depicting, delves into frankly repulsive and shortsighted territory."
"Instead of a ""Rashomon"" effect meant to muddy a single truth, ""Human Factor"" illustrates four co-equal truths too afraid of each other to compare notes."
"Whatever it is, The Man with the Iron Fists is more plodding than riotous, in desperate need of an actual filmmaker to clarify its sincere tributes and silly winks."
"Most of the acting is lifeless, except for Matthew Fox who is hamming it up more than fat guy at a bacon festival"
This rehash - toned (and dumbed) down for adolescent audiences by the director responsible for taking the slash out of Prom Night - provides thin gruel.
"It's a decent actor showcase, but Richard Jewell does little to illuminate this story and why we should care about it today."
The thing stinks of sophomore year bong hits and reeks of psych 101 cliché.
"The dull thud of Nicholas Mayer's direction, which mixes the custardy platitudes of the original television series with some of the less-thunderous special effects of the latter-day cinema, has everything in place, like a tidy housewife's kitchen."
What made Martin Scorsese attach his name to this rubbish?
"...will appeal most strongly to people near their characters in age, as it's too easy for younger people to wonder why people who have it so good are complaining..."
"Like ""Let's Twist Again,"" it can't play the same familiar chords with lesser lyrics and expect the same results. It isn't quite the revved-up rallying call for outcasts that the first one was, so this sequel is best approached with lower expectations."
"Wilson deserves better, too. He's too smart to make me believe he'd actually think this movie is funny."
"Shark Night, handled with impersonality by Snakes on a Plane pilot David R. Ellis, aspires to nothing more or less than carrying along an audience through a string of unremarkable kills, often involving high-jumping fish."
It makes an audience pay for every two seconds of pleasure with 10 seconds of pain.
Hardwicke insists on toning the film blue in a way that makes the magnificent scenery of the Pacific Northwest seem dreary.
"Lacks the fear and emotion of The Hills Have Eyes, isn't half as witty as Sorority Row and almost entirely consists of the same kill over and over."
Surviving Christmas is exactly what's wrong with Hollywood
"It's downright boring for an hour, then picks up, at least visually, when the zombified are hauled into space and hung there as if in a cosmic closet."
This is just cacophonous mayhem.
"Ultimately the surreal concept is half-baked and poorly executed, which will take audiences out of the movie all leading to an unsatisfying conclusion."
"God is great, the movie's not."
"In 1999, apparently, you need to be more socially responsible in your portrayals of high school horn-dogs."
Director Fisher Stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in Waking Life water colors.
[Doesn't have] anything on its tiny mind besides cheap laughs.
This is light entertainment -- nothing groundbreaking or even especially noteworthy.
There is fun to be had with the magical beasts and characters like Queenie but it's hard to endorse a movie when I can't understand the lead character most of the time.
"It's all a big cinematic jumble and, quite frankly, an expensive-looking mess."
"Assisted by passionless central performances and dull dialogue, Mungiu succeeds only in exhausting our patience, not in conveying a message."
"That Sony wants to break into feature animation may be an admirable goal, but unless future efforts are fresher than this, it begs the question, why bother?"
There's nothing wrong with updating the classics but jimmying in the language of modern dating feels hugely patronising. I'm sure Anne could appeal to millennials without acting like a Fleabag rip off.
"Blood-splattered and ultra-violent, it's amazingly awful and dopey in more ways than one."
"It's just too bad the movie didn't indulge its spookier, supernatural elements more, instead of relying on action movie cliches."
The quick trip through will keep most audiences from reflecting on how dim-witted the film really is.
That playlist proves that Observe and Report was shaped by a hip sensibility. Shame that sensibility didn't have more effect on the script.
The contrivances ... are simply too preposterous and laborious to sit through.
"One of the lamest and cheapest-looking buddy-cop movies to come along since... well, since Blue Streak."
This is what would have been the end result of 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy if Peter Jackson was more concerned with all-flash and no real substance.
It feels unnecessary at best and irresponsible at worst.
Like a generic “John Wick” with vampires.
"All [they] have done is add a lot of uninspired songs and weighty, unnecessary scenes which slow down the action to a crawl, thus turning an essentially light and satirically merry story into a cumbersome and typically overblown Hollywood spectacular. "
"It doesn't have very much to say, but doesn't offend in its inconsequence."
"A sort of futuristic fantasy western with 'The Searchers' as its granddad, 'Priest' is an action adventure that will attract fans of the graphic novel and folks who like fantasy in general."
"Despite some touching moments, the overall impact is slight and forgettable."
Gamers would be better off playing Doom or sitting in front of a blank screen than wasting time with this incredibly dull Aliens rip-off.
"Piecemeal and earnest to a fault, this remake of George Cukor's 1939 film relies so much on the elite world of humorless, filthy rich New York women that it excludes most of its would-be target fans."
"At the end, it looks like a treacly, albeit high-minded Sunday afternoon drama serial."
"Yes offers a case study in the moral complacency of the creative class, and its verbal cleverness cannot disguise the vacuous self-affirmation summed up in the title."
Rim of the World is a spectacular failure at being the kind of early teen sci-fi adventure jaunt they just don't make anymore.
"The rude and raucous heyday of 1980s hair metal is relived in this starry screen version of the jukebox musical, but despite the cast's game efforts the results are disappointingly tame and bland, a toned-down, 12A-version of the era's X-rated excesses."
"This is sort of like Repulsion with zero thrills or sick laughs, a glum ’70s reconstruction rendered in a decidedly contemporary way that doesn’t illuminate then or now."
"My 6 year old enjoyed it. I guess I would just like a little more effort from the filmmakers. Maybe worth a DVD rental, though."
Mostly exhausting&#44; with Chazelle caught up in his ability to summon chaos&#44; leaving little room for compelling drama to take shape&#46;
there's not enough there to escape the nagging feeling that this is simply a thriller with pretensions and uncommonly good actors
"It's a convoluted mess that zig-zags all over the map, but there are enough jokes that connect to keep you along for the ride."
"The sheer glut of stuff has the terrible effect of wrecking the pacing, making the not-egregiously-long movie feel substantially more than in its running time."
Fracture is aptly named. It's one of those movies in which cracks appear the minute you begin to look too closely.
"If The Whole Nine Yards was a by-product of the hit man genre of dark comedies launched by Quentin Tarantino and Pulp Fiction, Ten Yards is just a copy of a copy."
"Blame looks good, that's for sure, but it lacks a spark to really be an engaging movie."
"Cheap and cheerless, Norm's appeal melts faster than the polar ice."
"Alas, in the end, it's not nasty enough."
"Yet again, one senses that Reygadas - instead of simply getting on with the job of making a film - has opted instead to go for an opus magnum that reminds us of cinema's greats"
"Not atrocious, but certainly far from being as good as it might have been."
"Intriguing as their present lives may be, without enough background to appreciate, for instance, Ushio's associations with Rauschenberg and Warhol, we can't gauge the full extent of the couple's regrets and losses."
A deeply unfunny family road trip film that has gross out jokes to rival the R-rated Vacation remake.
"The very act of writing critically about Superhero inspires something of an existential crisis -- no one likely to turn out for it is reading this review, and anybody reading this review is probably not inclined to see it under any circumstances."
"A princess with a curse, a case of mistaken identity and some of the worst special effects in a film by a world-class director."
Painfully disengaged from anything human.
"Cinderella Man is a movie about the indomitability of the American spirit, and those are always far less interesting than movies about actual people."
"As [Clare's] rage melts away so does the story's narrative momentum, leading to the movie's enigmatic, poetic and not entirely satisfying conclusion."
"Fascinating to look at though we hate to sound sore, but this cat should have known that less is way more."
This is just not a good movie.
It's all exactly as unnecessary as it sounds.
"Cianfrance's mesmeric eye for heartbreak is dulled here. The waters are muddied and the pull of The Light Between Oceans falters, despite some fine cinematography."
"At its best, Molly's Game is a lively, entertaining, bracingly articulate film. But the final act may have audiences sorely wishing Sorkin had quit while he was ahead."
"Barrymore ... and Grant are both charming here, and yet there's no chemistry between them at all."
"Cats may flop but it will be found by a likeminded audience, maybe the same one that rescued The Greatest Showman. Don't be the sourpuss to tell these people they're wrong."
There is not one single thing to recommend this found footage film.
[O]nly the startlingly belligerent honesty of Edward Nortons portrayal of the title character that makes this worth a look... [S]omething important is missing here: perhaps from the anticlimactic third act...
An exercise in humiliation for all concerned.
Clumsy and forgettable!
"Peterloo is an entertaining enough experience for those who love the English language but, as a polemic, it's too self-satisfied and short-sighted to gain the impact it seeks."
"Not a single character seems to have a thought they don't overtly state, every plot development is telegraphed as far ahead as the movie can manage, and stressing the apparent idyll by shoehorning in yet another scenery shot happens again and again."
"Taken has run its course...the next time you get this script, Liam, just say no..."
"A long string of picnics, portrait sessions, elaborate dinners, and countryside rituals, filtered through a svelte aesthetic pleasantness that ultimately corrodes its larger interests."
"... As the credits roll at the close of Into the Wild, you don't feel like you've celebrated a life spent on the road less traveled; you feel like you've just witnessed a slow-motion suicide."
"Pandering and illogical, Super 8's plot makes no demands on viewers' intelligence."
"It's all energetically filmed, but I miss the cool, modest clarity of the first version. Bigger isn't always better, even at the movies."
"Female characters should be allowed to engage in raunchy humor on the big screen; they already do on the small one with Sex and the City. But unlike that HBO series, The Sweetest Thing has no guts."
There's something wrong in the cinematic design of House of Gucci.
This Hollywood adaptation is as glossy as Christmas wrapping paper and just as disposable.
"Unfortunately, this film wastes a frightening premise and is about as scary as an intense game of Candy Land."
"In the end, one is left, not with a work of art, not with a document but with a cliché. It is an inadequate monument, even to a pair of stupid criminals."
The Passenger becomes nothing more than an extended chase&#44; punctuated by some gore and a pretty bleak finale&#46;
There are a few lovely things in this film that make it easier for us to forgive its shortcomings&#46; But so you know&#44; Empire of Light is no magic movie&#46;
"Some intriguing dialogue, and a closet full of fantastic frocks, can't help an impressive ensemble cast save this movie from being a lackadaisical picture, far removed from anything remotely exciting as chaos."
A general rule of thumb has emerged: Movies in 3-D almost always feature dimensionless people. Ben-Hur is a striking example of this rule.
Overly broad and silly at times.
"Because this is set in Los Angeles in the 1970s, we're supposed to think back to Chinatown and The Long Goodbye and excuse the opaque plot, around which Black's eccentric gags float like seasoned croutons in bland soup."
"Those wanting to see a film devoid of clichés and implausibility should look elsewhere. Still, Hopkins is terrific, inhabiting the role like, well, a man possessed."
"Like the first film, Cars 2 runs out of gas. Unlike the original, this one fails to cross the finish line."
"A tardy romance between two aging lovebirds, Elsa & Fred is predictable fare that only occasionally fulfils its intention of being simultaneously heartbreaking and heartening."
"In this noisy, joyless, bizarrely static fiasco, every element on screen seems to let the air out of the one before it."
That hissing sound you hear in the theater is not footballs losing air but an audience deflated.
"Seeing former cinema clowns like Robin Williams and Tom Hanks clutching sweet, sweet Oscar gold must have lit a fire under [Smith's] thespian aspirations..."
"Sluggish, witless and desperately twee."
Much too tired and mean-spirited to be funny.
"The sequel suffers from a lame, saccharine premise and a fatally earnest manner."
I didn't find any great pleasure in seeing a story play out [the way] I knew exactly how it was going to play out.
"After one of the best chase sequences of any movie this year, it literally slams into an ending that doesn't feel very much like an ending at all, leaving viewers adrift in a sea of unanswered spy questions."
But unfortunately&#44; this thematically shallow adaptation of Barker&#8217;s brilliant work of gothic&#44; erotic horror doesn&#8217;t live up to its damnable title&#46;
"In the grand scheme of Coen brothers' scripts with nimwits making hugely bad decisions, Fargo exists on one brilliant end while Suburbicon lands with a hearty thud somewhere on the other side."
"Much of Alexander plays like a Monty Python sketch, and much of it plays like an SCTV parody. Little of it plays like an epic."
"As the token adults, Carla Gugino looks concerned, which is understandable, and Gary Oldman shouts a lot, possibly to keep himself awake."
"Filomarino keeps Beckett running for his life, but we have no incentive to care whether he'll live or die."
Impishly wooden and convoluted...a lazy tiptoe through tripe perceptions of what an alpha female perceives as relating to her meathead male colleagues.
"The Book Thief is a bland adaptation, with a safe, slow-moving script that drains the life (and death) from a vivid and moving bestseller."
This is slickly made production-line horror that never attempts to do more than merely go through the motions - and not even actors of the calibre of Morgan and Kyra Sedgwick (as Em's mother Stephanie) are able to bring it to life.
"A Series of Unfortunate Events meets Goosebumps and Harry Potter, only without bringing anything new or surprising to its witchy, haunted house narrative."
Condemn it to obscurity if you can.
"Padilha captures some of this weirdness, but his meandering narrative never seems certain where to focus. It's entirely possible to reduce seven days to less than two hours, but you need to know which seconds count."
Underworld: Blood Wars is a nonsense movie that barely hangs together and no one seems interested in actually being in it.
"The writers seem to have been reared in the ""Lost"" school of storytelling, happy to pile on three more questions for every answer."
"This is the sort of movie that not only asks the audience to leave their brains at the door, but to throw it out the window."
"Re-creating Auschwitz somehow domesticates it; the smokestacks look like pieces from an infernal Monopoly board, while the extras appear suspiciously well-fed."
Texas Chainsaw Massacre&#160;fails to evoke new life into the franchise&#46; In turn&#44; it&apos;s an entry that falls in line with some of the worst horror reboots in quite some time&#46; It&apos;s lifeless and guilty of the biggest cinematic sin of all - being pointless&#46;
Inside features several interesting ideas&#44; but no two of them are strung together with anything resulting in intriguing imagery&#44; propulsive stakes&#44; or meaningful human drama&#46;
I can't recommend this movie to anyone older than high school age.
Like a bowl of frozen soup - takes much too long to heat up.
"An all-action, helter-skelter, don't-forget-to-buy-the-computer-game ride that makes the two previous installments look like models of classic filmmaking."
Lacking in emotional impact.
"3 suffers in comparison to the insanely inventive 2, which found wittier ways to exploit the idea that laughing and screaming are closely linked methods of relieving tension."
There are plenty of movies that prove entertaining despite their familiarity; this isn't one of them.
"The technical deficiencies could be overlooked if the story were great, but it's merely average. It has laughs, and smiles, and a couple memorable characters, but it doesn't have enough of any of those things."
"The nonlinear structure works to the film's advantage, but at times the dank, heavy moodiness becomes postured and distractingly overwrought."
"It's just a shame that the dialogue and plotting can't match the message and the jolts of well-executed genre thrills. It's bold and kind of fun, but this is a step down from Anarchy."
What possessed Shia LaBeouf to get a massive tattoo for this underachieving gangster film?
This chronicle of scavenger and self-centered journalism reminded me of the case of a Mexican television journalist. Neither the real case nor this one starring Léa Seydoux is particularly interesting. What a bore.
"Bill Duke directed this mixture of high energy and low vulgarity, which doesn't do justice to the talents of its mostly black cast."
"Garfield himself (voiced by Bill Murray) is once again strikingly unlikable, a bloated, bingeing fascist."
Perhaps it's fitting that this story about babies has the attention span and grasp of logic of a newborn.
"[S]hockingly, appallingly inept, and it keeps getting worse and worse, as if it were descending into its very own bespoke circle of cinematic hell... Depp [is] parodying himself, which is hugely unpleasant to watch..."
"In spite of the available chemistry and charisma from Hathaway and Ejiofor, Locked Down proves to be a bewildering mess, in part because of choices made in how to tell a story that mixes two-hander drama with a heist."
"Sacrificing electricity and artistry, the portrait it paints is by-the-numbers rather than an original masterpiece."
"Given the spectacular backdrop of Versailles as her playpen, Coppola reduces history into a pop Halloween party .... Forget the liberty, equality and fraternity stuff. Let's just get to, 'Off with their heads!'"
"The different stories never end up balancing. The dialogue is simple, too flat, despite very good intentions. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Rogue One does a brilliant job capturing the look and feel of Star Wars, but narratively, it's a footnote, and some of the creative choices are baffling."
"The moment two youngsters appear more frightening than attacking aliens, you can't help suspecting there'll be additional moviemaking trouble ahead. And you're right."
The pop diva goes down with the bubbles in this hopelessly shallow soap opera.
"The storyline is hackneyed and nonsensical, as if Loraine had plucked clichs from episodes of The Professionals and strung them together."
"Jungle Cruise is pretty boring, mostly unpleasant to watch, and seems to be a gigantic waste of time and money, all of which it honestly pains me to say to you."
"'Don't go all Waiting to Exhale on me,' advises one of Clarice's soul sisters late in the film. If only."
"I cannot believe this is the Todd Haynes who topped my ten-best list in 2002 with the magnificent, unforgettable Far From Heaven. Headed for the No. 1 spot on my ten-worst list, I'm Not There is a tumultuous disappointment."
Year One buckles at the first bad gag and it's downhill from there.
"Poorly written, directed, and acted, only a few generous location shots of Israel save this film from being the worst carbon-copy picture of all time."
"The Aftermath could have made for one hell of a mini-series. With the freedom of time in its corner, it could have given more breathing room to those tangled subplots and greater space for these emotions to play out."
Maria Montez delivers two terrible performances for the price of one.
Catch That Kid? You shouldn't bother.
"Same old silliness, only worse."
"Rather than thoughtfully reflect on post-collegiate ennui and disillusionment, the film settles for erecting a monument to its main character's awesomeness."
... there's the assembly-line predictability of it all.
The film's non-stop cinematic cheap thrills come at the expense of credibility and taste.
"If stars could be awarded on the basis of good intentions, The Grey Zone should be king of the galaxy. Unfortunately, it lands on earth with something of a thud."
"The Final Nightmare marks an end to Freddy's wisecracking ways. This surrealistic nightmare fits the style perfectly, but sometimes lacks in imagination."
"This sort of legal-eagle premise worked beautifully in the bygone Tracy and Hepburn days, declined when the Coen brothers made Intolerable Cruelty, and hits rock bottom here."
A date movie for the undiscriminating...Anyone who might accidentally think about what they're seeing should probably stay away.
"My God, this thing goes on. By the time the two get busy in Christian's ""playroom,"" the oomph has gone out of the whole erotic setup ..."
It's overly long and there's not enough connective tissue.
"People answer in punchlines here, and leave it to director Reitman to always lead with irony."
It's uncomfortable to take a negative stance against something that is so plainly a labor of love. But the sad truth is that the movie doesn't offer enough to make it interesting or even diverting.
"This brazen mix of old and new is undermined by the predictable story, shallow characterizations and a dopey sense of humor that evokes Monty Python and the Holy Grail without actually being especially funny."
"I'm a Chloë Grace Moretz fan, but she keeps getting entwined in these odd live-action/animation and special FX flicks..."
"Even with all the context it provides its protagonist, the film still reduces him to an average teenage asshole. It may be an inversion of the usual boring heart-of-gold bland sports movie hero, but it's still bland."
A convoluted mess.
"Unfortunately, this levity is paired with a truly painful father-son relationship."
"Wan is basically just remaking his own Insidious with a few modest tweaks and a polyester wardrobe, and, just like that movie, The Conjuring gets progressively less scary as it goes along."
"If legendary shlockmeister Ed Wood had ever made a movie about a vampire, it probably would look a lot like this alarming production, adapted from Anne Rice's novel The Vampire Chronicles."
"The dopey duo have a few decent lines, though Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum already showed us how to do the pseudo-cop routine in the Jump Street pictures."
"It forgets story, suspense, and inherent terror, in exchange for a silly, preachy, and convoluted premise."
Faith-driven audiences deserve better...
"The humor, most of which comes from a monk as a comic sidekick, doesnt work here either. It just emphasizes how campy the whole premise really is."
"Not worth its weight in issues, ultimately playing out as the most generic, uninspired thriller that fails to make good on any of its bonkers ingredients."
"The little guys [the filmmakers' target audience] are going to be thrilled with the adventure, the plethora of critters and their bright colors."
"Stays in the ring, just like its hero, but without much sense of direction."
Hollywoodland has too many leaks. The movie is also too ambitious for its own good.
"At risk of sounding silly, the main problem with 'Snow White and the Huntsman' is that it's about Snow White and the huntsman."
"This murky thriller is more of a pig's ear than a pearl earring. The actors, mostly British, speak with sinister furrin accents."
Unbearably tedious and mildly insulting.
Enough already with the famous-equals-feminist school of female icons - it's not enough to simply dress well.
[T]he execution is so clumsy that nothing fruitful comes of it.
"A feature best suited for the fast-forward button, where viewers can race to the best parts without having to deal with what passes for suspense in this ridiculous follow-up."
the anti-Social Network
"If BET made after school specials, this is what they would look like."
"The Stones have been the subject of some great documentaries, but Scorsese makes no new discoveries here."
"Hollywood should give pre-teens more credit; they read Shakespeare, and even comprehend the intricacies of the stories."
Lacks much of the sense of fun that made the original film a blast.
"Like ""The Hangover,"" this film seems to seek an audience of mostly men, high-fiving across the aisle."
"Blade II is slick, high-tech mayhem that will appeal more to comic book and video games fans than it will to horror aficionados."
"Predators is a pretty good action movie for about 45 minutes. Unfortunately, it lasts 106."
Instead of a subversive earworm it becomes nothing but a forgettable foray into torture porn and the most tropey parts of horror.
"The style is cut and pasted from other movies, and without a stronger sense of the characters and story, there's not much else to see here"
"Most of the action scenes occur in the dark and are so heavily edited, it's hard to know whose limbs and faces are being splintered by Cole."
"A fast-moving puzzler that, on a minute to minute basis, is moderately engaging but by the close has become a rather heavy-handed bit of hokum."
"doomed to late-night rotation on some high-digit, bargain-basement cable channel"
Black Adam wants to be the film that &#8220;rights&#8221; the DCEU&#44; but it&#8217;s just another messy&#44; shallow entry into a sloppy canon that won&#8217;t commit to real ideas&#46; 
"Anyone who doesn't see the film's ""twist"" ending coming from miles away just hasn't seen enough thrillers."
While effectively made&#44; this movie retreads common tropes that leave the viewer with few &#8211; if any &#8211; surprises&#46;
"Simply put, Snatch stinks."
"The germs of a few good ideas reside within the bowels of The Vow, but the movie is too preoccupied with pushing chick-flick buttons to cultivate them."
This 'based on a true story' omits unpleasant facts and is unfreckled hagiography set into a background of marital perfection.
"If you're over 15 and semi-intelligent, you'll want your money back."
"Rife with clichés from a roll call of high-concept blockbusters that came before it, from Gladiator to Titanic to Roland Emmerich's disaster oeuvre."
"Honestly, if this wasn't a remake, it's a fair bet you might not have any idea of what exactly was supposed to be going on."
"[It's] a blend of trite plot points and obnoxious characters, held together by the notion that you should be watching something else instead."
Home Sweet Home Alone will never live up to the original but it just goes to show that Hollywood won't stop remaking classics.
"As the 13-year gap between ""Nemo"" and ""Dory"" indicates, this was not a concept that cried out to be made."
"Malek's sublime performance and the smashing soundtrack of Queen's greatest hits are ultimately masking a generic, by-the-numbers film that consistently plays it far too safe."
An undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic.
"What's missing is charm. The book had tons of it, while the movie buries it beneath an avalanche of movement and busy design."
Various subplots are given short shrift and the whole thing feels more like a Cliff's Notes version of a longer piece than an actual finished motion picture.
"A wild dream that spins into a nightmare, Moonlight isn't quite as provocative as it aims to be."
[Seth MacFarlane's] sense of humor generally bodes about as well for moviegoers as a dorsal fin does for swimmers.
"If the historical backdrop which the film is set in is well-portrayed, it is the shaggy-dog plotting that is the problem."
"Winkler and Cocks almost convince us that, despite his secrets, success and tortured later life, Porter is not interesting enough to warrant big-screen treatment."
[I]t combines a naked desire to please the audience with a try-anything approach of the kind that made Wedding Crashers such a desperate stab at entertainment.
"This film should be an amazing thrill ride, but it has the emotional impact of a bowling ball at rest."
Meretricious excuse for an inspirational tale.
"Sadly, the most interesting characters in ""Humpday"" are not the main focuses of the story."
"Elle is such a nice person, and Witherspoon so effervescent, it seems impolite to point out that this comedy is hardly ever funny, unless you get a big kick out of seeing small dogs in cute outfits. Over and over and over again."
"Neeson and McGregor seem so focused on hitting their marks for the blue screen, that they barely make eye contact, let alone generate any genuine emotion."
"The point of the whole thing - the reason this movie was made, and the reason we're watching it - gets drowned beneath a series of memorable but disconnected images and moments."
"Two hours of nihilistic, non-stop violence with barely a plot and one of the most annoying music scores of all time. It makes me weep for our future."
"Adam Sandler is not funny. Nothing he does is funny. His movies, with a couple exceptions, aren't funny."
"The sequel is flat, its PG-13 rating undermining some of the comic raunch of the first film."
A gangster-heist thriller that lacks that crucial element that makes any thriller - any thrills at all.
Apostle leaves a lot to be desire despite great potential.
Infighting over the purpose of this detail as well as a group of German soldiers&#44; intent on retrieving their Fuhrer&apos;s remains&#44; provide the conflict of this at times plodding&#44; muddled movie&#46; 
Awkwardly blends family comedy and sex farce and winds up with squat.
Has the bounce of a beach ball with a six-inch hole.
The film's failure can be attributed primarily to the unreasonably slow pace and surfeit of ridiculous plot twists...
"De Niro suffers most of the head-banging indignities in ""Little Fockers."" The more he throws himself into the reaction shots and the mugging, the more you wonder if he's really having a good time with this desperate material."
It&apos;s supposed to Tarantino-esque&#44; and cute&#44; and Antoine Fuqua-riveting-action-y&#44; and hilarious&#44; but it&apos;s just none of the above&#46; Miss this train&#46;
"If it were a meticulously-tailored bespoke suit, House of Gucci seems to have the right material, especially the terrific cast, to put it all together. Alas, the execution (no pun intended) doesn't quite measure up."
"Destiny pervades the project, and anyone who expected Stone to toe anything other than the company line was gravely mistaken."
"It's a film filled with laughter and, most importantly, love and forgiveness, as this father-son pair search for the meaning in their lives and begin to heal."
"The in-your-face 3-D effects -- debris flying, etc. - are fun at times, but not enough to justify the darkened screen or warrant wearing those glasses and paying extra."
"The comedy is not revolting garbage, but actually well-written, rapid-paced and funny enough to squeeze howls out of the audience at least once every five minutes. That's not to say Barry Sonnenfeld's film isn't as dumb as an Arizona State football player"
"There's no doubt that Pedro Almodvar is a twisted master, but his newest gender-bending romp stumbles over itself."
"Only Brooke Smith is distinctive as supporting player Cassie. Amanda Peet is a natural for Woody's style, but is saddled with one of Allen's most cliched characters"
"The convincing effects will only whet your appetite and leave you hungry for something more substantial, as you're left to wonder which cast members knew the campiness of the concept."
An hour-and-a-half story stretched to over two hours while feeling like it's three.
Nowhere near as good as the original but better than the second installment.
"If Gossling was trying to say something about diversity in the mid-west as I suspect she was, the cringey dialogue needed to be far less on the nose and her characters not as frustratingly silly."
A disappointing flick.
"Robert Rodriguez's intentions seem honorable: to make a charming, low-tech, 3-D movie for children, based on the writings of his preteen son. But the result is astoundingly boring and, frankly, tedious to sit through."
Heather's half-hearted and half-funny send up of the sorts of roles Hollywood has pigeon-holed her into
It's entirely possible that Gaghan just isn't an actor's director.
Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace seems designed more as a promotion for Lucasfilm's billion-dollar merchandising concerns than a meaningful chapter in the Star Wars canon.
"Stewart's sophomoric approach to exposing the sins of campaign financing and other egregious ploys used to win an election at any cost, including the one Stewart employs here --- the race for mayor in a small Wisconsin town --- is ultimately insulting."
"A phony, simplistic and cheap way for Eastwood to address an important and complicated social issue. At least Swank kicks butt."
"Increasingly, the film takes on a lighter, rosy glow as Olavi's redemption pulls up in the rear, tending to enhance the artificiality of its resolution."
An utterly predictable entrant in the Cougedy genre sees a yummy-mummy (Zeta-Jones) and her 25 year-old babysitter (Bartha) tumble into love after she takes her two young children to a new life in New York.
Brad Anderson's film is defined by an often frustrating combination of cleverness and stupidity.
Forgettably destined to join the pantheon of Decidedly Ordinary Summer Popcorn Movies.
"Thriller directorial debut for Traffic scribe Gaghan has all the right parts, but the pieces don't quite fit together."
Bad rom-coms are my kryptonite and more often than not I find them mostly all bad. So the fact that Ticket to Paradise -- despite the Roberts-Clooney collective -- sent me screaming into the hills should shock absolutely nobody.
"I find Margot Robbie's performance disposable as the clown's carefree, volatile girlfriend. It is a dull, predictable and empty movie. [Full review in Spanish]"
The production lacks much dramatic credibility and often teeters on the edge of the ludicrous.
Offers no more enlightenment or catharsis than a drugged insect could expect in the moment before it is skewered by a lepidopterist's pin.
"Once you've seen one beheading or similarly bloody killing, you've seen them all, and that's all of any vague interest that Carpenter has to offer here."
Alex Kurtzman taps his family tree for enough sap to start a treacle factory.
As kinetic as its hero but as conservative as his story.
'The cast was available' is no reason to make a sequel.
"The great weakness, ultimately, of the film is that its ambivalence, unease and discomfort about American realities in general and the ""war on terror"" in particular are not placed in the forefront, developed or worked through to the end."
"Papushado's flamboyance feels cocky and indiscriminate, as if he's simply trying really hard to make every image seem cool."
"The film thinks it wants to be sincere, when all it truly wants is to be popular, just like the other kids' movies, so it sells off its originality."
"For a movie filled with amateur porn, sex toys, cocaine and Cameron Diaz's butt, ""Sex Tape"" is awfully tame."
"Dog Years is a collection of old-fogey clichés, with a narrative that mixes a career retrospective with a road trip."
"It's a Salinger we've met before, in dozens of biographies, memoirs and critical studies that came and went through the years."
"The sappiest heartland hokum squeezable from the novelist's formula bottle, this adaptation drip-drip-drips into a well of clichd sentiment, its last big manufactured teardrop saved for the perfectly ridiculous ending."
"Shepard's story isn't tight enough to rein in Brosnan, who's emotionally all over the map as the globetrotting assassin."
"To alternate fistfights and gunplay with paternal tenderness is a tall order for any action movie, and to do so without slowing things down is nearly impossible."
The movie is a shapeless mess that lands with a pathetic thud.
"It's heartbreaking, of course, but also crassly manipulative and blandly shot, too."
A mishmash of a romantic comedy with one of the weakest and most unbelievable scripts of the year so far.
"Whereas the previous chapters were sweetly anarchic, full of wisecracks and narrative digressions but also curious about eco-issues such as global warming and the extinction of species, this effort is dramatically inert and uninspired."
"When it comes down to it, you'd probably be wiser to stick with Glee. You get roughly the same amount of musical numbers, equally melodramatic storylines and hammy acting in less than half the time."
"There just isn't enough wit or style or verve to pull it off. It takes a great premise and then not only fails to run with it, but also fails to go absolutely anywhere with it at all."
The chance to explore the swiftly changing culture of Web-age journalism is one of several intriguing possibilities that State of Play squanders.
"This is dark stuff, but the Whites script opts for broad, light-hearted comedy instead of a biting satire. Moreno is having a ball here, so much so that it almost makes The Prank worth recommending. Almost."
Director Stevens certainly has a lot of ideas and is starting to show a promising career in indie horror&#44; but in this new venture his pretentions may lose a few fans&#46;
"It feels like some Nickelodeon-like teen detective script. In fact, with new character names, this just as easily could have been called Veronica Mars: The Early Years."
Pathetically stupid - forget it!
One of the biggest issues is that Captain America isn't all that super.
Elephant is a lurid tease posing as an art film.
It tells more than it shows.
"It doesn't do the original any particular dishonor, but neither does it exude any charm or personality."
It might be best to discreetly misplace your invitation to these strained festivities.
"We see a lot of events, and hear a lot of talking, but it never seems to mean anything in terms of who these people are."
It's a mutant piece of entertainment that's bound to leave fans feeling betrayed and everyone else befuddled.
"There is more to like in Sing Street than there is to hate, but it is the missteps that truly stay with you."
"I Trapped The Devil never really seems to take off, its moody meditation about the nature of good and evil only proves satisfying for a limited run."
When did feature-length comedies like this one come to settle for indistinguishably 'colorful' characters as a substitute for anything really funny or sharp to say about American daily life?
"""The Little Hours"" is a bawdy bagatelle that has more than a few droll moments. But it was probably at its most pleasurable and amusing in the making."
"Though The Dilemma refers to a singular predicament, the film miscalculates its total number of problems ... particularly with regard to its grab-bag of styles running throughout."
"In other words, Dupieux's commitment to being silly is admirable, but the resistance to making his silly meaningful is exhausting."
"It's a lousy ending stapled to an underwhelming picture, leaving Rushlights more of a bungled card trick than a steamy, scary ride of intimidation."
"Music video-trained director Francis Lawrence whips up a witch's brew of gray-on-gray atmosphere, but for all the end-of-the-world mumbo jumbo, nothing much ever seems to be at stake."
"Could you keep the noise down a touch, Vin? You're going to wake up the audience."
"Aesthetically, Insidious operates at the level of a decent high school video project."
... easily the R-rated sex and gore movie every 14-year old teen secretly sneaks up to watch after his parents go to bed.
"The moviemakers are too busy digitizing ice castles on Mars to bother with much in the way of meta-commentary. Or, for that matter, with personalities."
...disappointing for a film that seems to want to be more than the chronicle of three bros on a mountain but doesn't know how to get there.
"Directed by the young actor Adam Goldberg, ""I Love Your Work is an attempt to say something interesting about modern celebrity."
"[A] dark, dreary and dull ""Mad Max in Neutral"""
"I'm sure [director] Apted meant well, but Amazing Grace comes across as a surprisingly graceless biopic narrowed down to one white man's uncomfortable burden."
"The movie drowns the deeper questions it raises in a sadistic procedural, an endless circular motion of fight scenes whose only justification is themselves."
I can't recall the last [film] that filled me with the kind of utter loathing and contempt that this one did.
"Sure, there's a rubber-necky attraction to watching these good-looking, half-baked creations living anguished, photogenic lifestyles. But it's unclear if we're supposed to feel engaged."
Um universo de melodrama e clichs...
A good script is the most essential ingredient for a good movie. Hiring a comedian isn't enough.
"In ten years, they couldn't come up with enough new ideas that they had to copy so many from the first one?"
"What happens when you put a rabbi, a Buddhist monk, a high-strung capitalist, and a lesbian humanitarian together in the same room? Not comedy, it turns out."
"Sleazy, sweaty and unsatisfying - a waterlogged potboiler."
"A dreamy young extraterrestrial (Elle Fanning) languidly greets him, and asks ""how do I further access the punk?"". What happens next is not edifying."
Unfortunately this movie just gives us more of the same but at a much lower and lazier production level&#46; 
"Would have been... more entertaining as an absurdist comedy about the troubles one woman will go through in order to not live in Queens, the Bronx or (God forbid) Jersey."
What's most remarkable about the film is how it's somehow even worse than that sounds.
"Welcome to a movie that makes absolutely zero sense and didn't need to exist. From the acting to the story to the direction, there's nothing redeemable here."
Ja Rule is not a good leading man. But he's better than some of the other actors in this film. This was not an enjoyable experience.
The Prom takes giant leaps (literally and metaphorically) in its story progression without earning it.
"By pandering to the Avatar market's debased taste and indifference to storytelling details, this technically polished, emotionally crude remake sets back the advances that once had been made in horror movies."
What an awful misfire this is... and it's really sad given all the people involved in it.
"Self-ingratiatingly, and for this viewer maddeningly, it blends the comic with the Christly, the satirical with the sentimental, the free-thinking with the fuddy-duddy."
"Cooper and especially Helms barely register, their boredom with the franchise bordering on disdain. Cooper repeatedly asks a question that, sans obscenities, translates to ""Who cares?"""
"The filmmakers are out of ideas, and Season represents their laziest tendencies to blindly follow whatever worked in earlier, better pictures without risking a shot at a genuine test of skill."
"By the looks of it, Fox went all out for the third and final installment in its Maze Runner trilogy. The question is, will anybody care?"
Action speaks louder than words in a betwixt and between sequel that arrives 18 years after the spookily successful franchise's 'Trilogy' ended.
"It says a lot about this robustly filthy but shambolic comedy that there is a running gag featuring Zac Efron getting repeatedly punched in the scrotum, from behind, by Robert De Niro."
Splinter is about a scary as a tussle between four vacationers and a small porcupine.
"You simply don't get a sense that Lanie's learned anything, other than that being too ambitious is a really bad thing."
Worthwhile intentions are offset by heavy-handed melodrama in this earnest glimpse into the true-life tension surrounding the racial integration of Boston schools through a 1974 busing mandate&#46;
"Clever as it is, the film lacks charm."
Hay and Manfredi ... keep the revelations coming ... instead of taking the time to actually explore these characters or this situation in any significant way.
It's just kind of mediocre.
"... the real cursed are ticket buyers expecting a scary ride, which they won't get."
Laverty has a proven track record as a grim social realist; he is less assured as a comic fantasist; and he is absolutely hopeless when he tries to combine the two.
"Apart from the notoriety of their relationship, there isn't much else going for this movie."
"Despite flashes of vicious inspiration, The Nightshifter is mostly content to pummel its distasteful protagonist with tiresome haunted-house shocks."
"Holmes should be commended for wanting to spotlight the condition of the homeless and indigent, but her distance from this population is too great and her artistic skill too limited at this point to save her film from its amateurishness."
"If you thought Zack Snyder's previous films, among them 300 and Watchmen, were over the top - cliché-embracing, muscle-bound pseudo-triumphs of digital effects over storytelling - they have nothing on Sucker Punch."
... a neat idea with some interesting visuals that flounders in execution.
"""The Kitchen"" may be based on a graphic novel but it feels more like a cartoon."
Paterno attempts to say a lot of things about a lot of different subject matters... None of them are achieved particularly well.

A man in his late 70s is simply not believable doing the things Bryson attempted in his early 40s.
A movie of great possibilities and great failings.
"Handsome Chinese costume actioner mixing power struggles, financial crises and romance a century ago may impress American audiences, but story overkill and subtleties of Chinese culture and history confound."
American Pie grows long in the tooth
A romance aiming at a tone of jazz-riff larkishness but somewhat undermined in that pursuit by the washboard-stiffness of its main characters.
"I keep my fingers crossed that ""The Host"" tanks at the box office and we never have to suffer a sequel - which is set up at the happily ever after ending."
"When this mix of hopeful and edgy works, you get something like ""Little Miss Sunshine."" And when it doesn't, you get a cocktail with a bad smell, one part sunny to two parts vulgar."
"What is the one image you remember from reading Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre? Got it? Well, it's missing from this latest adaptation."
"Octavia Spencer expands her range yet again, but Tate Taylor's suspense/horror pastiche is as messed up as its titular character."
"This is not a new, or a clear, message at all...for a movie trying to stand out so much, it's pretty forgettable. Some of it was funny, and I did like the first half."
"Equals is, by and large, an absolutely disastrous young-adult knockoff that builds to an action-packed yet wholly uninvolving finish..."
"The film is stuffed with noble intentions... But Banks' vision of women-empowerment heaven plays more like a checklist of topics from the feminist discourse of the past few years than a coherent movie, let alone a crowd-pleasing one."
"Watching it is a soul-numbing experience, but that probably won't keep it from being a big hit."
Zack Snyder delivers his zombie heist flick but it falls into predictable pitfalls despite a promising plot.
"100% Fresh, is an hour and 13 minutes long. The last 13 minutes is great. The first hour is not. Use your fast-forward button wisely."
"While it struggles to be erotic or even a thriller, our two leads carry this bland film to a decent martial drama. "
"Aside from leading lady Lindy Booth and a directorial style that screams for a smarter screenplay, there's very little here that'll thrill the horror hounds and/or the gore gourmets."
Kid-friendly violence -- what a concept.
"The final go-cart chase is halfway exciting, but nothing can prepare you for the movie's maudlin right-wing finale."
"Looking more like a Hallmark Movie-of-the-Week and reading like a CliffNotes summary of the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in the 1890s, the $9-million historical romance Princess Kaiulani won't raise any eyebrows or ruffle feathers..."
"Protagonists Jacob and Anna are no Romeo and Juliet, despite writer/director Drake Doremus' fraudulent but manful attempts to make them seem so -- at the end of the day, their problems could be solved by a plane ticket and less self-involvement."
At best&#44; the Ant-Man entries should really be about 90 minutes long&#44; have more humor and less kitchen sink being thrown at me&#46;
Pretty Problems offers occasional laughs but too often indulges staid sitcom-style conventions while grossly outstaying its welcome.
"The direction from first-timer Jim Field Smith is bland and without character, and you feel that if someone with more confidence and a swagger to their filmmaking had been in charge we'd have seen something that stepped beyond cinematic mediocrity"
A 90-minute blab session between a bunch of horny dudes that could easily have been called In the Company of Idiots.
"Besson is unable to weave the comic scenes together with the serious gory ones, so both seem increasingly jarring and unbelievable."
"It's a dunderheaded follow-up, for sure, but it's at least buoyed by Chris Hemsworth's charisma and the few times where Winter's War embraces complete camp."
"Peopled as it is with stereotypes, it's easy to see the script the way Rose sees Irwin: 'Is that you, under all that oldness?'"
"Somehow All My Life seems oddly lacking in stakes, which is so weird considering the story (the main symptoms of onscreen Chau's deadly but photogenic disease seem to be a little tiredness and sweatiness)."
[T]he screenwriters and director Babak Najafi care about these characters ... [T]he filmmakers also are willing to dismiss those concerns in favor of plot and action.
"I also call foul on the standardization of sexual violence against women in horror films. More often than not, this component provides no dramatic value and it's used for titillation's sake..."
"An ambitious attempt to capture the lightning of love in a bottle, Find Love falls victim to implausible situations and a forced sense of romantic urgency."
"Duff beyond words, with some appealing performances wasted."
It's just a bit too weird and over-the-top.
"James Cameron's deeply disappointing Titanic is a sad thing when set against the modest, factual 1958 film, A Night to Remember."
"Alvin and the Chipmunks goes in one eye and out the other, featuring a CGI Alvin, Simon and Theodore interacting with a human-ish world."
"It's best to turn your brain off, half an hour in."
"Subtlety is not a concept but giddy as it is, The Great Gatsby lacks the lunatic excess of Moulin Rouge!"
The most positive general attribute about Deepwater Horizon is the authenticity of its action.
"Apart from some modestly amusing princess shtick and a pleasantly slapsticky opening, there's no real reason for anyone over the age of 11 to see this one."
The Protégé is as unimaginative as its title. What could have been a next-level action showcase for star Maggie Q is instead a boring and idiotic retread of so many other movies about assassins out for revenge.
"Despite a fascinating concept, a gorgeous look and a silky score, 'Clone' is difficult to warm to."
"[""Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen"" should appeal to very young teenage girls or people who are easily amused watching shiny things."
"On the surface, [it] has all the makings of a fantasy cult classic: strange characters, musical interludes and a Jim Henson-like flair. Too bad the plot, music and jokes are lackluster. At most, it'll make you want to watch another, better fantasy film."
"If The Benchwarmers were a real ball game, the mercy rule would end the punishment in the first 15 minutes."
"[Campbell] can't overcome the basic tension of trying to elicit honest, conscience-tweaking audience reactions in the context of a broadly entertaining movie."
Here is what I am certain of: iMoonfall/i is bad. Here is what else I am certain of: I had a great time watching it. 
"Short, silly and charmingly harmless, it's likely only the Stooges aficionados will find a whole lot to love."
"The four credited screenwriters fall back on the same whacks, kicks, punches, and musical montages that continuously bring down the bulk of the best cartoons."
"Sun Tzu believed that becoming predictable would lead to disaster. Apparently, the creators of The Art of War couldn't be bothered to take him to heart."
The new Muppets movie lacks the kind of excitement the first ones generated.
So much obvious thought has gone into making the film visually striking that the script seems to have gone unread. There's no other explanation for the woeful stupidity of some of the characters' actions and the blandness of the dialogue.
"Boyle is only peripherally involved in the sequel, 28 Weeks Later, which has the same stylishness and pulp energy, but none of Boyle's desire to avoid the polemical."
They're trotting it around at all the festivals trying to distract everyone from how bad it is.
"Third times are rarely charms in the movies, much less fourth go-rounds, and it takes more than ho-hum 3D and video-game-ready action sequences to liven up diminishing returns."
"Trotting out the same types of scares, the same plot structure and the same found-footage format gets less effective with each installment."
"Sadly, this all feels like a wasted effort."
A Richard Curtis-esque rom-com that then rather noisily segues into a strange heist movie set in Harrods.
"No doubt about it, to divulge the plot would spoil the experience -- you'll be shocked to discover, and maybe even surprised to learn, just how lame the damn thing really is."
Matt Damon can't save The Great Wall from underachieving with a beautiful movie that's all style and no substance.
Terrible conclusion of the trilogy. The first two were great comic/cartoon adaptations. But back in time? What the hell is that about?
Many fans who grew up with Clerks may be ready for a dark and gritty Clerks III&#46; Those who just want to check in with Dante and Randal&#44; be warned&#46; Jay and Silent Bob Reboot is the funnier and more uplifting legacy sequel&#46;
"[Saulnier's] biggest flaw is in storytelling: You can understand a thriller like this not wanting to get bogged down in details, but that doesn't mean you can just ignore them."
"Where the original Unfriended had a villain who was driven to murder by the slightly doofy motivation of ""teen humiliation,"" the villains in Unfriended: Dark Web aren't motivated by anything at all."
"When the high point of your movie involves a Queen Elizabeth lookalike getting down to a Euro-pop version of Edwin Starr's 'War,' something has gone disastrously wrong."
"A bland and painfully unnecessary sequel. Of all the directions they could have taken, this is what they chose to do with the turkey baster nightmare villain."
"Joker doesn't understand its representation of violence because it doesn't know what to do with its politics, opting instead for a confused aestheticization of anarchy, all incendiary chants and masked malcontents thronging the streets."
"Blade:Trinity gives us front row seats to watch the end of Wesley's career and the career of Parker ""Former Indie Queen"" Posey."
"By showing too much in an unfocused manner, the grounded reality of the Blair Witch legend is peeled back to reveal the very obvious paranormal story at its heart, making the sequel a dull and listless venture to sit through."
"What's intended to be a daring look at repressed sexuality, three-ways and all, has the dramatic heft of a true-love comic book."
This chapter leaves me little enthused for the future.
"Hanks fans may very well love this movie, but it does not fulfill its promise."
"Although it has interpreters with enough solvency, the excessive ethical discussion becomes tiring. [Full review in Spanish]"
"unnecessary exposition delivered with the pummeling speed of a tennis ball machine, colliding logic, lack of consequence for momentous setbacks and a sense of inevitability...make J.J. Abrams' capper to the original saga a disappointment."
"The ham-fisted dialogue saps the energy from the images, drawing attention to the thinness of archetypal characters. And the centrality of white characters who learn from a noble native undermines the film's attempts at political relevance."
"It's a perfectly respectable version of a tale told too many times, but it offers nothing fresh or new to the re-telling."
Man on a Ledge made me think of an old Van Halen song: Jump.
"I do have to give this movie credit, there's a lot of greatness...but it did bug me, I'm getting tired of people seeing our misery as what moves them..."
"""The Man Who Knew Infinity,"" based on Kanigel's book, and directed by Matthew Brown, feels sluggish and stuck, and it hits an insoluble crux."
"The movie shoots itself not only in the foot but in the bleeding heart as well, offering a series of (mostly predictable) plot twists that undermine every point that Parker and his posse were trying to make."
This is really a B-movie posing as an A-movie and I do not buy it.
"Much to admire and enjoy, but what could have been a meaningful parable about individual freedoms comes off as heavy-handed politicizing that doesn't quite add up."
"As exciting as they are, the action sequences still never pick up enough dramatic momentum to make us care."
"It may be a prize winner, but Teacher is a bomb."
"A pleasantly lousy movie that some people, if they look at the screen and squint really hard, might mistake for something decent."
There's nothing friendly about this joyless and repellently melodramatic family film.
It is not possible to organize the complexities of modern life in the pauper's bowl of empty moral abstraction and neo-mysticism in an artistically or intellectually satisfying manner.
Nancy is just too generically conceived to represent anything more than moviedom's latest damsel in distress.
"While it is both naive and unfair to expect lightning to strike terrain this fertile twice, the most distressing thing about the reloading of The Matrix is just how much it feels like The Phantom Menace."
"Even with effective individual scenes, Silent Night fails to launch; it sets out to deceive its audience, but only really ends up deceiving itself."
"A tedious, impenetrable cat-and-mouse game involving Russian double and triple agents."
As feverishly determined a work of enigma as I've ever seen.
You would probably be better off watching an episode of The X-Files instead . . .
As an interviewer Walker is habitually condescending and sometimes downright inane...
"There are a host of other things wrong with the film, from poor pacing, to a lack of character depth, to heavy-handed themes...but Jones does her best with what she has to work with, and it may still strike an emotional chord if they don’t look closely."
"Has the lazy, bric-a-brac atmosphere of one of those blown-off movies made during down time on some bigger affair."
Limp.
...what begins as a commentary on the depths grief can plunge you and what lengths you would go to dig yourself out turns into a seen-it-a-million-times action movie with a logic-deprived plot and a hero who is a stranger.
The overfamiliar Open Season feels like just another CG 'toon in our 'toon-glutted times.
Amazingly enough Rush Hour 3 is as instantly forgettable as Rush Hour 1 and 2.
Shifts into a blend of infidelity farce and domestic-strife melodrama that never quite finds an organic middle ground.
"For a supernatural Western about a hardened bounty hunter who comes back from the dead to take revenge, everything about this film is rather restrained."
"[Reaches] depths of laughable awfulness that can be appreciated, for their veritable badness as well as their campiness, only by True Fans."
"Through it all, the film never comes up with a way to convince us Murray's behavior has any internal logic."
"Sure, Steve Coogan has his hilarious moments as a delusional drama coach struggling to save the arts program at a Tucson, Ariz., high school, but that's all there is in the movie: moments."
"The Prince of Pennyslania, which strives for droll, idiosyncratic humor, is in its own way as narrow and limited as the small-town life it means to skewer."
"From the perfect family home movies that open the film, to its unconvincing 'urban' settings, Death Sentence is one-dimensional, cliched."
"The Shawshank Redemption continually abandons plausibility in order to celebrate the triumph of hope over despair, of decency over cruelty, of justice over injustice."
"No matter what kind of drab, derivative fluff you prefer, this exceptionally toothless comedy has something to offer."
"The film introduces too many elements, doubles back on itself, repeats and repeats the same information, starts and stops, includes needless tangential riffs, finds artificial means to stretch the running length and is in every way a flabby mess."
"Here is no cross-section of the eighteenth century which might have been such grand material for movie. The film is founded on the superficial appearance of men and things, an approach that has never and can never achieve the level of greatness."
"Ultimately the main character's journey seems small and somewhat unconvincing. Verbinski and screenwriter Steven Conrad don't need to give us a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down, but it'd be nice if the tonic was actually of some benefit."
He will not ride again.
"Ramis keeps the action moving at a good pace, but his film lacks the manic menace of Fargo."
Every so often a movie comes along that's bad in such original and unexpected ways that it inspires an almost admiring fascination.
"Depp cuts a haunting figure, while Wiest is typically excellent. The rest of the actors are forced to play characters who are either underdeveloped or overcooked, and the broadness of Burton's approach eventually leads to a wholly unsatisfying resolution."
"Theme is all-powerful, with characters verbally fondling their histories and identities - and, in one typically po-faced scene, intellectualising vomit."
...merely a good ending in search of a proper build-up.
Mostly the film morphs into a block of dullness.
"Myers -- who used to be funny -- sticks his head in a toilet and then tries to give the audience a big, sloppy kiss."
"mawkish, unfocused"
The cast is energetic but the talent is amateurish and the script is dead on arrival.
"The first time around, The Flintstones' visuals are a light-hearted kick, but there's nothing more to do."
"It's faithful to a fault; like its source, it's overstuffed with ideas and incidents and colorful and often distasteful digressions."
The f-bomb isn&apos;t just used&#44; it is part of McCarthy&apos;s character&apos;s breathing process&#46; Frankly&#44; after the 38th f-you&#44; it had gone beyond boring&#46;
"The trite scripting and direction are accessorised with dismaying invocations of Culture, lest we mistake Sal and Dean for mere wastrels with wanderlust."
"Were it not for the horses, the script as filmed could easily be performed on the stage as a three-act play."
"Unfortunately, this astrology-themed showcase of challenged love between a female cynic and male poetic spirit loses its mushy translation in the cosmos."
"Sparks' core formula: damaged hearts, pretty people, a body of water, the a small town community, a sad death, and a letter, plus a twist that feels desperate."
"Though Malick has a knack for enhancing the mood of each scene with stunning visual effects, it's not enough to boost the film."
"There's a lot of good material here, but there's also a lot of redundancy and unsuccessful crudeness accompanying it."
"[An] inept, studiously naive, childishly sanctimonious phantasmagoria ""inspired"" by the Beatles' great album."
Sunflower plays less like the epic it aspires to be than an episode of Full House: Beijing.
A music box trying to pass itself off as an orchestra.
Add another name to the long line of disappointing sequels to horror/comedy gems.
The old convention says that a critic should judge a film in relation to what it sets out to achieve. But there must be a point where a film sets out to achieve so little that the guideline ceases to be useful.
"A one-joke conceit that can't sustain itself over feature length, a good idea drowned in a sea of crudity and ineptitude. You'll leave it feeling more hung over than Willie."
"Ruined by Hendler's pointlessly artsy direction, a stab at postmodern snarkiness and an unconscionable 101-minute running time."
"Unnecessary back story, toilet humor, and overlong gags involving gore, yes, this is a sequel to ""Hatchet"" alright!"
"Has my heart grown so cold and battle-scarred that I can't allow myself to be completely won over by Flipped, or is Flipped such a load of flavorless mush that there's not enough charm for me to embrace?"
"Muddled and confusing; you need a scorecard and history book to separate the players and who belongs to what faction. Some nice sequences, though, almost compensate for the shortcomings."
"Earnest to a tee—and, frequently, to a fault—it’s a drama about the magic of the movies that itself is far too often lacking in that department."
"Borrows so heavily from the corpus of J-horror flicks, and especially Hideo Nakata's, that it should really be titled The Ring Tone."
So somebody finally got De Niro and Pacino to co-star in a movie together and this is the best they could come up with?
"Michael Bay and Tony Scott made love to the American flag, birthed a demon spawn and called it Battle Los Angeles."
"Less a reason to celebr8te than might have been, even in Ultra Panavision 70(mm)."
"The only actor who outshines his predecessor is Schreiber, a criminally underrated actor who thoroughly sells both Raymond's public allure and private confusion."
While director Francis Lawrence&#8217;s Slumberland takes inspiration from the comic&#44; it fails to capture the whimsy and delight of its origins&#46;&#10;&#10;
... copious amounts of hammy overacting and talk of gods and realms detract from what may have made a slick thriller.
A minor curiosity.
"Moreau and Palud decide to trade in the creepy, atmospheric style of the Pang Brothers for a more amped up Hollywood approach...it fails to distinguish itself either as a remake or on its own terms as a horror film."
"Recognizable as only déjà vu, and dismissed just as quickly, pretty much summarizes the newest installment in the interminable Men in Black franchise."
It's the Wayans' reluctance to upset anyone that misses colliding class and value differences into real hilarity.
The new players can't generate the grimy elan of the old film.
"I kind of feel the same way about the Aristocats as I felt about Fun, Fancy and Free. Both felt very lazy and derivative of better films."
The jokes are staler than day-old Fancy Feast.
"It's as though each character's life was pre-determined to be dreary, and adding ghosts into the mix is merely beating a dead horse."
"Ludicrously obsessed with sex to often laughable extremes, it's the rare film that can be described as ""horny."""
The laughs are so far apart and offer so few comic calories that it might be time to stick a fork in the franchise.
"The irony is, it's a journey with no escape."
"Duris, capable and dull, is no Keitel, 2005 is no 1978, and The Beat That My Heart Skipped is no Fingers."
Boring is the deal.
"Problems are evident, and eminent, from a black-and-white flashback prologue in which four young men speak with old actors' voices. Yes, a man purportedly in peak physical condition sounds like a 70-year-old who's eaten bags of gravel daily for 30 years."
The Shadow seeks to be another Batman. It is more likely to be another Doc Savage or Flash Gordon - both lackluster attempts to translate past pulp heroes into big-screen money.
"There are a few very funny moments in this thankfully short 77 minutes, but nowhere near enough ideas or gags to sustain a feature-length version of this TV show."
"So much is stuck in a proscenium: in its editing, in its music, in the greys that drown every scene. In the end, little feels discovered. It feels lectured."
"This isn't so much a document of a certain group of people's lives, but a political tool, Democratic through-and-through."
The pretentious psychological thriller has nothing worth saying about the American criminal justice system.
"The chief culprits are a laboured, poorly structured script by Aussie John Collee; the hackneyed device of having Darwin interact with the ghost of his dead daughter; and Jon Amiel's heavy-handed direction."
"Seems to beg for a 'used' label, not primarily because it's based on an old TV show, but because it stubbornly embraces the tired tropes of every dumb action movie Hollywood's ever made."
Medieval history lesson with lots of shattered bodies and splattered limbs.
Underwhelming.
"Decadence has rarely looked so pathetic, lethargic and dispiriting as it does in this listless film."
"Much like the self-help guru it enables, it exists solely to get your money like a good little follower and then ask you to ignore the doubt that comes with having plunked down exorbitant theater prices for a barely average comedy."
"In Drillbit Taylor, produced by Judd Apatow, co-written by Seth Rogen and Kristofor Brown, and starring Owen Wilson, the career trajectories of three comic talents converge to dispiriting effect."
"It's a PG rated mediocrity that, instead of aiming to be hilarious, aims to be ""nice."""
Crowe's capable of much better than this; let's hope he gets back on track with the next one.
It's a videogame adaptation that loses sight of what made the game popular to begin with: it was fun.
"Candis doesn't trust his himself to pull it off, weighing the film down with a disconnected score that pushes an otherwise edgy story into melodrama."
Poor Affleck mostly hangs in the background while Hunnam and Hedlund do their weird flexing. Ben Affleck ends up being the least-grating actor in the ensemble.
"Beautifully, atmospherically shot and sporting a great soundtrack, this is an otherwise quite dull affair."
"...a lazy girl-on-girl courtship comedy that never accomplishes the daring commentary it only flirts at with benign, banal results. Atmospheric and excursively derivative, Kissing keeps one's lips sealed without much forethought"
It gets down the road predictably and by the numbers...
Here's one Diesel-fueled vehicle that's neither fast nor furious.
"Even with a brief 85-minute running time, The Return feels padded, which is odd considering how little we're told about the characters or the central mystery."
It seemed like it would be an exciting John Wick-style vehicle for Taraji P. Henson but it ended up being a complete misfire that does a disservice to her talents.
It's a film for people whose brains have been permanently muted.
This film is as tediously pleased with itself as it is deeply unfunny. 
A roughhouse between the Hayes's dingbatty script...and director Sera's winking and surprisingly skillful treatment of it...ultimately disappointing.
commendable for its ambition&#44; although said ambition is relentlessly stretched to the breaking point by shoddy plotting&#44; confusing characters&#44; and a general lack of focus
"Romero is -- on paper, anyway -- an ideal director for a comic-book movie... [But] the mechanics of storytelling bog him down, and most of the time the formal style of Creepshow has him in a straitjacket."
You don't want to be any of these b*******.
"Talented actors are wasted in a film that induces more cringes than chuckles as women old enough to know better act like horny sailors on leave, absorb mass quantities of alcohol and drugs, and generally behave horribly."
"The fight scenes are, well, punishing, well-staged but so brutal that they throw the thin plot out of balance."
Loony and laughable...There's something outlandish about Besson trying to infuse ideas into his usual jumble of over-the-top action and comic-book violence.
Better than its juvenile predecessor.
"A pay-for-admission commercial for its own empire, it stretches the definition of a movie into something so ugly as to be unidentifiable"
"Southpaw asks both too much of Gyllenhaal and not enough - he's being forced to build a whole character out of scraps, sawdust, and horrendous clichés."
"Johnson’s career has become so meticulously engineered and marketed that even his brooding, murderous DC antihero can only cause Teflon mayhem."
"The very definition of harmless, watchable entertainment. Exactly whether or not that is good enough depends on who you are."
"If you ever wanted to see a wartime movie that feels directed by a kinder, gentler Michael Bay, Come What May is right up your alley."
The unchanneled energy of Robin Williams can't redeem this messy yarn.
"It shouldn't happen to anyone, much less a Dame - not a movie of such barreling awfulness that it strands the great Helen Mirren in a gothic house of cards that collapses on actors and audiences alike."
"A bland, forgettable, and sub-par teen marketed horror cash-in that bored me to tears..."
"The nicest thing I can think of to say about the doc ""Neil Young Journeys"" is that at least it isn't in 3-D."
"Destricted is good for a few inadvertent laughs, but as a sociological statement on human sexuality, it's practically worthless."
"Director Pablo Larrain clearly wishes neither to sentimentalise the past, nor excoriate it with cynical satire; but this trepidation leaves his film feeling indecisive."
12 Strong winds up being an almost-good film about some great American soldiers.
Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters feels like a sequel no one asked for and took said sentiment to heart.
An uninvolving muddle.
"Aimed at adults more than kids, this animated feature is only intermittently funny, skewering sibling rivalry."
Brutally disappointing.
"The more we discover about the threat that faces them, the more risible this derivative horror yarn becomes."
The last time I heard a film audience in such a state of silence was during Ingmar Bergman's Winter Light.
"It's a boondoggle we probably should have seen coming. But maybe we can all be forgiven for some desperate magical thinking during our long time of confinement, gazing outside and looking for something, anything, that might make life a bit more exciting."
"For those who have never been high, the new film ""Inherent Vice"" will give you a pretty good sense of it. You'll have no idea what's going on. You'll wonder whether you're supposed to know. In the end, though, you won't be sure you care."
"Vincenzo Natali emphasizes technically impressive shots in the service of predictable, boring expository beats, at the expense of elaborating on his main character's growing feelings of isolation and torment."
"As for wit, the only amusing aspect about The 5th Wave is that it ends as if there will be a sequel. That would really finish off mankind."
The idea is cartoonish in its essence but the pic is shot and played with such straight-faced realism that Swallow becomes utterly ridiculous.
"The legend of Doug ""The Thug"" Glatt continues in Goon: Last Of The Enforcers -- though honestly, maybe it shouldn't have."
"It put me to sleep -- and Harris's constant, nagging voice over makes you want to tape your ears shut."
The references weren't enough to hold a movie. Would I recommend it to someone else? Most likely not...
"The result is two bad movies in one: a gimmicky romantic comedy, and one of those seasonal headaches that submits loud family dysfunction as a vehicle for Christmas cheer."
"It's as if one of those conservative parents' groups who edit movies to release them on video got a whack at this one before it hit the multiplex. Oddly enough, the very audience ""Pants"" panders to so strongly may have already outgrown it."
"Silent Hill starts out promisingly -- atmospheric and creepy -- but degenerates into a muddle of nonsensical plotting, dull characters and unintentional hilarity."
Repo Men is a rare film where Toronto plays itself. It's also the first I've ever seen where a typewriter is used as a lethal weapon.
"Youth is wasted on the young, and apparently time machines are as well."
"Despite some snappy ideas (an aggressive advertising drone pushing products as answers to the family’s every problem), “Bigbug” is overdressed, overlong and diminishingly amusing."
This is what happens when you combine THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS with SHREK. It should have been called DRECK!
"At times it is as if JONAH HEX was shot twice, and the editors could not decide which pieces to use, so they intercut both of them."
"Someone make it stop. Jason Blum, have you no pity?"
Isn't it bad? Isn't it poor? Yes.
An asinine&#44; preposterous and silly thriller with a lazy twist that&apos;s worse than M&#46; Night Shyamalan lame twists&#46; You&apos;ll feeling hanging-up long before someone says the cringe-inducing line&#44; &quot;Elvis has left the building&#46;&quot;
A cheaper&#44; chintzier version of this movie might have been as much fun as these actors appear to be having&#46;
The sequel's a caricatured and clichd yawner. And the tone is all wrong.
"'Ejemplo de una cinta en que no importa el talento de su reparto o lo interesante que pudo haber resultado su premisa, pues el resultado es francamente aburrido y, por momentos, deplorable.'"
"The twist is pretty great -- and really out there. The rest of the movie, not so much."
"A diverting, though far-from-exceptional slice or art cinema, the film seems to be feigning profundity, and there's only a limited amount of enjoyment in playing along before the film seems to run dry."
Parental Content Review
"Hauer is OK as Bruegel, but Charlotte Rampling is weird as the painting's Virgin Mary and, in a mostly non-verbal story, she's burdened by some excruciatingly gushy voiceovers ."
"(S)tories should show, not tell, and Nolan keeps telling us that he can't tell this story."
the fairly predictable cornball fluff we anticipate when off-center loners find a middle ground.
"The Scorch Trials wanders between YA cliches - there's a Resistance, but it's unclear what they're resisting - and zombie movie tropes, with the obligatory a zombie bit our friend scene."
There's no doubt the real Sully is a good dude who did a good thing. There's also no doubt that good dudes doing good things don't always make for good movies.
... the incessant references to Gandhi keep gumming up the class-war love story.
I think it's very ordinary.
Whatever it was that made the first film work is really lacking here.
It's actually kind of depressing to watch good actors wasted in this fashion.
"An almost impenetrable slog of pulp sci-fi notions of intergalactic wars and an amnesiac supersoldier, expressed without a modicum of camp or passion."
"The way Techine holds them up to the film's unforgiving light, they sometimes seem less like people than like insects in a jar."
"The ""Divergent"" series wasn't strong to begin with but this latest entry reaches a new low point."
The Art of War becomes a convoluted yarn of international conspiracies thinner than the paper the script is printed on.
"Ciro Guerra's Waiting for the Barbarians is a misguidedly straight-faced bore, a literary adaptation that fails to find the story in the text."
"""Jinn"" is certainly not lacking in audacity, but its uneasy balance between inspired delirium and mundane genre dues-paying is its one bridge too far."
The kind of misfire that only talented people could make&#46; 
Completely straw-manned...the movie spends two hours screwing around...don't pay to see it.
Pretentious best describes the 184-minute movie: every scene is filled with expectations of the highest form of expression but none succeed.
"Doesn't bode well for Cook's movie career, and it's just another in a line of feature comedies that wouldn't cut it even as television sitcoms."
"Disgusting. It's a straight-faced argument in favor of macho posturing and workplace violence, with little to no laughs (Splice Today)"
This is a witless attempt at bro-comedy that's been mined so much better in other films.
"Another assembly-line Hollywood blockbuster, a Western for people who have never seen Westerns, and a science-fiction movie for people who don't like science fiction."
A letdown for those who were hoping for so much after George Washington.
"Easily the best thing Eastwood has done in years, though that's not exactly praise considering the director's recent years include such turgid duds like Gran Torino, Invictus and Hereafter."
"Weber is about as far from Don Juan as I can imagine, and he comes across as an overgrown, geriatric, hairy monster"
"Despite a sympathetic performance from Sex and the City star Kim Cattrall, there simply isn't much life or surprise in this tepid indie."
"This is a stilted, dreary film -- and pretty derivative."
...close-up brawls pack much-needed heat in a film that otherwise lacks zest and self-awareness.
"Oh, no."
This movie is a slog.
A Reject Indeed. Zombie horror film unwatchable.
"The script is an episodic and disjointed mess that never generates any tension or dread, so the only scares are of the very fleeting something-jumps-out-of-the-shadows kind. We've seen it all done before, better and far more inventively."
A naive and self-indulgent piece with very little going for it other than zeitgeist bragging rights.
Opens with an explosion - of platitudes
"In time this would-be thriller comes to rest with a fist fight, a hanging ending and the implicit promise of a sequel. Of all the calamities that Fanning predicts, Push 2 is one she missed."
"For all the sound, fury and spectacle, the film feels vaguely hollow and unsatisfying."
A disappointment.
Lukewarm dramedy is OK for teens but lacks power.
"It's not the worst film to come from a 'Saturday Night Live' alum that left that show too soon to pursue their movie career, but it's far from the best."
"It's never a good sign when the supporting cast is the most interesting thing about your movie, but when your supporting cast is almost the entire cast of Bridesmaids (minus Melissa McCarthy), it's almost inevitable."
The movie threatens to become a sketch about a coquette and a boor squabbling at each other to little effect.
"While it builds palpable tension early on, No One Lives de-evolves into a generic torture porn gorefest in its second half, becoming increasingly absurd as it does so"
"An embarrassingly cliché action flick that has no memorable characters and an extremely derivative story ... If you prefer action movies with people who have actual personalities and a compelling plot, then don't waste your time with The Prey."
I Love Trouble is a perfect example of a truly lightweight motion picture.
"What starts as a playful cat and mouse game of deception, rapidly loses its way, morphing into an unbelievable, convoluted and dark tale of revenge."
"A great film on this disturbing subject deserves to be made, but Hard Candy is way too soft."
"It's basically one long training montage, from about ten minutes in until ten minutes from the end."
Is it possible to get mad at a film that has its heart and soul in the right place?
"Gunpowder Milkshake does its formidable cast dirty with a bland script, recycled story, and an empty comic book style that does little but shine up a stale outing."
Poorly conceived and executed.
Perhaps it's only just that a movie about a loser should be a loser itself.
...more melodramatic than meaningful. It's a well-intentioned piece that nonetheless is a true snooze.
"An annoying one-two-three punch of crappy acting, shoddy scriptwriting, and poor direction."
"Such moments, as movie-engineered as they seem, are enhanced considerably by Linney and Grace's completely lived-in performances."
"Flat dialogue, overly long scenes, and a too-hazy story make The Ninth Gate a near-complete letdown."
"It's downright terrible at times. However, it's not nearly as awful as his two features that came out last year."
A shockingly routine film.
"The Dead Don't Die feels like some sort of cinematic end-of-the-world apocalypse. If the auteur responsible for such gems as Stranger Than Paradise, Mystery Train and Only Lovers Left Alive has resorted to making movies this bad, then we're all doomed."
An innovative idea marred by poor execution.
"Nothing that happens in Greenland is all that surprising, including the poor and shrewdly opportunist ways people react under pressure."
"Roman Polanski (The Pianist, Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown) is unquestionably a great filmmaker, but as Marina Zenovich's documentary Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired perhaps unintentionally demonstrates, he's also a creep."
"All the hand-wringing tech paranoia is merely an excuse for a microversion of Babel-like melodrama, one in which the loosely interwoven stories, regrettably, never add up to the sum of their parts."
A film that smacks more of the coffee table than the operating table.
"Style over substance doesn't really tell the half of it: you can bathe a corpse in groovy light and dress it in an expensive suit, but in the end that rotting smell just won't go away."
It is simply a series of ugly and bloody episodes strung together one after another like a demo tape by a perverted special-effects man.
"Scalpello and screenwriter Nick Moorcroft take the lowest common denominator route, falling back on tired mob-movie clichés, stock characters and leaden dialogue so generic it could have been written by an algorithm."
Good riddance.
"Retro visual flair, such as repeat cuts and mirror effects, add some aesthetic interest to Jo’s spiraling. But “Baby Ruby” hardly whimpers, let alone screams."
Even the mightiest auteurist would flail about trying to find a reason [Clint Eastwood] accepted the job in the first place.
"The stereotyping of Black and Indigenous men are made worse by the fact they never speak, nor do they have any backstories."
"The film, directed and written by Richardson, is funnier than expected, which is not to say that it is as funny as it ought to be, mainly because Lamar Pellay is less disaffected than affected."
"Hardy rises to the challenge of the format, yet the film fails to generate much suspense or sympathy."
If only audiences could stop the horrors by shouting RED! at the screen.
"Glossy, flossy and blithely secure in its own cheerfully fake worldview, ""Baggage Claim"" bypasses the intellect entirely, happy to satisfy on a silly, screwball, wish-fulfillment level."
Never lives up to its magnificent opening sequence.
Suggests a third-rate Masterpiece Theatre production that got lost on its way to PBS.
"This utterly toothless, glorified Hallmark movie for Paramount+ proves the director is only as good as his material."
What starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points.
"Plays like one of those conversations that Comic Book Guy on ""The Simpsons"" has."
"""44 Pages"" winds up feeling like an infomercial for ""Highlights,"" something new employees would watch on their first day at the office."
"It's still an old-school superhero summer movie, the plotting tortuous, the characters relegated to one-scene-one-emotion simplicity, the digitized action a never ending club mix of chases and mano a manos."
"The real weak point is Reiner's listless direction, with too few scenes that almost gel and too many that fall flat."
"Although this is potentially juicy stuff, it is as dry and tasteless as a shrunken piece of fruit left in the refrigerator far too long."
The only thing that death is coming for is the Rambo franchise itself
"The best way to enjoy ""Mars Needs Moms""? Skip the movie and watch the closing credits."
It was only a matter of time before [Larry] got his own critic-proof movie.
"The first project of the here! gay television network's new movie initiative, Shelter regrettably plays closer to Lifetime fodder."
"By the time the final utterly idiotic twist arrives, you'll be screaming for your time back and angry with what seems to be an otherwise talented cast and crew, Jason Blum included, for tricking you into watching such nonsense."
"Although the movie deals with important issues surrounding the devastations of grief, it strains for metaphorical significance at nearly every turn, even as it tries to temper its seriousness with offbeat expressions of humor."
...the only good thing is that we know it will end. [Full Review in Spanish]
"A one-sided polemic....If the history of this debate is any indication,...it will merely confirm Wakefield's followers in their views while vexing their detractors (if you'll excuse the pun)."
"...the plot is practically a remake of The Karate Kid. That may be sufficiently long ago that the target audience of teens won't notice, but it's pretty blatant."
Predictable&#44; unfunny&#44; and offensive&#44; this spin-off from the British sketch show The Catherine Tate Show is a soul-sucking experience&#46;
"A decidedly less exciting popcorn movie that tries to mix Indiana Jones, The Da Vinci Code and several strands of conspiracy theory in one blandly entertaining package."
Bewitched will not cast you under its spell. It is more likely to bother and bewilder.
The cheesiness so endemic to the Star Trek franchise ... is back in full force.
"I sorta enjoyed myself. I could have done without the scene where he floats in anguished reverie, making Hamlet sound like an extrovert."
Will anyone finally escape this floating slaughterhouse? Do you even care?
I just wish the movie would sit still long enough so you could get invested.
"While it does present a series of stirring images of the Red Planet, far too much of the film's already brief (40-minute) running time is consumed by shots of anxious-looking scientists and engineers peering intently at their computer monitors."
A tottering costume drama that gave Bette Davis one of her rare non-bitchy roles. It should come as little surprise that it doesn't quite work.
"Part music documentary, part absurdist comedy, part existential drama, The Nowhere Inn never quite succeeds at any of those."
"A half-hour into the film, and it feels like the eighth day of jury duty."
"For reasons that never become apparent, Jordan elects to play the growing mayhem straight, and the movie drags its toneless, spiritless way to the edifying conclusion that there is 'no peace anywhere.' How true. How banal."
Book Club made me want to give up reading altogether&#46;
...doesn't seem particularly interested in the nuances and points of frisson that are bound to occur when East meets West.
The results are only slightly better than coal in your stocking.
"Hitman: Agent 47 has enjoyable action, paper-thin characters, and an incomprehensible plot. Well, one out of three ain't bad."
"Barely 70 minutes, but any more of her routine might drive audiences either to the showers or to church."
One of the worst action movies of the '90s.
What I really hate is that there are moments in Avatar&#58; The Way of Water when you get a glimpse at the special film it could have become&#46;
"Soft & Quiet is not a film for the faint of heart, and might just leave you a bit shell-shocked in the aftermath."
A creepy and deliberately paced thriller that is effective in its unpleasantness ...
"Some mildly amusing ideas shouldn't be full-length feature films, and The Happytime Murders falls victim to that."
"Director Adam Robitel tries to hard sell the tried and tested concept with a brand-new packaging, which soon wears thin."
"'All in all, Reign of Fire will be a good (successful) rental.'"
"It's more than occasionally cute, if less than consistently clever."
"My reaction to this movie is mixed, at best."
"A by-the-numbers biopic that does a disservice to its star and subject, and sorely missing a killer soundtrack. Watch The Man Who Fell To Earth instead."
"The closer Cohen rams the camera to his pummeling actors, the more you don't know what's actually transpiring."
Duller than a Monday night at the cobweb museum...
Anne Hathaway is so great you almost feel badly having to criticize what surrounds her.
"This rehash of the 1981 comedy seems particularly ill-timed, as it's no longer fun to laugh at irresponsible drunks, especially when they're billionaires"
"Then things get even more peculiar, in a film that received exuberant plaudits following its limited cinema release last month but which, despite the quality of the acting, I'm afraid I found almost unendurably grim."
"Stella comes straight from the 'designer problems' school of screenwriting, a genre in which stories are built around wealthy, gorgeous people who have to create their own miseries in order for anything remotely dramatic to occur."
"It seems [Whedon] was willing to tell the story at all costs, regardless of faults within the narrative and the universe."
"Even with Smith's ability to sell austere grief, Collateral Beauty never quite validates itself as a story that deserves this performance."
BloodRayne is scary rubbish. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Even though director-adaptor Mary McGuckian expended much creative energy trying to pump original spirit into the characters, she never brings any of them to life."
There's a story hidden underneath all this incessant riffing that could have made a poignant statement about modern politics and celebrity if the movie had dared to actually follow it through.
"Mildly amusing, but hardly fabulous and awfully long."
[A] clumsy bit of preposterousness.
"Resolutely somber, and self-aware about its deliberately tight and opaque visual style, it's presentational more than lived, a series of filmmaking choices instead of something deeply felt and conveyed."
All of this is pleasant enough -- and utterly unbelievable.
"As an adaptation, it's a disappointment. As Hollywood fare, it's a bust."
"By no means totally broken, but it doesn't quite deliver the way it could."
&#65279;All this is admirable. I just wish Sayles would also put a little movie into the movie.
"The new Dumbo is not blatantly bad; rather, it's a mostly bland affair that doesn't justify the effort it took to remake the film. The story moves away from being solely Dumbo's journey, and the emotions that removes can't be replaced."
"May errs, however, in styling this human interest saga."
Questions of predestination and free will are intriguingly posed and clunkily answered in The Adjustment Bureau.
"This long, slow, boring, talky film is a vindictive calumny, making up things out of whole cloth, not a paean to a great man who almost singlehandedly stood up and opposed Hitler when it looked like all was lost. It is shameful with no raison d'tre."
The acting and scripting are too uneven for either the drama or the comedy to gather much steam.
Jonathan Liebesman's prequel to Tobe Hooper's 1974 horror classic is just another trip down a very dusty road.
"Very fine actors completely wasted in a poorly made reboot. Oh, the boredom! [Full review in Spanish]"
"More puzzling than it is unwatchable, squandering some really quite exceptional moments under the weight of a dreary and dull tale."
"Instead of an insightful look at disaffected youths finding an outlet for angry energy in rock rages, American Hardcore is a slanted history lesson coming solely from its subjects."
I found myself wishing for a story less beholden to one we've seen brought to the screen so many times before.
"There's a lot of hand-to-hand action, just like a video game, that gets harder as you move up a level. Also, like a video game, there is no story. You have no idea who is fighting whom. Or why."
I just did not feel any chemistry between our leads...
It just never quite connects in the way fans of this legendary character hope it would.
It&#8217;s average and serviceable&#44; and it lacks any kind of spark or creativity that would make it memorable in a meaningful way&#46;
"It's sluggishness that keeps ""Cezanne et moi"" chained to the floor more often than not, limiting its educational ambition to periodic illumination over two very long hours."
"Always worth seeing these two actors, but not necessarily in this movie."
The bits never add up to anything resembling a satisfying whole and while you keep expecting a film with a cast of this caliber to eventually pull a rabbit or two out of thin air.
Calling it a broad comedy would be like fat-shaming an entire genre.
The title suggests that Jeanne's [Isild Le Bresco] mixed breed puts her in that Indian sect but nothing happens to her because of this pariah.
Neither clever nor stupid enough to work.
"Easily Meyer's most insane bit of over the top and giddily silly prose, the basic truth is not a heck of a lot happens here."
"Gretel & Hansel is a full course meal when it comes to cinematography and production design, but the sleepy, hollow narrative pacing is just too stogy to overcome."
"It would be too much to say that there's a good movie somewhere inside Smurfs 2 looking to get out. But it wouldn't be too much to say that sometimes, the movie we do have tries harder than we might expect."
"A disappointing messy instalment, this combination of battle scenes and soap-opera marks an extraordinary achievement - the completion of a 20 year journey in Middle-earth by Peter Jackson"
The impoverished story line and murky amber tone make for a slightly depressing experience.
"Part comedy, part drama, the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full, and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas, but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole."
"You remember the first shots, and the last, but the film never really finds its footing."
"After looking forward to it for so long, it's hard not to feel let down about the film's lack of imagination."
"The original show is such a simple, robust conceit that there was plenty of space and opportunity to do a contemporary reboot, but this Fantasy Island is no narrative dream destination."
"A breezy dramedy that delivers some laughs at the beginning, Jawaani Jaanmen is let down by a tired script that doesn't deliver enough of an emotional punch at the end."
Year One is little more than Religulous with fart jokes.
This half-baked chiller disintegrates in a nonsensical finale that makes you want to slap your forehead in disgust. It's really too bad since Norton gives such a tremendously calculated performance and other individual elements work so well.
"By reducing all the issues down to a case of copulation, albeit set against a backdrop both sumptuous and superficial, Fontaine turns her intentions laughable."
"This mildly enjoyable romantic comedy is a step in the right direction for star (and producer) Katherine Heigl, who enjoys nice rapport with Josh Duhamel, but the writing is too formulaic and not fresh enough."
Their Finest is one of those films that makes the art of making movies feel too self-important.
"If this sounds like a knockoff of Se7en, that's because it is."
Too cluttered and manic to bring real pleasure.
If only the ticking clock were more tightly wound; if only more time were used to develop the romance and relationships; if only dying didn't seem so easy.
"The characters are self-involved, status-seeking and aggressive to the point of viciousness and it is perfectly in character for them to start offing each other for no good reason, which is clearly the point. But that point does not make it funny."
"Will drive one to distraction with its histrionic acting, multipronged approach to storytelling and infernal attempts at social commentary."
Red Sparrow gives the impression that Jennifer Lawrence needs to take a break to recharge her batteries.
An ugly beast of a movie as robotic as its main attractions that could justifiably become the symbol of all that is wrong with modern day summer spectaculars.
"While Roberts glows, she deserves more than this flimsy, underwritten part. The humdrum romance flunks out."
Sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary.
'Sucken.'
The movie doesn’t have enough of a narrative engine to compensate for its lack of world building.
That all its castration talk is prolonged to willfully torturous lengths could be forgiven were the film much more inspired in its interplay.
A well-intentioned candid melodrama about an unwed mother's plight.
"Quick, somebody give Kevin Spacey a bad guy role before he becomes as bland as Harrison Ford!"
Filme producto de la excesiva comercializacin que tuvo su predecesor
"What we have here is a household ripe with seduction, lust, betrayal and repression, all kept below the surface by increasingly strained good manners."
"The Pink Panther is like a pratfall that doesn't work. It should be funny, but it hurts more than it should."
... the Satanic panic mumbo jumbo is eye-rolling and most of the beats are extremely predictable.
"Its protagonists, their situation and its mechanical but mushy resolution are never remotely believable."
he issue here is that everything from the characterization to the film's visual sensibility feels derivative of these references without inviting much new conversation
"There's an audience out there for this kind of thing, but if this is what passes for funny, what in the world of comedy doesn't qualify?"
A mostly lumbering and largely dreary satire.
"For all the high-tech lingo, there's nothing new to feel or see."
Not even the master mirthmaker in Kasdan can save Dean or Mumford from bouts of mediocrity.
"Hall Pass boasts a couple of big laughs. For the most part though, our response to the script is weak smiles."
"Sandler's character never changes -- his arc goes from nice to nice, and there's no dramatic transformation."
Pretty and pretty amusing but wholly fake.
"Falls into that narrow crevice between cringe comedy and working-class drama. Then, deep underground, long out of the range of humour, it flails where no one can hear it, drawing scenes out into shapeless, squalid things."
A workmanlike but hardly scintillating mystery that spends more time and energy reintroducing characters from the show and trying to capture its original flavor than constructing a compelling narrative.
"The standard action sequences pile up, interspersed with Wolverine's mooning about in a funk because he's lost the will to live."
"It's nothing new to see a film that is better in concept than execution, or a film that wastes a talented cast. Sadly, The Reckoning does both."
"Even undemanding audiences will struggle to enjoy this, since it so stubbornly refuses to deliver either laughs or thrills."
Last Chance Harvey is the week's six-hankie offering. Imagine Richard Curtis remaking An Affair to Remember: maudlin amiability is the game's name.
"Sleight's greatest trick is hiding expected action for so long, only to capture attention through more familiar dramatic trappings."
If you don't walk out of the movie (as I was sorely tempted to do) you'll eventually get to meet the seven dwarfs... This touch of whimsy is welcome but comes too late to rescue the dark-hearted movie.
"""The United States vs. Billie Holiday"" is a misfire, and what a shame, because Andra Day had it in her to be great in this. The movie didn't let her bring it out."
"Barry Levinson's Man of the Year is a negligible and insipid film. If one takes a storyline ""from the headlines,"" one should do it with some depth or not bother at all."
"A generic, outdated action thriller with clunky dialogue, one-dimensional characters and mediocre action."
"A movie that feels like it came off an assembly line, which makes it that much stranger when it keeps attempting comedy. Aw, look, the widget has jokes!"
"Sadly, nothing in this thriller comes close to the intensity of last year's media coverage of star Ethan Hawke's alleged infidelities on location in Montreal."
I'm still not sure whether to mildly like or mildly hate this movie.
"Offers just a few moderately amusing moments, and by and large proves curiously flat, despite all the talent on the screen."
I felt like I came in at the middle of the movie. The aliens had taken over and the revolution had begun. And it all went downhill from there. BUT it is always good to see John Goodman and Vera Farmiga in a film.
"Novelist-turned-screenwriter Mark Poirier gives the capable, eclectic cast some real zingers to play with, but he also loads his script with some plot contrivances that are simply too hard to accept."
Mostly this movie swings and misses.
"This is not just scanning darkly, it's close to opaque."
"The original clocked in at a lean 76 minutes, but in the hands of Bay, a long-term advocate of the maxim “more is more”, the story is pumped up, steroidal and unwieldy."
"The only revelations in The Killing of John Lennon are those we could have picked up ourselves, assuming we cared enough to do so."
Lots more of the same isn't better.
"Strip away Rylance's vocal performance and the expensive effects and you have little more than two hours of precocious children, silly adults and corny gags."
"works well-enough as a CGI adventure aimed at the kiddies, but grownups will probably be indifferent to this otherwise average story that features some pretty cool monster effects, but not much else."
"If you want to see a movie with some real chops about gays in Argentina, rent Wong Kar Wai's still-hip, still-smoldering Happy Together from 1997, and happier you will be."
"...when an obvious Secret Service baddie shows up to nervously have a smoke with Banning (as Hans Gruber did with John McLean), it's hard not to burst out laughing at the sheer chutzpah of the lift."
Director Jimmy Hayward fails to establish a viable reason for this movie to exist.
...the familiarity of the storyline is rarely as problematic as one might've anticipated...
"Like most of the Rodgers-and-Hammerstcin musicals, this one probably is headed for success at the movie box-office, but in honest warmth and melodic appeal it compares weakly with its predecessors."
It's a feeble storyline and the film is only partially lifted by some lively action sequences and one or two Gravity-like scenes of the astronauts drifting in space.
PG-13 is not the arena this film should be fighting in.
"I was also told by a very disappointed fan of the novel that, other than the ending, this is a faithful adaptation. Unfortunately, a screenwriter’s fealty to the source material is often the kiss of death."
"Twenty minutes in, we know where the movie is going and, as a result, it loses momentum in the final half-hour."
"The movie never involves the viewer in the puzzle or riddle-solving process. The characters rush from clue to clue, and we just watch as they figure it out. It's a passive experience."
"The movie arrives at an eye-roll inducing final twist, and hints at an inevitable sequel. But this app isn't exactly begging for an upgrade."
"The performance sequences feel intimate and exhilarating -- but in the end, Li's journey is compelling only when he's onstage."
Here it is just a weak version of Hook and Paddington without either's whimsy and charm (especially compared to Paddington).
What starts out with a sense of quirky fun loses direction and devolves into a mishmash of story lines.
It's yo-ho-ho and a bottle of dumb!
This is one grim fairy tale.
A rambling assault on the visual cortex that teeters between guided meditation and guided tour.
This film reflects that its filmmakers only see in the smaller spectators a product not worth of quality plots. [Full review in Spanish]
"Far from being groundbreaking independent cinema, A Home feels like just another prefab production."
"It cultivates not the illusion of wholesomeness, since no one's buying it, but the pretense of it. Yet examine the movie's message, and it's pretty insidious."
"Prince Avalanche isn't quite the character study it seems to want to be. Green sometimes bobbles the tone and focus, lurching from deadpan comedy to self-indulgent navel-gazing to underplayed ghost story."
It's hard to think of how any two characters could be more self-absorbed and annoying.
"Vapid, disjointed drivel."
Emmerich mounts an all-out assault on the world and on quality filmmaking with this bloated disaster flick
"Dull turns to ludicrous, as action and plot twists fly at the audience from left field-- if not the bleachers."
An antiquated story with only one redeeming feature -- good production.
"Cage, dyed hair, beard and boots, brings home the B-movie bacon, as usual. It's just seriously undercooked this time out."
"Metal Lords plays out like a generic offspring born from a tryst between School of Rock, The Spectacular Now and every high-school movie featuring two childhood friends, a strange girl and a Battle of the Bands contest."
"Yet another needless 're-imagining' of a '70s cult fave that, truth to tell, is better remembered than actually viewed, Neil LaBute's folly follows the basic plot outline of the 1974 Brit horror opus of the same title."
"Muse is the perfect example of a plot that sounded good as an idea, but was never fully developed in the script. [Full review in Spanish]."
"If you've been waiting for The Raiders of the Lost Ark to be remade as a bad kung fu film, wait no longer."
"Bay directs Armageddon in a way that seems more concerned with constantly assaulting the senses than anything else, hoping perhaps that the quick cuts and constant explosions will distract from his film's many flaws."
"With all its overly dramatic head turns and frowny faces, the new Murder largely wastes its extremely impressive cast ..."
Sienna Miller lights up an otherwise mediocre recounting of the rise and fall of Andy Warhol muse Edie Sedgwick.
"Milla Jovovich is as amazing as you expect, but her participation in this style of films, which seem all the same, begins to tire. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Mutual loathing and eye-rolling sustain - horribly - many of the couples involved.
Clearly the best thing about Near Dark is that it gives jobs to three terrific actors who had supporting roles in Aliens... But Near Dark is so devoid of humanity or humor that it can't escape being an empty exercise in style.

This comedy starring and produced by Adam Sandler feels as slapped together one of the comedian's live-action buddy movies.
A tale of memory and redemption that does little to linger in the mind and even less to decry P.L. Travers's claim that Disney turns everything it touches into schmaltz.

Neither the myth nor the morals of this movie held together for me.

"... beneath the cultural color and Spanish exclamations, the dilemmas and conflicts that swirl around the family gatherings are just like the holidays in every such movie."
One hopes the entire process made for great couples therapy&#44; because watching it certainly doesn&#8217;t&#46;
The film has some cheap thrills ... but lacks more sustained tension.
"In short, there is little reason for it to exist since it doesn't move the series forward but rather backward to try and reinvigorate / update a 35 year-old franchise."

"After so many years of memorable horror villains, what's particularly terrifying about some dude with a neon-orange ski mask and a ratty camouflage jacket?"
I had more emotional investment in Yogi Bear. That's sad. And Yogi Bear wasted 36 minutes less of my time.

'My Zoe' is such a confused mess of pretension and anticlimax that it's hard to recommend as anything but a showcase of wasted potential.

The games it plays are more ambitious than successful.
Blandly staged and simply told.
The Rental is an interesting situational effort which would have benefitted from tighter storytelling and better characterization during its prolonged set-up.

Kids and parents deserve better than this.
"Business over ideas and exaggeration over technique, end up by configuring My Little Pony as a weak film. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Jack's problem is that he's a commoner, but the movie's problem is that its script is commoner still, an enchantment-free pretext for animated action, straight-ahead storytelling and ersatz romance."
There's no emotional eloquence.
"stumbles out of the gate, falls, and never rights itself. For the Halloween offering that its studio hoped it would be, it's all trick and no treat."
"For a story about a London harlot's trials and tribulations, this is one unsexy, drawn-out dirge with only a few smirking moments as relief."
"I like the concept... Neat-o, if entirely outlandish... The problem is, screenwriters Brit Marling and Mike Cahill -- she also stars; he also directs -- don't know where to take it beyond that initial premise."

A desperate attempt by Kevin Smith to pay homage to himself in a self-consciously left-handed way.
"The humor rarely flows naturally, instead arriving in the form of squabbling asides, designed specifically to be separate, segregated moments outside of the plot."
"If you believe that Elvis still lives or that a millennial invasion of flying saucers is imminent, you might buy the bogus premise."
"Wrapped up in the logistics of various dreamscapes and the technical details of dream sharing and inception, the picture all but abandons its most essential thread."
"OK, I admit I cried a small bucket at the end... but at least I hated myself for it. This is bland and obsequious tripe or, as my own dog would say, ""Woof!"""
Every cutaway to their McDonald's takeout bags or fluffy white puppies (there must be a dozen of them) emphasizes a bedrock tackiness that will convert your audience into a snorting gang of Marxists-at least for a while.
Rosenstrasse is again only a sad reminder of the earlier von Trotta.
"With Hanks as its star, Marc Forster’s safe Hollywood remake is all the more predictable."
"If you were curious about this movie because you thought there might be more to it than the obvious, don't overthink it -- the title truly is all you're going to get."
"Schmalzy and trite, it relies heavily on the goodwill and nostalgia."
Chappie is the second movie in a row in which Blomkamp fails at both social commentary and basic storytelling.
"If a film this crummy had been perpetrated on most ordinary rock stars, that would be bad enough but to present the life of someone as bold and iconoclastic as Mercury in such a formulaic manner almost feels like an insult."
"There's nothing meaningful or insightful going on here. It's a silly, trashy romp that throws a bunch of stuff at the wall and just hopes that some of it sticks."
"A mish mash of revenge, squeamish violence and surreal family drama that should please midnight madness fans but leave others reaching for a barf bag."
"Capably made but misguided in its attempts to satiate its fanbase, The Rise of Skywalker marks some kind of end to the franchise."
"Unfortunately, it's a desperately clunky affair."
"Twenty-eight days later, nobody will remember seeing it."
"Although the movie is handsomely mounted, its hand-held camerawork and ground-view of events shrinks the stature of its characters."
"It's a 'Tiger Beat' article in video form, a feature-length music video featuring the group's biggest songs and fluffy moments."
Back to the Future? Back to the drawing board!
"The director, William Malone, is like his villain: a sick person trying to justify what he's doing by making his audience voyeurs. He's like the character from Fight Club that splices hard-core porn into Disney films."
"Even if it had the courage of its convictions, The Lifeguard would still be hampered by its commitment to cliché."
"The ideas the film explores are worthy, but the execution is disappointing. Monsters and Men feels unfinished... The film contains the start of an important conversation, but the credits roll on an incomplete thought."
A raggedly written story with a creaky plot that no amount of WD-40 can remedy.
"The basic story is pretty strong, but the dialogue seems stiff and awkward. The acting is generally good, anchored by Gossett and Nelson."
The Snowman is a slog.
"A pedestrian, paint-by-numbers comedy that wallows in its own genericness."
"All the visual flourishes can't raise the narrative stakes of a movie rooted more in formula than character development or emotional payoff. By the end, you'll want to erase the memory of having watched it."
"With the lazy, misshapen ""The Ridiculous 6,"" Adam Sandler robs his new Netflix benefactors blind."

Patti Smith: Dream of Life vividly illustrates the rewards and pitfalls of a documentary film that is completely enamored of its subject.
"Classy, so long as you approach it without thought, basic narrative understanding, and resistance to unearned sentiment."
The only scary part in the movie is that it clearly opens the door for a Scream 4.
"In its sheer desire to entertain, the film takes whimsy to levels normally outlawed by the Geneva Convention."
"There's an essential insipidity here, matched by its predictable music score."
"A film that's right up there with Crash, The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996), and the Kennedy White House for sheer wasted potential and misguided ambition."

"As the plot points arrive, they're all stretched to the max. Even the film's most unexpected bit ... goes on and on and on."
Wrong-headed is an understatement in this new approach to the material and we are taken for a third act ride that is equal parts baffling and preposterous.
"What's tragic about ""Detective Dee"" is the fact that it rapes a chapter of Chinese history beyond any semblance of reality."
"Star Wars was never authentic science fiction: It was always old-school serial-style adventure dressed in sci-fi trappings with religious overtones. Still, it deserves better than the autopilot treatment it gets here. Geez..."
"Disappointing, over-long and over-directed Oscar-bait drama that's further hampered by a trying-too-hard performance from Jamie Foxx, though the always-excellent Robert Downey Jr. ensures that it remains just about watchable."
"Surely, this isn't the best of Abbott and Costello, as they've been so much funnier in the past."
"Like an obnoxious four-year-old who believes everything he does is fascinating and adorable, filmmaker Myles Berkowitz likes to announce, at the very start of a first date, that certain foods cause him to suffer from diarrhea or constipation."
I think I'll pass on The Amazing Spider-Man 3.
Batten down the hatches; here's a film that really blows.
"Self-styled eccentricity in and of itself can charm but only goes so far, and the film... offers little beyond that."
"In SUSPIRIA, Udo Kier says that ""Bad luck isn't caused by broken mirrors, but by broken minds""-Well after making this silly movie, director Alexandre Aja might think otherwise"
"Stock markets, bank accounts, and NSA sites aren't the only thing being hacked in Blackhat. The whole thing reeks of hackery."
"An overly worthy and Oscar-bothering piece,"
The sequel to Unbreakable and Split ratifies and underlines the limits and the excess of Shyamalan. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Ross directs indulgently and no one seems to have noticed the sound of the voices, as though the participants had their hearing aids switched off."
"Ultimately, it's hard to get emotionally invested with these thinly written characters."
"Whenever Larry isn't pensively biting on his chaw, he's barking out obscene one-liners in a guttural, noxious stream of little nasty explosions. He's a greasy, oil-burning joke jalopy."
"It plays like ""Generic Walt Disney Live-Action Fairy Tale: The Movie."""
"Poms is unfortunately exactly what it looks like, repackaged senior comedy clichés."
The second half [is] overwhelmingly mechanical at times and at others taxing. [Full review in Spanish]
"The movie is [Mary J.] Blige's first time getting top billing in a major motion picture ... and it's an unfortunate career misstep for her as an actress, due to her wooden acting in the film and the movie's silly plot."
The script falls back on the most common dramatic device in this year's sitcoms: A yuppie's humanity is touched for the first time when he's thrust together with a new family member. 
"Zhao unfurls the story of the Eternals on an epic and elaborate stage ... that ends up being a double-edged sword. We get a grandiose mythology ... alongside backstories ... [but] we are never given the time to understand, care for, or connect with them."
"...too adult for children and too childish for adults...There have been lots of ridiculous ideas for films foisted on the paying public, but this takes the cake."

Enjoyable only as escapism.
"By the time it reaches its supposedly crowd-pleasing finale, Baby Mama may have self-respecting comedy fans (and even Tina Fey fans) crying uncle."
The credits for Ninja Assassin list two screenwriters and one director. But it's fair to say the movie has come straight out of a box.
"It's a compact and symmetrical picture with all its plot points in the right places, but I never found it convincing in the slightest."
A formula flick that should have tapped out in the script stage.
"While [the cast is] definitely game, the filmmakers simply don't give them enough material for the task at hand."
"Nice to look at, the film's glum Miami Vice plot is subverted by the jiggy flavour of a film that's nothing more than an excuse for Martin Lawrence and Will Smith to play cops and robbers for two hours."
"The action's fairly toothless, and the abrupt, anemic ending promises a sequel. The filmmakers will have to pray pretty hard for that miracle."
"The movie has its moments, but director Paul Weitz paces things a bit like a cheesy carnival ride."
"You would have to be somewhere beyond deep-geek to defend Ghost Rider's unholy melding of religious mumbo-jumbo to motorcycle worship, western folklore, father-son psychology, and Elvis Lives wish fulfillment."
"Woman loses her grip in fact-based drama with sex, language."
"Despite captivating performances from both Dern and Stewart, Jeremiah Terminator Leroy never manages to break out of the drudgery of a standard biopic."
The movie's comic powers are often marred by silliness and stereotypes.
This preposterous relationship drama is ... LaBute's staunch defense of his own work.
Someone get masterful video game director Hideo Kojima on the line and throw out the idea for Metal Gear Fat Amy
"Quaintly enjoyable enough in its own way. Until it's slowly sunk by a certain divine Lion, bringing along all his earnestness and preciousness. It's a ride, all dressed up as a child-hero fantasy quest, that's meant to lead us to one red-light moral."
...the worst film to come out of Hollywood so far this year.
...makes you wonder if Spielberg and series producer George Lucas might have been going through some sort of drug phase.
"The Woke Army has won. The masculine icon of a 60 year reign is over. An archetype who was desired by all who met him , male and female, is now monogamous and madly in love. He almost cries."
"Louis-Dreyfus is on form, but her co-star's miscasting and the script's general thinness mean Nat Faxon and Jim Rash's film can't live up to Force Majeure, the 2014 Swedish movie on which it's based."
"It contains approximately twice the laughs of ""Sex and the City 2"" and half the number of bitches."
"A detached motion picture, and it's hard to get away with that clinical approach and still adhere to a thriller format."
"This should feel like a thrill ride IN SPACE, not like an actual 3-day trip to the moon where you wish the pulmonary embolisms developing in your legs would kill you."
"Mr. Rock, Dwayne Johnson these days, is a personable personality who has ridden that personableness to superstar heights. Sadly, there’s little sign of that quality in his work as Black Adam."
"With this cast, as well as director David Gordon Green on board, you expect a lot more than the occasional chuckle."
"Suffers from cumulative mediocrity. In other words, there's only so much recycled rubbish you can endure without wanting to take a hostage."
Oxygen feels more like a clunky stage play than an enigmatic futuristic psycho thriller...
"In the toothless cop caper 21 Bridges, the usually charismatic Boseman dons a tarnished badge in a cliched police procedural handcuffed by its rudimentary rhythms."
"Walker has something important to say with Countdown To Zero, but if this movie were standing on a doorstep with a petition, most reasonable people would sign it quickly and send it on its way, rather than inviting it in to chat."
"We may love the French and their spirit, their zest for life. But when they start falling in love with themselves, the whoopie turns to ennui."
"The performances help to create some tension if you can buy the outlandish premise, although the character motives remain cloudy and the contrived third-act twists keep the payoff at a frustrating emotional distance."
Focus in this film was wrong &#8230; does anybody care that Hanks-as-Col-Parker stole his money &#8230; E still had his own plane&#46; Hanks interpretation of Parker was unimpressive&#44; I don&#8217;t he understood the character&#46; BUT Austin Butler was sensational as E&#33; Yeah Baby&#33;
"The only saving grace for 'Bottle Shock' is the finale, which features Rickman laying down the rules -----"
"The horror plays much too safe. The idea of giving audiences exactly what they thought they were getting in the first film seems smart on paper, but this sequel is too afraid to take any real risks. Brahms game has become all too predictable."
"[Richard] Curtis never resolves how Jack deals with calling the Beatles' songs his own, and the film drags as Yesterday struggles to make Jack's guilt more entertaining. Thankfully, Patel can sing the Beatles' songs with conviction."
An intriguing misfire.
"There's a big difference between being mysterious and being ambiguous, but The Maze Runner seems to be under the impression that they're the same thing."
Uncharted emerges as a disjointed mess of a movie that cant decide if it wants to be full-on video game fun or slick cinematic treasure hunt&#44; leaving Holland swimming upstream against the current of a story thats as choppy as it is uninteresting&#46;
"“The Burning Sea” is a blunt reminder of two intertwined truths: Human-made environmental catastrophes are inevitable, and it’s hard to turn them into decent action movies."
"It's discouraging to watch Bad build an unusual rhythm in the opening scenes only to stop itself and sprint back into Madea/preach mode, where the uncomfortable marriage of Jesus and domestic violence reigns."
It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
"It would be easier to recommend it if only, like its characters, it didn't drift quite so easily, aimlessly knocked about by the tide."
"It's not that this is a bad film, after all it does have fine actors and it is based on a great story. It just doesn't live up to its predecessors."
"The whole point is to cheer as guns are fired, cars are crashed and blood is shed -- not pausing to ponder what a guy with an Austrian accent is doing as sheriff of a Mexican border town in the first place."
It's just a shame that there's about 65 minutes of movie where the only thing that's destroyed is the audience's patience.
The movie is like a bad kiss that's a little sloppy and uninspired... it leaves you disappointed.
"On the surface, [Cover] had a lot going for it: from the cast to the art direction to the verisimilitude of long-lived hostilities. But, particularly in the shadow of the incredible humanitarian crisis, the film felt like a series of missed opportunities."
Next Friday's a chronic snore.
"As for the resolution of the romantic triangle angle ... well, let's just say that the filmmakers would have been hard-pressed to come up with a worst ending."
Even Pinocchio himself would pan this flick.
"Will enthral pre-teen chippies with its wholesome, marshmallow-peep-sweet vacuous-ness."
"Rock's idea of 'edgy'? Jokes about boners, Viagra, and how nasty rap music scares white people."
Author: The JT LeRoy Story excels when it presents the facts ... but it fails to find or even look for any answers that would explain or contextualize that story.
"This empty, immature romantic comedy ultimately feels as if it's filled with all the hot air that separates New York and San Francisco, yet still manages to be a suffocating bore."
"The film is so murky, it looks as though it was put through a dark blue Instagram filter."
"Even for the trashy sub-genre it belongs to, ""Never Back Down"" is sadly just lazy action pablum as will the five Straight to DVD sequels be. I'll just stick to ""Karate Kid""..."
"You go away feeling soiled and confused, disliking and distrusting him more than you did going in."
This movie has some of the worst dialogue one can imagine: She: 'What about passion?' He: 'What about support?' She: 'What about betrayal?'
"By the end, one feels strangely compassionate yet intellectually detached, as if the hugs and not the lauding were their goal all along."
Wild Mountian Thyme is a cinematic oddity&#46; A film completely devoid of &#40;lucky&#41; charms but simultaneously a must-see movie&#46; Cult classic status awaits&#33;
A well-observed but emotionally muted costume drama.
"The film would all be a complete bore if it weren't for the odd sparks of wit, and the sparks set off by Sheen and B-picture queen Mitra."
'Valentine's Day' is one of the worst romantic comedies assembled. It does a serious injustice to the holiday.
Popular book heroine gets a bummer adaptation.
A grueling experience to sit through if you're not in on the central joke and Rauch's character.
"Avildsen draws good performances from the three actors who play PK, as well as from the ever-reliable Freeman and Mller-Stahl, but subtlety is abandoned when he focuses on the ring and teen romance."
"Hopefully this is the last we have seen of the Unisol series, but unfortunately the dearth of creativity in Hollywood, will allow it to live for another abysmal dumbing."
"The template is simply too obvious, leaving little doubt as to how the film will progress and what each character's eventual outcome will be."
"... becomes caught between a deeply internalized character study of a tortured artist combatting an identity crisis, and a more generic behind-the-scenes portrait of the economic realities of the music business."
Features Oscar winners Benicio Del Toro and Anthony Hopkins at their most take-the-money-and-run uninspired. That the film is set in the 1890s didn't prevent these two from phoning in their performances.
"Insidious is a crashing bore, and will likely only frighten people who have never seen any horror movies."
"No chemistry, no cool, no compelling characters, no air of urgency. Just a very average crime caper which fails to entertain the viewer on a gut, cerebral or superficial level. Not exactly your father's Miami Vice."
"""The Do-Over"" is Sandler doing literally anything he wants whether it makes sense or not."
"Yen's mission at least begins and ends well. But in the middle, our hero finds himself thwarted by a clash of tones, and tripped up by a snaking trail of subplots."
"It must be said that The Dead Girl is a film of considerable integrity. But before that, something else must be said: That's about as unappetizing an opening to a film as can be imagined."
"Formulaic post-apocalyptic thriller...when you don't especially care who lives and who dies, all the skull-crunching action doesn't amount to a hill of beans."
There&#8217;s too much narrative&#44; too many universes&#44; and too much CGI&#46; The MCU is becoming everything&#44; everywhere&#44; all at once&#46; And it&#8217;s simply too much&#46; Madness indeed&#46;
"A movie so oblivious to convention and structure that it seems like a Jackson Pollock splatter-painting, without the crucial 'genius' part."
"The story is unfocused, and capped by a resolution that has notable holes in reason, but even that could be forgiven in a cartoon with an arsenal of laughs."
"Lost in a series of crude, mean-spirited scenarios that includes a stupid Viagra gag and ends with a lip-synched musical number that reeks of creative desperation. The sole bit of inspiration is the Rohmer-esque 'Fin,' and it's a welcome sight."
Adding insult to injury is the eye-rollingly heavy-handed bent of the movie's third act...
"Has individual moments that are alluring to the eyes, but like the aforementioned dollhouse where Suzy lives, take a closer look inside and it becomes obvious how artificial all the parts are."
Everybody is so good and decent that it's hard to tell where the generals leave off and the gods start.
... a highly derivative teenage sex comedy that borrows liberally from Judd Apatow's soulful geek movies
These guys simply aren&apos;t funny&#44; so already withering material completely falls apart in their hands&#46;
"The unanswered questions in the original added to the mood, but by trying to answer even just a few of them, this Pulse just gets more confusing and less scary."
"Even with its superior cast and for all its early posturing, Taking Lives is just an excuse to stuff human beings into body bags."
Techs are as expected for a globetrotting adventure yarn. It is too bad that the script was not up to the behind-the-camera work.
Watson meanwhile continues to search for a role that deserves her talent and growing maturity; her determination in Colonia is clear and yet misplaced. And that's unfortunately also the case with the entire film.
"Nothing works in this ludicrous thriller, which fails to compel us with its roster of monstrous characters. Lily Collins is woefully miscast; Patrick Warburton and Simon Pegg are criminally wasted."
Filme auto-indulgente e sem ritmo que transforma o Homem de Aço em um galã sem personalidade.
"For this sort of thing to work, we need agile performers, but the proficient, dull Sorvino has no light touch, and Rodan is out of his league."
Witless and asinine. Not nearly as funny as The Hebrew Hammer.
"If malignant misogyny transformed into a person, it would be the villain in Run Sweetheart Run."
"Everyone involved, including the audience, deserves a better movie than this, and for fans of the book, it's possible some out there might not find the film version a disappointment, but like everything else in ""Dark Places"" that seems unlikely."
"Below water, these cretins have to keep their yaps shut, and you can concentrate on the film's true features: Some beautiful photography and the real treasure -- Alba's booty."
"Tie me up, tie me down, make me watch bad films. Just no more ""Fifty Shades,"" please."
... only occasionally sparks to life and too often lacks depth and context in its clinical study of Fischer's behavior and mannerisms.
"Slow, weird and disjointed..."
"For the most part it's just a dumb whodunnit that has as many twists and turns as a toothpick, along with inappropriate-behavior gags that lack imagination and get tiresome quickly."
"Flabby, unfocused reunion in which the emotional content is drowned out by the incessant pursuit and plugging of designer shoes, gowns and handbags."
"You're left with stilted dialogue and dark, underlit sets."
"Trying to upstage its predecessors at all costs, this crowd-pleasing nonsense provides adrenaline-fueled fun for a while before running out of gas."
"It's not unusual to see great European actors appearing in big-budget dreck, of course, but the participation of Fassbender (who also produced!) and Cotillard seems particularly unnecessary."
"While it doesn't completely lack structure, the informative nature found in most documentaries is absent."
"Overwrought kitsch is never too very far away from the movie, but it grows actively campy in the glumly long second half."
"Gorgeous and vacant, The Eternals is the most numbing entry in Marvel's 13-year-old MCU franchise -- even as it struggles to be its weirdest and most philosophical."
"Filter out the gloss, the gore and the insistent techno score, and all you're left with are the gleaming pecs and bulging biceps of Wesley Snipes as Buff the Vampire Slayer."
"Alas, the second time proves no charm for The Pink Panther 2, Steve Martin's latest flimsy attempt to resurrect Sellers' bumbling Inspector Clouseau for the 21st century."
"The filmmakers have one good idea ... Otherwise, the picture remains imagination-free."
This is the sort of ho-hum production that will likely seem less disappointing on a smaller screen.
Is this funny? Soitenly not!
"There are literal fireworks, but not much wonder. A stunning disappointment, despite clear effort to be different."
This movie needed something to give it a fresh spin.
Somewhere in there is a pretty good western. If only we could see more of it amid the ballast.
"While Hello Again has been brought to the big screen, it has not been brought to anything resembling cinematic life."
"Overall, the level of wit and invention from writer-directors Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg is well below their scripts for the three ""Harold and Kumar"" movies."
An unimpressive criminal thriller that gets lost through the streets of LA. [Full review in Spanish]
"Allen presents the side-by-side stories as if to compare the comic and tragic views of experience, and it might work but for the fact that the two [playwrights] come up with dissimilar plots featuring different characters played mostly by different actors"
A shallow lie of a film that promises sweet songs and emotional understanding but presents only the ugliest of humanity.
"...a hopeless 'erotic thriller' that, as it happens, is neither..."
"Not the best, not the wurst."
"When working with the stunted and embarrassingly simplistic dialogue, neither actor is able to inject any life into the mundane prose they're given."
Did I mention it's really long?
"Bodies and buildings blow up but this is carnage of the most lacklustre sort, with any momentum petering out long before it's ""game over."""
I've had bigger scares from the windows at FAO Schwarz.
"For all its bluster, Game Night isn't really much of anything."
"Competently mounted in its studiedly immersive, elongated way, Zwick's earnest costume epic dresses a knee-jerk, reactionary sensibility in exotic garb."
A well-meaning but formulaic movie with not enough time to transcend predictable clichés.
A better title for THE HOBBIT: THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES would be: 'Rubbish: The Desolation of Tolkien'.
"An unconventionally conventional movie about connecting in the sexual Facetime era, one that's more intriguing than it has any right to be, but less surprising than it needs to be,"
It's very strange to watch painful verities staged in a way that diminishes their power under the guise of amplifying it. This is a film about deep-seated systems of oppression that feels tonally like a superhero origin myth.
It's about lost shoes and bloody noses.
"Macdonald has always been a welcome onscreen presence, and Puzzle offers the actress maybe her meatiest movie role yet. She finds the honesty amongst the inauthenticity of the script, even when her Scottish accent peeks out."
"Mildly titillating, but not very good."
"An unhinged mess of a movie, with potentially dangerous ideas handled in a winking, cynical manner."
We all know a movie like this isn't appealing to anyone beside the folks who grew up during that time. And even they will be compelled to cringe at its mention...
The milieu is more convincing than the story.
The net result is boredom unless you're already heavily invested in this series and bringing your own enthusiasm to the table.
Perhaps frightening in 1974&#44; it really doesn&apos;t hold up today unless you can forget the 12&#44;000 films exactly like it&#44; which is difficult&#46;
Isn't the movie that's going to refurbish Shyamalan's star--it's a muddled attempt to meld comedy and horror that doesn't succeed particularly well as either.
"No one has ever accused Ghostbusters II of being a great film, or even a good one, for that matter"
Borderline insufferable.
"[A] solemn, incoherent, brown film."

DIRTY GRANDPA is nothing more than an exercise in wink-and-nudge boorishness that leaves a bad taste in your mouth.
It whacks you over the head with it like a puffy bouquet of foam flowers. The beating doesn't actually hurt - it's too cute to hurt - but you do get annoyed with it
"I hadn't seen a whale in a while... a perverse psychological thriller, an art-history leviathan and a pastel lullaby of touchable things and thieved portfolios, a languorous three hours and eight minutes that peruses high art for the sake of hot ham."
"Wolfboy Animal Instincts Rule. This visually impressive outing harboring a cruel heart has the trappings of an enticing confection - with a toxic list of ingredients attached. And more akin to those those kid takeover ""beware the children"" horror movies."
"Ultrahack Ridley Scott redefines banality in House of Gucci, a cornball reality drama."
"It's got some effective moments and aspects, but the film goes in and out of plausibility, and its elements never manage to unify into a coherent whole."
"Given that the film gives us ample time to catch our breath in-between the punching, kicking and shooting it will be easier to wish that it had all been condensed into an accessible YouTube video of just the action bits."
"This could have been the second-best Nicholas Sparks movie had it just been Ira and Ruth's story. Instead, The Longest Ride is weighed down by an unnecessary second story that tries too hard, and bullpen full of clichs."
"Allen appears to have looked no further than The Catcher in the Rye or MAD Magazine to get a handle on how young people behave, and the results are excruciatingly stilted and phoney."
Morgan devolves quickly into a glossy but familiar horror film content to bloody one member of its remarkable cast to a pulp after another.
[A film for] pre-brain Playstation 11-year-old American males ...
Can you say booooring?
"America could probably use a good laugh just about now, what with all the problems plaguing this society. But the exploitation of children even if they are actors and the special effects are occasionally awesome, is way beyond just not cool."
"Jesse Dylan's direction is slapdash and lackluster; sometimes he can't seem to decide where to point the camera, or who should be in focus."
"Hitman is the oddest of action movies %u2014 a film all but devoid of action. Not satisfied with simply being another mindless video game adaptation, the film also forgets to be entertaining."
"It's relentless, monotonous and just not much fun."
"Neither savage nor graceful, Savage Grace's creaky -- and creepy -- tale of mother-son incest doesn't get the art-film benefit-of-the-doubt that led critics to acclaim Swoon."
"It has wonderful visuals and some terrific beats, yet has little-to-no story with woefully thin and passive characters."
Rogen vs. Rogen is roughly half as amusing as the least amusing Rogen character ever.
"While Platt certainly has a knack for eerie atmospherics, there's simply not enough here despite the ample talent on display."
The lesson to learn from The Medallion is that a wire- and computer-assisted Jackie Chan is better than no Jackie Chan but still a bad idea nonetheless.
A vast improvement over the previous two installments of the series taking on the health insurance industry in the series' first overtly political statement.
"These flies drift lethargically from place to place, and the movie bogs down in their lackadaisical pace."
"It clearly is trying to make some sociopolitical statements, but the harrowing and pessimistic glee it seemingly has for its own fate is slightly off-putting."
"Flimsy sex farce, despite Taraji P. Henson's exuberant performance."
"The Bronze is the worst sports comedy since ""The Benchwarmers."
"If you're looking for groundbreaking badness, you needn't look much further than the new Exorcist prequel, which is one interminably grisly waste."
"For all the millions its antihero fritters away, the movie is dramatically miserly, with a scope too small for the emotions at stake."
"It leaves me unmoved, although I can see why it appeals to some, with its ethereal touches, its internal workings and its cute children, all wrapped in the melancholy story of a husband and father taken too soon from them in an outback accident."
"Unfortunately, Thornton's love for its iconography doesn't quite bring it to life."
Think you know all about the legend of Robin Hood? Ridley Scott wants to fill you in on every bloody detail.
"It's a posturing, pandering tale of sexual obsession in thrall to its own overweening self-importance."
"The trailer for The Apparition contained more story than the picture it was promoting. In fact, I think the trailer for The Apparition is actually more of a movie than The Apparition."
"But journeys of redemption involve contrition: a change of clothes, a shower, ironed hair. And... the moment Tammy renews her commitment to living among other human beings, she becomes quiet and unsure, easily pushed to tears."
Remake of much-admired 1960 drama about a maid who becomes her wealthy employer's toy and the dark consequences that ensue has some Chabrol and Hitchcock stamped all over it but not much underneath.
[Christian Cantamessa has] the eye of a promising director-now he just needs a better script.
The Best Man Holiday could have been a more entertaining dramedy about friendship and redemption if Malcolm D. Lee's script didn't attempt to pull every tear-jerking normality in the book.
"It's impossible to guess why Bullock was ever attracted to this insulting role, and the eternally confident Reynolds is miscast as a young, bullied underling."
"When this lump of coal isn't being schmaltzy and falsely mysterious, it's being harsh."
"As if watching listless characters exchange infantile monologues isn't bad enough, the ""villain of the week"" is a complete bore."
"I can respect a movie that mocks things I believe in if it does it well, but not if it peters out before it's finished."
"This low-rent, convoluted follow-up gives the great original a bad name."
"Unfortunately, Albert is so good at being unobtrusive, he nearly disappears from his own story, making it hard for us to get invested in it."
This production clearly ploughed all its budget into a few slick action sequences and the cameo from Willis. It's a pity the film-makers didn't invest in the screenplay.
"...a homogenized message about false gods, freedom and equality in a story that plays like 'Spartacus' without its gladiatorial arena."
"A clear case of not enough gas and too much Diesel, who should have copped a plea of overreaching in the third degree."
"Loud, brash, and almost entirely laugh-free."
"There's more random eye-plucking in See No Evil than in the Old Testament. While the image is undeniably repellent, it also quickly becomes rather dull."
"You can't deny the inspirational qualities of the story or Parker's screen presence, any more than you could accuse the film of subtlety or of masking its conspicuous pro-Christian agenda."
"As supremely talented as everyone involved is, the depth beyond the visuals is lacking."
"It's an exploitation film fraught with faux-sincerity, and ultimately it's utterly ridiculous."
Depp massively overplays it in this embarrassing and shockingly unfunny self-produced farce.
"Predictable, far from hilarious, with director John Hamburg's coming across as second-tier Judd Apatow"
Shoddy.
"I disliked these guys immediately, saw no indication that the film was going to extract anything of value out of their characters, and walked out of the movie about an hour into it."
... where it falters is the latter half of the story... and the evolution (or lack thereof) of its protagonist and reluctantly drawn heroine.
"This atavistic Christians-vs-Moors narrative doesn't belong in the present day, and that's no doubt why so many people are addicted to it: it's so ideologically overstated that it can easily be brushed off as harmlessly quaint escapism."
"Yeah, you can pick up on (more or less) what's happening within a few minutes. But I can't say it's really worth it."
I had trouble finding the humor and the point and wasn't concerned enough to be as provoked as I'm sure is intended.
A figurative and nearly retch-inducing celebration of the ovary.
Like Bland.
Wristcutters: A Love Story is somewhat original and amusing. But only somewhat.
Bad Company is good company only when it is most natural.
There's not just a good movie but a great one buried deep within this mess of espionage cliches.
"These derivative YA stories, riddled with post-apocalyptic battles and love triangles, feel interchangeable, like they're all drawn from the same grab-bag of ideas. The 5th Wave does nothing to set itself apart from this hodgepodge."
"[Writer Jonathan Lemkin] never streamlined the plot enough to make this the fully accessible 'popcorn picture' it aims to be. Frankly, I defy any average moviegoer to accurately recount Shooter's knotty story."
"Mary Kay Place is very good as a woman whose life is full of despair. The movie is just too much of a trudge through the bad times of ""Diane's"" life."
"This ""Punch"" never truly connects."
"""The Phoenix Incident"" is an indigestible mess."
"We, on the other hand, do-si-doze."
I guarantee you will never watch Smackdown without thinking about what is going on beyond the mat.
The emotional connection that should have the crowd cheering wildly for the heroes and booing the villains never clicks in.
The greatest actors in the world can't overcome a script that boils everything down to the Esperanto of cliche.
High school drama and alien wars become one and we get a movie that feels like it would be better suited as a CW television show than the kick-off to what Dreamworks/Touchstone quite obviously hopes will be a long term franchise
... ultimately stretches its one-note premise to a punishing 111 minutes.
Who was the real Christopher Robin? Simon Curtis tries his hand at an answer in this gentle to the point of insipid drama.
"The film's tendency to over-explain, over-intellectualize, and over-script events leaves little room for spontaneity and doubt."
Depressingly laugh-free comedy that's so irredeemably awful that you'll wonder why Martin Lawrence isn't in it.
"A nervy mixture of character study, romantic drama and thriller, ""Stillwater"" ends up a little out of its depth."
"If I have interpreted the message of ""Rumor Has It"" correctly, then its message is that it's OK to run off and fool around as long as you return to a very understanding partner."
"If it weren't for the wonderful soundtrack, Nick Castle and James Hart's screenplay wouldn't have made it past the slush pile."
I detected only charlatanism.
"Like virtually every sequel to a hit comedy, it recycles and essentially beats to death everything that got a laugh in the original film."
"Infinity War inherits plenty of the problems endemic to crossovers: the privileging of quantity over quality, of spectacle over story, and of the shock value of major changes to the status quo over just about everything else."
"Day-Lewis is a great actor, but his choices show a solemn earnestness that may be hurting his career (and talent?)."
"Certainly the idea of an Emoji Movie is worse than what is actually onscreen. And I was actually a little amused when the ""smiley"" or other ""meh"" emoji struggled to express themselves."
"Even though the film clocks under two hours, it seems longer than a Lord of the Rings marathon played on slow motion."
I needed to take a shower after just watching the film.
Marguerite suffers from a storytelling tameness that erodes the power of its subject.
Screenwriter Angus MacLachlan attempts something bold -- broad themes about a society in moral decline -- but he fails to find the story in all that philosophizing.
"Aside from Beatty's performance, the only consistent thing the movie has going for it is ineffable strangeness; it seems to be trapped at the bottom of the chasm that separates its subversive aims from its nostalgic pursuits."
"Bizarrely, the human-doll mishmash is the least unnerving component of the story. What takes the cake is Zemeckis smashing himself into the narrative, with an egregious and self-indulgent sequence homaging his own career-defining time-hopping story."
"Even the best movies push emotional buttons, but they work because viewers become wrapped up in the story. This one is so manipulative you can hear the gears grinding - until they lock up."
The hack novel by Michael Crichton did not inspire anyone to the level of Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.
"The film says nothing meaningful or especially probing about father-son relationships, the dilemmas facing modern science, corporate power or the role of the military."
"Funny this may be, but for all the wrong reasons."
"Depardieu is a very shaggy beastie in this film, deliberate and bullish, blown up to prehistoric size and pretty much headed for extinction at the hands of French bureaucracy."
...ineffective and underwhelming...
"Hesher, whose arrival on screen is almost always heralded by a demonic speed-metal riff, is a delinquent sociopath with a heart of gold. That's the false, rather cloying concept behind this smug indie dud..."
"The general lack of stakes makes it seem like Lucasfilm made Solo to serve two typically opposite forces: diehards who want confirmation of every detail within an expanded universe, and Disney executives that like boatloads of money to come..."
"A misconceived prequel that's too archly artificial for kids, too witlessly juvenile for adults, and too tedious for viewers of any age."
"Tim Story's update of the blaxploitation classic is shamelessly regressive. Male dinosaurs again walk the earth with misogynistic and homophobic impunity. These are the laughs, folks. Don't be surprised if they stick in your throat."
"The film careens from idiocy to inanity, occasionally surfacing above the muck for a semi-kick-ass action scene or two."
"It's dull and forgettable, unable to stir up a passable amount of absurdity to make its dim sense of humor even the least bit interesting."
"A Monster Calls, to be sure, but will anyone care to answer?"
Fired Up plays like a direct-to-video American Pie sequel.
"Baywatch works hard to earn its R rating, but this kind of tame raunch won't amuse anybody who's seen a comedy in the last twenty years."
"A lurid, splattery wallow in grime, blood and excrement."
"What to Expect When You're Expecting doesn't find new laughs, just layers on attempts at the tried-and-true ones - think one scene in which a woman howls and makes funny faces during labor is funny? How about many of them together?"
The special effects are certainly well done and the tech angle is a decent idea. If only the script was smart enough to pull off its post-modern flourishes.
"Illumination Entertainment has dispensed with almost all of Dr Seuss' endearing dialogue, which is a shame, because the film could do with more of a personality of its own."
"It's not that Baby Mama is an outright bad movie. It's just so thoroughly typical, a one-note, odd-couple, laff-lite film featuring two Saturday Night Live veterans that reminds you of so many other dashed-together SNL vet films."
"Despite fair fast-paced tension, the film is littered with forgettable unlikeable characters that build to a farfetched twist that lacks the WOW factor of the original movies."
"The plot is plastered with one Hollywood cliche after another, most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults."
Earwig and the Witch makes a strong case for the ugliest animated work by a major studio in years.
The race card is played ad nauseam throughout the film
The series has gotten to the point where there is now effectively Nothing to See Here.
The logical leap required to accept a premise as monumentally stupid as this one transcends mere suspension of disbelief and lands somewhere more troubling.
Emblematic of the underside of 70s American film.
Recycled magic proves pretty tepid in &#8220;Hocus Pocus 2&quot;&#46;&#46;&#46;even less engaging than its predecessor&#46;
Will someone get this man a steadicam?
"It's difficult not to see My New York Year as a dulled, quaint film quickly forgotten in the shadow of a better movie: The Devil Wears Prada."
"Dumont's self-conscious approach drains the film of emotional impact and spiritual depth, turning it into little more than stylized pageantry"
"Just as the central criminal steals the identity of his victims, Taking Lives lifts traits and style from other movies. Both do so relatively successfully, until they bungle the job in the final half-hour."
"As I left the theater, I found that my thumbs ached. I hadn't realized that, during certain parts of the movie, I was pressing imaginary buttons as if trying to control some video game."
"Operating on the principle that lame verbal and visual gags are funny if the audience is repeatedly pummeled with them, Wedding Crashers sorely lacks a strong script and the kind of inventive direction worthy of its not-untalented leads."
"Instead of being a symbolism-laden parable about hypocrisy and set-morals, it decides to become a condemnation of Puritan lifestyles, not because they're a bunch of hypocrites, but because, hey, they won't have sex!"
"Boasting a strong cast, that includes Julia Roberts, and some intriguing twists on the popular fairy tale Mirror Mirror falls flat. It all feels second right despite everyone's best effort."
"Buddy spies vie for the same girl in a loud, pushy romantic comedy."
"While the actors do make the movie tolerable, they don't save it. A complete script overhaul is the only thing that can do that."
"You Were Never Really Here feels much more remote and unreal in its scenario, and though it has been compared several times already to Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver (1976), I'm not sure that the comparison holds weight."
This fantasy blend of live-action and digital animation is just never quite as wondrous as it really should be.
"Armored should crackle with nervous energy; however, the bland characters don't get much of interest to do and are virtually interchangeable."
"If Uncle Frank is the story of a man forced to reconnect with his family, it'd be nice if his family were made up of human beings."
"After the smooth finish of Mary and Max earlier this year, $9.99 can't match up with its similar dark themes."
"Aspires to the cracked lunacy of The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai, but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like The Adventures of Ford Fairlane."
"An epic that wanders the Sahara, searching for a reason for being."
There's not much to convince you that High Fidelity isn't a vanity production with some good tunes.
"So much of the movie's script is exposition... that it feels drowned, too. In addition, illicit romance, jealousy, and competition are pebbled in so that the film's focus pulls from the operation itself."
"Boseman is the bright spot in an otherwise generic, predictable movie."
Doesn't approach the emotional resonance of Franco Zeffirelli's immensely popular 1968 screen version.
"I'd rather watch 'Teen Wolf' on repeat than yawn through 'The Wolfman' again. It's the type of movie where you can fall asleep for 20 minutes, wake up and realize you didn't miss a thing."
"If you think Eddie Murphy lost his mojo about 20 years ago and has been lacking clear comedic judgment ever since, then you've got to see this for confirmation. Or maybe not."
A missable culmination to the 20-year X-Men franchise thus far.
"It's an intriguing premise, weakened by a script lacking in strong forward motion."
"A one-joke comedy that is indulged for far too long and, in the end, becomes a pat morality tale."
"Just remember, kids, you're not paranoid if they're really out to get you...or your movie dollars."
[It] sinks faster than a rock.
"Okay for those who dote on 'classics illustrated' in the Merchant Ivory line, but not as fluid as all that."
It's legitimately funny. Not sure that was the intention.
"Makes you wish the Peruvian-born director, well known for ferreting out telling ironies, would have dug deeper or perhaps gone broader in her overview of these symbiotic relationships."
"Their 40-year marriage seems like more of a trial than this overweening, lightly likable movie acknowledges."
"The one thing that Chazelle seems to have little interest in is life. He turns Mia into an absolute cipher, giving her nothing whatsoever to talk about."
"In Acrimony, Tyler Perry works the female character up to those stereotypical roles, educating the audience on just how they are made. This is not enough to save the film from its own cliché and culturally damaging ending, however."
"Dough has such very good intentions -- characters separated by race, religion and age can find common ground in a bakery -- it's a shame that it doesn't rise into a tasty loaf but instead remains just a bit wholemeal and stolid."
"Sadly, it seems that Shyamalan is channeling George Lucas et al from The Phantom Menace... and said, 'Hey, let's do that with this movie!'"
Land is positioned as an exploration of grief and survivor's guilt - a crowded celluloid space - but the lack of distinctive figures renders Wright's film picturesque but fallow.
As disposable as one of those diapers.
McCarthy can make Carol likable and relatable but even someone as talented as she is can't make this earnest do-gooder interesting.
Eubank's directing style jumps around as he goes from shaky hand-held shots to sequences filmed with so little movement they play as being very cold.
"I won't revisit ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" any time soon, but I don't regret giving it a chance."
"As storytelling, 5 Flights Up is remarkably clumsy: the narrative strands never knit together, the well-intentioned messages are awkwardly spelt out, and the stakes remain low. That said, it's an easy film to watch."
A stoner comedy that runs out of gas.
"As much as the fervent ""Anchorman"" supporters might have wanted a sequel, the redundant ""Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues"" sees to it that Ron Burgundy is kind of no longer a big deal."
A mediocre action picture that never anchors itself enough to tell a competent story&#46;
"It's obviously possible to make compelling movies about true crime committed by unsympathetic people, but this sure isn't one of them."
"The jokes are often juvenile and gross, unsophisticated and insensitive, but one does not wish to strike juvenility or grossness or even insensitivity outright from the comic tool kit; these just aren't all that good."
"""Minions"" is product, pure and simple. Little kids will love it, but grown-ups will feel like they're being held hostage in a Fisher-Price test laboratory."
One very expensive flop.
Whatever room might have been opened for introspection is vanquished by intrusive narration that lays out everyone's background.
"This isn't a commentary on the breakdown of law and order, of civil society itself -- it's a symptom of it."
Routine revenge flick offers little to the genre.
"After 30 minutes or so, Gonalo Tocha's anthropological proposition slides into dubiousness."
"Without due process or a culprit to wrap up the story line, Zodiac needs a more solid center on which to hang its story."
The subdued romance at its center might not be enough to keep some horror fans trudging along this twisted journey.
"""Hysteria,"" with its period costumes and English accents, seems like a much better movie than it is."
"...the stage play went to the screen for Minnelli to direct. However, somewhere in the translation, something got lost."
"A well-meaning, good-souled, essentially nave dud."
"Disaster movies are often silly fun. Geostorm is way too heavy on the silly, which makes it not as much fun as it could, or should, have been."
Impressive cast can't advance the flick's snail pace.
Leaves us wondering less about its ideas and more about its characterization of Hitler and the contrived nature of its provocative conclusion.
"Diablo Rojo PTY has some great moments and includes a lot of fascinating Panamanian folklore, but it quickly reaches the point of having too much."
"Despite a palpable chemistry between Kidman and Firth, Before I Go to Sleep lacks the level of sheer suspense and fear factor we've come to expect in amnesia thrillers (the best example being the daring Memento)."
"Where the movie fails, ultimately and sadly, is in its capitulation to conventional action movie wisdom."
"Aside from the novelty of two acting legends working together, Righteous Kill plays like a pumped-up episode of Law and Order, with the lurid benefits of the R rating."
"A cold fish. It just lies there, too lethargic to be funny and too timid to be sexy, but not deep enough for any real drama."
[Feels] at times like a infomercial for a greatest-hits album.
"Massoglia is so bland he barely registers on film, which is a bit too appropriate for a vampire role."
"For Levinson, Beatty, and Toback this was an important roll of the dice. Looks to me like they come up craps."
It's very difficult to feel anything for Brad besides absolute contempt.
A slickly styled exercise in pointlessness.
"Although grounded in the fact-based world of academia, The History Boys offers little of substance."
"A melodrama is a melodrama, even if the people in it occasionally announce something like, 'I figured out how to get a lower bound for H.'"
"... emphasizes brutal katana violence over character depth, while never taking full advantage of its unique backdrop. It's more about spectacle than substance."
There's nothing shocking anymore about [Clark's] zit-pocked brand of titillation.
"There's more to Reddy than her self-destructive spouse, and it's very strange that ""I Am Woman"" doesn't recognize that, resulting in a disappointing film."
"Whatever humour was left in the guys-gone-wild porn of the Hangover franchise dribbles and trickles and slips out, one quarter-chuckle every half-hour or so, in the third instalment."
Eastwood found a way to turn the whole thing into a big drag.
"The film is overlong, with too many unnecessary scenes (a lot of the movie seems like pointless running around), but it packs in a few scary moments and offers a nicely ambiguous conclusion."
The film inspires almost no feeling at all - even the Friday the 13th movies bother giving the bad guy a backstory.
"It's difficult to imagine Midsommar satisfying true horror fans, but if you're interested in witnessing some ultra-strange cult rituals, it more than fits that bill."
"It's admirable that Garner wants to expand beyond the bubbly romantic-comedy and supportive mom roles that have been her bread-and-butter, but it would have been nice if she had taken a knife to the script and demanded something better."
"[The] actors made the choice to treat this script as award-worthy material instead of the hilarious schlock it is, and the performances are gorgeously melodramatic."
Ultimately suffocates on its own good taste.
Surely there came a point in this extravaganza when the director&#44; the producers&#44; the actors&#44; and the people who did the catering&#44; began to feel it had all gone wrong&#46; 
"Despite a charming cast, this playful young adult take on Sherlock Holmes is elementary stuff."
"The movie isn't painfully bad, something to be 'fully experienced'; it's just tediously bad, something to be fully forgotten."
Koepp has no real feel for romantic whimsy.
"You don't want to see Rock the Kasbah. If you do, you're reading the wrong newspaper."
Bring back Jack Black and forget this.
"This is a disappointing follow-up to On Body and Soul, and in many ways works in opposite directions to that film."
while Watson and Mescal handle the mother-son relationship &#46;&#46;&#46; quite well&#44; a tendency toward stacking the deck limits the potency that God&#8217;s Creatures could have had&#46;
"There might be a riveting adventure thriller to be made from Dan Brown's controversial bestseller, but this is not it. Melodramatic, overlong and dare I say occasionally boring, Ron Howard's The Da Vinci Code gets lost in the maze of its puzzles and media"
"In spite of a star-studded Hollywood cast, Secret manages to clothesline itself on an unsatisfying twist ending."
It's better than the first one. Now please stop.
"Probably fast-paced enough to keep the kids engaged, but I say hold out for the inevitable Snowball-centered spinoff."
"The bad news for Pattinson is that it offers him nothing to do except play a more grown-up character, one whose dullness is amplified by the misfortune of having to share so much screen time with Christoph Waltz."
"The look of the movie was kind of soft, it wasn't real gritty. It looked low-budget."
The thinness of the conception gives the actors so little room to maneuver that they turn in uniformly one-note performances.
"Its central characters never find much chemistry - Clarke's Kate is a one-note character, which is one note more than Golding's character gets..."
"The scenery is dull and the romance is a boring ride--neither the places nor people offer much to write home about. Aimless and ambling along, this is a rom-com that seems totally random."
"Ao descartar qualquer sinal de sutileza em seu trabalho, Spike Lee dilui o drama de seu protagonista em um oceano de sofrimento."
"Perhaps a metaphor for showbiz backstabbing, this terror comedy creates a realistic standup comedy nightclub atmosphere but seems timid about going much further with either its jokes or its horror."
"Today's kids are learning from the Turtles that the world is a sinkhole of radioactive waste, that it's more reassuring to huddle together in sewers than take your chances competing at street level, and that individuality is dangerous. Cowabunga."
"Among the stupidest of stupid comedies. Jim Carrey is typically manic, but shows none of the acting nuances on display in films like The Majestic."
The symbolism [is] clobbering.
"Producers Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg deploy an arsenal of noisy special effects to demonstrate the invaders' high-tech superiority, which makes Olyphant's inability to breach an Internet firewall look pretty silly."
"Facing the Giants falls victim to the tell-don't-show brand of filmmaking, in which every character always says exactly what he's feeling and every time a character's flaws are pointed out to him, they are immediately corrected."
Thatcher. Reagan. Flock of Seagulls. These weren't the only evil things from the 1980s. There were also Hollywood fantasy movies such as this one . . .
"When the groans outnumber the laughs, you know you're watching a bad comedy."
"The script is abysmally bad, filled with Shakespearean dialogue such as ""I won't touch you until I have your written consent"", and ""I don't make love, I f***... HARD"""
"A hokey and often silly commentary about the medical industry, and corruption within the establishment."
We are told from the beginning that this is a true story. So I want to give a true opinion: it stinks.
A chilly business.
Don't waste your time being offended by Death of a President. This reeking excuse of a mockumentary deserves to be completely forgotten.
Another horror movie about a little girl possessed by a demon? Seriously?
The un-Rush Hour!
"There are LONG stretches of... well, real time."
"""Handsome Devil"" studies formulaic coming-of-age movies a little too closely."
"God is played, once again, by Morgan Freeman, whose suave charm can sell all sorts of silliness, but not the amiable imbecility peddled by this film."
"Silliness creeps in, and it doesn't matter very much onscreen that Neeson is claiming he chewed wolf jerky to prepare for his role."
It's one of the most insufferable and empty things you could ever hope to avoid.
"Several powerful narratives vie for supremacy in the political drama ""The Forgiven,"" but this sluggishly paced film's disparate parts never come together as a compelling whole."
[Williams] remains a presence of grace in a film that is otherwise not up to his very particular talents.
This might be the last time for another several features that Bond actually feels like a secret agent.
Harriet never feels like a fully formed human being with all the doubts and desires that come with that distinction.
"Though based on an original and respected novel, Hyams' horror thriller comes across as a pastiche of the genre's conventions as evident in major pictures of the past two decades, such as Jaws and the first two Alien films."
"Railing against Scary Movie V for diminishing the series' standards would be as effective as criticising Brooke Hogan for disgracing her proud family name. And yet, the fifth instalment of the Scary Movie franchise does do that."
"One long, extensively choreographed fight sequence in which ""mortal"" blows are delivered so often, and with so little lasting impact, that a brawl just becomes a brawl becomes a brawl."
"It's extremely violent --- and bloody --- with a penchant for the macabre. And at times, SUSPIRIA is downright silly and stupid."
"The film sets out to be large, dramatic and powerful -- as well as endearing -- and misses on every point."
"That something so carefully slapdash and happily juvenile actually resulted in cyber-sabotage and threats of violence is, in itself, an enormous kind of joke. Too bad it's the biggest one here."
"Sure, Eastwood's made bad movies before, but as with his fellow great director-star Woody Allen, there's a feeling that this time the creative decline is irreversible."
Rosi completely fails to connect the two sides of the story together.
It tries to stick to the original Stephen King story but without the pace or cleverness. [Full review in Spanish]
Foolishly attempts to update the 1974 classic by cranking the volume and inflating the Noo Yawk attitude to a cartoonish level of macho posturing.
The Kindergarten Teacher is painful to watch primarily because it uses exploitation as a means to further understand an overlooked woman trying to stand out among the world's population.
"[The] script is so free of genuine insight into his beautiful but childish characters that it's hard to work up any sympathy for their shallow, juvenile problems."
"It is a familiar story, but told with great charm and with sharp observations of how these academia types talk to each other and interact."
"It's a trifle of a movie, with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center."
"Plays like what it is, a quick and pretty, but ill-thought-through attempt to cash in on a popular French kids' cartoon."
"It's an underdog story tailor-made for the movies, devoid of surprises but touching all the same."
"The first of two sequels shot in immediate succession, Dead Man's Chest bears the unenviable burden of racking the pins for both movies, which leaves it with precious few opportunities to have a little fun of its own."
Occasionally hits heights worthy of its Sergio Leone-inspired title ... but its manic invention exhausts more than enthralls.
A major waste...generic.
"I'm not as angry reflecting on the nonfiction jumble ""Fed Up"" as I was during its slovenly length, but from modest distance, it still feels like a ruinously wasted opportunity, an inconvenient botch."
This story is so trippy it could use some clarity.
"Annabelle, the Nun, the devil, the face in the mirror: In a ""Conjuring"" movie, the forces of blasphemous evil are presented as ""real,"" but they seem about as real as the exhibits in a funhouse. Or, in this case, a not-so-fun house."
"Curiously though, as it so often does, the rare convergence of everything gone wrong makes for pretty compulsive viewing."
"It's just one blazing gun battle, knife fight and torture scene after another, staged in a vaguely tongue-in-cheek Tarantino style by French director Xavier Gens, with cardboard characters, Ed Wood dialogue and the storytelling values of a cockfight."
"WITH all the talent, time and effort that has gone into making a movie like this, I hate reducing it to one word. But here goes. Revolutionary Road is ... AWFUL."
"The screenplay, by John Patrick Shanley, who won an Oscar for his ""Moonstruck"" script, panders to the kiddie audience and is weak and plodding."
"Maybe if the film tried to make a point about police ineffectuality or corruption, these preposterous twists could have been justified. But this isn't that kind of movie."
"based on the Daniel Galouye book ""Simulacron 3,"" first published in the 1960s. ...High-tech and hippie-dippy philosophies go together about as well as chocolate ice cream and brown mustard."
Maybe it's about time Murphy fired his agent and tried reviving his career.
Totally bizarre and ultimately without much point -- Godard's message about commercialism is drowned in a sea of oddity.
A mild and bland slapstick Disney comedy.
"130-minutes of unfocused, supernatural-themed sludge."
"Oddly underpowered, anticlimactic and torpidly acted ..."
What remains troubling about the essence of the premise&#44; regardless of its language and cultural context&#44; is that it insinuates the protagonist&#8217;s disposition for good and kindness derives from his cognitive disability&#46;
"Anyone who has seen NPH host the Tonys or the Emmys may wonder if there is nothing the actor can't do. Well, he can't make his thankless role as straight man to tiny blue cartoons work."
It's a lot like hearing the play-by-play account of a heated game of bridge. Only not half as gripping.
"To explain the extreme, lingering stench of See Spot Run, it might be helpful to think of the movie itself as a dog."
[I]ts effectiveness as a character study and its purpose are pretty shallow.
"Weak acting, silly story, and totally incomprehensible."
"It's everything it ought to be: right-minded, well-intentioned, compassionate. But it doesn't rise above made-for-cable public service announcement, either."
"Mona Lisa Smile trades on the complexity of modern art, and the credibility of its artists, to dump reductionist versions of its themes into a Hollywood star vehicle."
"A wildly uneven and sloppily directed movie, full of clashing tones and undigested bits of superior films."
"The Desperate Hour’s broad, vague rendering of its characters is part and parcel of its troubling approach to its material."
There's promise here but also perhaps some uncertainty: ultimately it falls between the stools of realist rural drama and full-on horror.
"Too often in ""Sniper,"" Eastwood kowtows to our basic need to have clear-cut good guys and bad guys. And when Kyle makes the impossible shot, it feels (in the limited context of the film) like we've actually won something. We haven't."
"Does anything say ""patriotism"" like a lovely marble bust of Abraham Lincoln, smashed over the head of a wounded terrorist?"
Nothing in this cynical bit of claptrap feels remotely real.
"If you're looking for action, suspense, and horror, see another movie because Underworld: Blood Wars has none of that. What you will see is Selene and fellow Vampires stand around and complain while they talk one another to death."
We wanted Cheerios and got strained peas.
"If it weren't for Chow Yun-Fat, Bulletproof Monk would be shooting blanks."
"It's the holidays, and the third instalment of the Meet the Parents saga has arrived - not unlike the Ghost of Christmas Future - to provide us with a terrifying glimpse at a journey taken down the wrong path."
"This is idiocy from soup to nuts, devoid of any clever ideas, meaningful performances or memorable set pieces."
"The kind of mumbling, lank-haired, achingly self-conscious indie rom-com that gives mumbling, lank-haired, achingly self-conscious indie rom-coms a bad name."
"Alvin, Theodore, and Simon have the only good lines or recognizable emotions, with Jason Lee and David Cross straining to flesh out their cardboard roles."
"I've now seen all four of the movies in the ultra-successful Hunger Games series, I have to admit, I am still bamboozled."
"Antonio plays drunk like a man who has never been one, and Catherine speaks Spanish like a woman who wouldn't touch a burrito without rubber gloves and a surgical mask."
"I am allowed to say this, because I've been on both sides of the [fat-girl] fence: Phat Girlz, shut the f**k up."
"Wades through completely-invented, yawn-inducing, geek emo-drama before once again settling in for the stuff with which Jackson feels at home - epic CGI battles."
It's not internally consistent at all... Not entirely satisfying.
Chaotic and unfocused.
"If only the director had had the confidence to tell him to do 50% less, this would have been an excellent performance. Pattinson is well cast as a confused redneck."
160 minutes of this nonsense is at least 90 minutes of back story too many.
"It's very pretty and occasionally amusing but also dreadfully dull for long, long stretches."
"Redford confounds expectations, not politically but dramatically."
"The story exists mainly to provide reason and shape for the frenzy of carnage: constant, numbing, and in the film's view at least, occasionally funny."
"There is a very peculiar exchange of power going on between the fans of One Direction and the band, that makes the movie feel more than anything like a horribly grovelling, Mr Slopeish bow."
Anna is more a template for the concept of a spy thriller than an actual one.
"A cryptogram for those who have repeatedly ingested the eighty-six hours of The Sopranos, or who just remember its shadows and sorrows in their bones... suffers from a glum, contemporary look that drains energy from the frame."
"This must be why I'm single. Who wants to be with a guy who looks forward to the complications a significant other will add to my life? Why can't you complain your girlfriend, Fred?"
"No one could possibly be offended by The Hunt, because that would require it to contain at least one comprehensible idea."
"It's actually at its best when it's the most pretentious. Its loud and repetitive action sequences are impressive enough, but we've seen them all before."
Good intentions are sadly the film's only distinct strength.
"Much of the problem can be traced to the villains of the piece: The snakes in the establishment are a bunch of really old white guys. Now this may be true to life, but it's hell on drama."
"This PG-13 movie has been made for 12-year-olds who prefer frenetic action sequences to genuine emotions and real romance in a game-inspired fantasy heavy on dungeons, light on the dragons."
"The shot of Blart quietly crawling into a hostage situation inside the mall's bank and walking through a roped line is a moment of absurd grace, only it's shot with the vulgarity of a Crash Test Dummies commercial."
"A film that's fake-transgressive: eager to shock, but never to the point where it causes any lasting discomfort or makes any disquieting insight."
"Amusing in spurts, Gringo is easily shrugged off, probably because little about it seems plausible or pointed."
"It's a sad story without emotional impact, a fascinating subject treated in a mundane manner."
Feel free to skip the endless denouement.
Pixar's grown so metallic that having automobiles for animated characters becomes disturbingly apt
The leads can't lend either spunk or gravitas to what was already a preposterous yarn 50 years ago.
If only I could figure out what all this was meant to stand for.
Watching Justice League feels like looking at a photo in a wet magazine.
"While memorable in sometimes unexpected ways (1980 head Avraham Shalom's long unwashed nails), there is always the nagging feeling that any revelations are being pushed or sold a little too hard."
"It's not awful, but it feels tired, like it's just another in a long line of cookie-cutter movies about pretty people."
"[M]ost of Borg vs. McEnroe is all calm and composure that essentially falls flat. While it offers plenty of promise, it fails to hit the mark."
"This aging Goodfellas satisfies while you're there, but it doesn't stick with you like a real meal."
The chipper Hallmark-style storytelling doesn't allow room for anything bold or challenging.
Michael Keaton as a malicious tenant. Aren't you scared just thinking about it?
Stupefyingly formulaic.
A tiresome whimsy.
"For those who do not consider themselves to be among the Sex and the City faithful, this is a painful experience, perhaps the longest 148 minutes likely to be spent in a movie theater this year. Watching grass grow is more dramatically satisfying."
"I'm not sure that Jon Heder is a strong enough leading man, especially for this kind of material."
Robert Altman's paean to this behind-the-scenes process was affectionately dubbed The Company. Aronofsky's may as well be titled Army of One.
"If, as is believed in certain fringe circles, the world will come to an end in 2012, at least there will be no more movies like this one made."
"I understand that an 'elegant' drama requires a leisurely pace, but Up at the Villa crawls on its belly."
"These occasional injections of kid-friendly body-horror slapstick only serve to highlight the laziness of the rest of the movie-no one actually says, ""Well, that just happened,"" but considering the quality of the writing, they might as well."
"In a story so reliant on detail as the engine for character action, it's frustrating and annoying to see the film spiral down the gurgler because of a few (but crucial) lapses of attention to detail."
"A pretentious misfire that made me feel as if I had aged years rather than the two hours or so that had passed by. (Full Content Review - Violence, Sex, etc. - for Parents also available)"
"The absolute absence of intimacy, of psychology, of characters' self-revelation in thought and desire, is a failure of form and style as much as of content."
Avoid.
"As played by Ben Stiller, the character of Greenberg fails to transcend his abhorrent exterior."
"What I realized watching this was how much the Potter movies relied on the skill and charisma of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint. The actors here are introducing new characters from scratch, and so far they're not that gripping."
Anaconda suffers from one-dimensional characters and cliches.
At its best the series milks its inability to care much into absudist jokes -a blob of non-sequiturs where rules are made to be ignored and broken. But it's not often at its best.
"It's not good when you check your watch every 20 minutes during a 107-minute movie. It's bad when you think, ""Yeaahh, rrright"" almost as often."
"Even a handful of nice flourishes from director J.A. Bayona can't rescue [the] appallingly paced, nonsensical script."
"Brosnan and Thompson seem hell-bent on a good time, but Joel Hopkins' broad, lazy script is no sparkler."
"i katalytika akadimaiki eksistorisi toy, poy problimatizei me tin idiazoysa sadistiki tis hroia stin parathesi sokaristikon skinon bias dihos peraitero diereynisi toys, afinei to myalo soy na kykloforei kai na kanei syndeseis mono toy, me ton idio tropo p"
"Instinct is a serviceable entry on the actor's resume, but, as a credible psychodrama that pits a therapist against her imprisoned patient, it does a disservice to just about everyone else."
It is Zendaya vs. Washington in this exhausting two hander with good acting in a story trying to be like Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf but falling short script-wise.
Slick military faux-criticism
As stiff as it is sincere.
"Most of what's here is interesting enough to be valuable on its own right without quite managing to be ""good""."
"It feels a little lazy, like Dugan and Sandler didn't work hard enough to iron out the premise."
"It bored me, even with the chilling ending."
An insistently distancing if aesthetically pleasing Canadian production.
"'Safer at Home' is never the quarantine freakout drug ingestion teases, as intentions to rally against injustice muddle and derail an original plot that barely steadies the Screenlife realities under construction."
"This small, quaint comedy offers up a half-baked fantasy in a lush back-village setting. It's an amiable, unremarkable 92 minutes of wacky, dimwitted characters."
...only Hudson has been stumping the talk shows on this one. Hathaway appears to be hiding in her closet until it blows over and everyone gets back to remembering her previous film.
"Of course, there's no real story here, unless you want to hear the one about the self-obsessed filmmaker who thought this project would be cool."
"In trying to save itself, the Saw series got caught in a convoluted trap of its own making."
How much you enjoy The Art of Getting By will probably rest on whether you'd like to give its loafer hero a hug or a slap.
"Sometimes its violence is ultraheightened, disgustingly real. Other times it's so stylized as to be barely felt."
Fletcher shows no real talent for the dramatic scenes.
"An overlong, over-plotted, instantly forgettable entertainment sporadically enlivened by decent supporting performances."
"An action movie without suspense, a message without meaning; Catherine Hardwicke presents a contrived Hollywood adaptation you can probably live without."
"The Girl In The Spider's Web is nothing like the complex thriller I was expecting it to be, cramming far too much into its runtime and leaving me feeling dissatisfied."
"The plot is a litany of false or mistaken identities and opportune coincidences; it has the mechanics of farce, but none of the buoyancy."
Like an overstuffed Happy Meal with a deliberately deceiving nutritional guide.
"What Walsch's message ultimately amounts to is for theologians and consumers to decide, but this uninspired presentation certainly drains it of some mystery and risks turning his writings into the ultimate self-help guide."
"Woody Allen does it again: one more unfunny, terrifically out-of-touch comedy set in an almost unrecognizable upper-class New York, pristine and shiny."
"If I want to see a movie about a warm and cuddly guy with a white beard, I'll just pop Miracle On 34th Street into the DVD player."
"Fist Fight won't hurt the careers of anyone involved, but you'll rightly expect it to swing much harder, and ultimately it ends up settling for being just barely passable."
A disappointing and bland follow up to a comedy that deserved much better than a typical cash-in...
A baseball film that has its heart in the right place but struggles to generate laughs.
"The movie entertains, albeit not in a way that will induce you to tell all your friends."
"I found the original extraordinarily thin. So if a remake should be in the same mold as the original, this one hits the mark. It flunks the watch test and the laugh test."
The Seed is a sci-fi horror from writerdirector Sam Walker that is exclusively on Shudder which takes the vacuous world of a couple of Instagram influencers and their friend.
A poor man's Lords of Dogtown.
"From Kafka to Kipling, there's plenty of potential in the subject of species dysphoria, but Biancheri hasn't really figured out how to tap into it."
Bah humbug!
What you get in Chop Shop is a very good 12-year-old actor who simply cannot carry a 85-minute drama in which he is the center of every single scene.
Money Monster has no real fresh ideas in the realm of TV sensationalism or finance stagnation and it certainly flirts around with a bankrupt aftertaste despite Clooney's impishness and charisma in addition to Roberts's infectious charm and radiance
"Bohemian Rhapsody is... a ""[rotten] sort of cheese waiting on the shelf."""
"The interesting ideas and ""trust no one"" atmosphere, sadly, cannot save CAPTIVE STATE."
"It's a space opera that despite having tiny periods of digital surprises, it runs out of steam. [Full review in Spanish]"
Charismatic turns from Sebastian Stan and Dominique Tipper can't save this swollen romantic dramedy.
"Those of us who crave some relief from multiplex conformity and studio imperialism can laugh at some of the jibes in this silly film, but we know that Waters is not an alternative, just an ancillary attraction."
Spirit's lesson of bravery is also a worthy one for children -- and adults -- to remember in a troubled world. If only Spirit's filmmakers had found a different way to deliver the message.
"Painfully awkward, melodramatic and contrived. Skip the movie and just buy its uplifting soundtrack."
More travesty than tragedy...doesn't so much re-imagine Shakespeare's tragedy as trivialize it.
This adaptation of EL James's BDSM potboiler struggles to make a spanking cinematic silk purse out of its notoriously tin-eared source.
"A chore to sit through, delivering an insipid story, overly emphatic performances, and complete lack of scares, playing to pushover crowds with the weakest production effort possible."
"Slow, stately, and boring."
Insufferable in almost every way.
"Throughout its two-hour-and-forty-minute runtime, I found myself alternating between feelings of disgust over how one might perceive these situations and feeling enrapt by the forceful way Zahler tells his story."
"""Do you have to film everything?"" That's the opening line of dialogue in The Gracefield Incident, the first feature film from Mathieu Ratthe, which, over the course of 90 minutes, never properly answers that question."
If you buy into the farcical nature of the tale&#44; you might find yourself having as much fun as the folks who made this flawed but good-natured affair&#46;
"What it lacks in originality, it almost makes up for with strong performances ..."
It's really pitiful.
"Frustrating, at times feeling amateur, a waste of a terrific cast."
If the title of the film was meant to be ironic then Escalante's parody has fallen on deaf ears and blind eyes.
"With its catchy, one-word title and colorful cast of characters, Basic is just begging for a sequel: Basic 2: Explaining the Unresolved Plot Points of the First Movie."
"It's an approach that yields additional pathos, but at the expense of dramatic momentum; dispensing with all the shoe-leather sleuthing results in two-plus hours of demands for justice and accountability being politely stonewalled, over and over again."
...too clever for its own good. Once you catch on to the gimmick...it isn't half as entertaining.
"A pastry of a movie, airy, insubstantial, and meant to fill in the gaps between heartier meals."
"Alternately rancid and ridiculous, strident and sickly sweet, Our Family Wedding offers plenty that's old, borrowed and blue; it's the something new that's missing."
"So sloppy with sentimental goop, unsuspecting audiences should be warned not to sit too close to the screen."
A well-intentioned biopic about disability crusader Richard Pimentel that starts strong but eventually collapses under its weighty sense of responsibility.
"The law of diminishing returns catches up with Sacha Baron Cohen in The Brothers Grimsby, a spy comedy in which Baron Cohen tries to outdo his past outrageousness but gets fewer laughs."
"Ho hum. Another week, another grossout teen comedy."
"I'm sorry, but no. There's not much to this second 'Coming.'"
"Hillcoat brings stray moments of style and surprise to ""Triple 9"" but not nearly enough to save it; for every twist you don't see coming, there are five you probably will."
"So unrelenting in its manipulative sentimentality that, if it had been made by an American and shot in a more conventional manner, it would be seen as a bad joke."
"It's machine-tooled for the horror fanbase: brash, slick, yucky -- by-the-numbers stuff."
"A creepy, depressing and leering 'comedy' that's a virtual collection of 'What were they thinking?' moments."
Bohemian Rhapsody might have some spectacular moments but it never forms a cohesive whole or have anything of merit to say about its subject.
"Cheeky and underwhelming, quickly to be filed under 'forgettable films.'"
"Kroc wasn't just a colorful character. He was the symbol of a national shift - from Main Street modesty to Wall Street arrogance. That's worth talking about in depth, and ""The Founder"" won't."
"If an odd-couple comedy is unequivocally what you seek, I'd recommend -- by a hair -- going to check out the other guys: Steve Carell and Paul Rudd in Dinner for Schmucks."
"It was fairly terrible back in 1987, and probably terribly fair by 2020 standards."
"It is just possible that there is a snappier, less derivative little thriller somewhere inside Wilde’s movie. Like the inhabitants of the Victory project, however, it is in dire need of liberation from its gilded, airless prison."
"After seeing this, I can understand why it has been gathering dust on a shelf somewhere for the past two years."
"The Prodigy is unremarkable compared to standouts like The Exorcist or even The Omen or Child's Play; its pace, dialogue, and 'twists' are all problematic even standing alone"
"Truly, it's hard to care that much about these bad people, or the lightning-belching cloud of debris swirling above Midway, or whether Jared Leto's Joker is disturbing or distracting."
This Compass points to the end of a would-be franchise.
"There's a crazypants crime movie and the damaged-people-find-each-other relationship movie, but together, it's a jambalaya that doesn't work."
"When the script veers into Sparks' slap-in-the-face melodrama, including two natural disasters, the movie drowns in corn syrup."
No doubt I thoroughly enjoyed it in another universe.
You will be longing to guzzle a bottle of Pepto-Bismol after being subjected to this 90-minute sap- and crap-fest.
Instead [Joris-Peyrafitte] spends so long framing it as the story of a comic-book-reading teenage boy obsessed with his long-absent father that watching it feels like queuing up for a dull theme park ride into the past.
"It wants to be something grand, but its ambition far exceeds its reach."
"This is a satire that's too afraid to put anyone off, and the result is surprisingly anodyne."
"That a Marilyn Manson song plays over the end credits should clue you in to the sort of hip, faux-Fincher ambience for which From Hell strives."
"Sometimes, improvements aren't always necessary whether that be for romantic partners or for a film."
"The dullest film you will ever see about forbidden love set against the most violent and volatile period of modern history, happening in an unspeakably beautiful house."
Sex domination fantasy is graphic and violent.
"About one commanding performance, fascinating to watch but not strong enough to redeem the muddled story line on which it hangs."
"Lugubriously slow and inert, Match Point simply drags without those customary Woody Allen one-liners . . ."
A car wreck at the intersection of Woody Allen and Kaufman.
Lisbeth Salander deserves better than this half-baked film.
If there were as many scares as there were phony decapitated heads we may have had half a movie here.
"Unbroken doesn't penetrate the surface of emotions, remaining a slightly detached, albeit respectful, representation of a potentially touching and inspiring true story."
"All these characters and story threads feel sketchy and incomplete, as if Curtis had written four or five dead-end drafts on one theme, then decided to try combining them all."
Shanley apparently accepts everything about the world. How can an artist accomplish anything on such a basis?
Bloody and profane.
"Light as a feather, the movie is at times a modest pleasure, but inconsequential."
"The film, a rambling love-letter to Weber's favourite doggy, True, crudely interweaves the photographer's usual obsessions - tough, shirtless boys and faded Hollywood stars - with meaningless ruminations how, like, war is really bad."
This is much more boring than a film called Pride And Prejudice And Zombies has any right to be.
"Though it faithfully follows the original's plotline, Leterrier's slick entertainment is anything but a throwback--just a concession to the Jerry Bruckheimer school of fast, cheap, and out-of-control visual effects."
"To describe the rollicking mayhem of ""The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard"" as over-the-top would be an insult to the concept of having a top."
"The only big question you may be asking yourself after watching this will probably be ""What could [fill in the name of any of the talented people inexplicably involved here] have possibly been thinking when they signed on?"""
"It just feels like Sony really wanted to get a sequel out, rushing a lot of elements and making the end product feel disposable."
Simply the latest in a string of pointless low-budget exercises in angsty Big Apple self-reflection.
"The plot is a bunch of nonsense, an excuse to parade the actors in front of the camera ..."
"There's nothing pleasurable about the noise, aggressive cutting and assaultive, comic-book action."
Members of the class of '80 struggled to stay in school despite homelessness and crime; the greatest crisis in '09 finds a student's Sesame Street work schedule affecting her GPA.
"By letting star power and commercial considerations warp good storytelling judgment, Roos has shortchanged his own movie, not to mention the audience."
"O relacionamento entre os personagens de Sarrazin e Scott  uma boa base para o filme, mas este se enfraquece com a subtrama romntica envolvendo Sue Lyon e desmorona de vez em seu terceiro ato que busca o drama."
&quot;Spirit Untamed&quot; is a forgettable entry in the Dreamworks Animation canon &#8211; notable only for its connection to the original film&#46; While I can&apos;t vouch for the quality of the Netflix series&#44; this film doesn&apos;t feel like it has a place on the big screen&#46;
"Though Lohan doesn't embarrass herself in a film in which she appears in virtually every frame, this tepid tribute to girl power hardly represents a step forward from Lohan's breakthrough roles."
"It offers a compelling, complex portrait of the Wikileaks founder that will probably do precisely what the actual Assange fears - namely, paint him as a demagogue whose commitment to institutional corruption is more self-aggrandizing than sincere."
I'm not offended by its singular lack of energy or invention - I never expected more than a cinematic Big Mac when I saw Eddie Mur-phy's name above the title 'Daddy Day Care.' But what I got was a sandwich from a gas station.
"Its murky storyline, phalanx of hard-to-distinguish characters, and glacial pace leaves the impression that both Haneke and the Academy can do better."
Fails to provide enough action and story that doesn't shy itself away from falling to the tropes of a generic summer blockbuster.
"Gandhi, My Father weakly opts for lionization at precisely the moment it should go in for the killshot."
"A choppily edited, poorly timed mess with little continuity, overloaded with aural shocks in a desperate attempt to compensate for its minimal suspense."
[A] finely honed yet utterly pointless remake.
Even likable star Zach Braff can't salvage this clunker.
Stallone Can't Choose Between Thoughtful Meditation of Age and Violence or Just a Cheesy Throwback to the mid-80's. A Pity.
"It could have been worse--in the original graphic novel, the authors created a villain fashioned solely out of fecal products. Even sans Mr. Stool Head, this project stinks to high heaven."
"The style mishmash - also including a bit of Mad Max - doesn't coalesce into anything substantial, nor do the flashy attempts at transgression and political commentary amount to more than insipidness."
"As Sorkin's loquacious heroine engaged in rapid-fire exchanges with her whip-smart lawyer (Idris Elba), I could almost hear the clickety clack of the writer's keyboard."
"Few of the characters have any recognizable impulses, except for greed, lust, and rage, so the brutality is only in service of itself."
Less about Shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw Quentin Tarantino's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations.
I'm guessing this film will haunt Haley Bennett's potential acting career for years to come.
"It might have fared better as a TV mini-series, where novelistic plot strands can be unpacked at length. McGregor is simply wrong for his role: He's too young, too modern, too smart."
"Film koji se mo%u017Ee usporediti s Giglijem, holivudskim gnojivom koje i dan danas izaziva traume kod filmofila"
"There's a good, snappy screwball comedy buried somewhere in the movie, but director Michael Dowse can't unearth it."
"Unfortunately the explanation is full of holes, and anyway less than interesting."
"The VFX team do an impeccable job bringing the animals to life; however, the film's lowbrow sense of humour reduces the elegance of the visuals."
"[Gummo] can offer some isolated, poetic moments of weird beauty. Still, it's hard to imagine who'll want to sit through Gummo waiting for those moments to arrive."
"I'm sure the producers of Angela's Ashes meant well, but they got the wrong guy to direct it."
The main flaw with The Meg is that it feels as if it should be having more fun than what it delivers
"The impressive-sounding cast only temporarily distracts from a plot riddled with holes, clichd dialogue and fight sequences too reliant on quick edits."
"Essentially, the movie feels like a one-night-stand that's overstayed its welcome."
[A]n occasionally entertaining though ultimately mindless action outing that's needlessly drawn-out in places.
Anemic&#44; clunky&#44; overwrought&#44; and so saccharine that it could give you a cavity&#46;
"This tasteless, formulaic, mainly unfunny, but otherwise harmless romp was scripted by five people and is served up like meat and potatoes by hack director Arthur Hiller."
Bacon's performance in Saw creator James Wan's laughably extreme revenge thriller Death Sentence is six degrees of ham.
"Here, [Woo] has to deal with visual chaos. And he doesn't do a good job of it."
"Lacking the same smarts, sass and scientific complexities as the original, there's nothing signifying why it needed to be brought back to life."
"It's too bad that Chastain's heady, exquisitely subtle performance is dragged down by the laughably vehement male characters that seek to speak for her."
"The most perverse thing about Zodiac isn't that its Hollywood's umpteenth serial-killer flick, when such crimes are rare in reality. It's that Zodiac, though based on actual crimes, is one of the dullest of these films to date."
"The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones is dark and flashy, yet soulless and derivative."
"The saddest ever Regency cosplay. Behold, a tableaux of thespians who shall teach us about the Corn Laws! Well-intentioned this would-be epic may be, but it's dull and dry as dirt."
"Unlike the movie version of Chris Kyle who never makes a mistake, Eastwood and his writer are prone to flubs that cost them their ""fog of war"" stance."
"Oh, not another one last job movie!"
"We don't need a movie reinforcing that high school is the best time in your life because it's not. If it was for you, get out there and do something more."
Indisputably bargain-basement aside from the casting of Mackenzie Astin.
Cas & Dylan may have big-name talent for a small Canadian movie but mainly it has tired Hollywood formulas.
"This movie is not funny, not even a bit."
"A $100 million cult movie that some fans may adore--if they can stomach the changes; but despite the visual virtuosity, it will bore many if not most of the uninitiated."
"The filmmaker has boiled it down to make it practical and watchable, and adapted ""Berlin Alexanderplatz"" to make it topical. But he's lost much of what made it special."
Big Momma's House is as uneven as the readout on a binge dieter's bathroom scale.
"As far as minor triumphs go, at least Story's disposable film is shrewd enough to understand, embrace, and then stay true to its iconic comic book source material's lighthearted spirit."
"Resident Evil: Afterlife is loud, boring, derivative, has zero tension and is the kind of movie that could only possibly be liked if the viewer has never seen any other post-apocalyptic zombie flick."
"You can't focus on the story, the actors, the acting, the chemistry or the dialogue. It's like there's no safe place to rest your eyes."
"It lives up - or rather down - to its title, sending its stars on a hedonistic road trip with a pink Mini Cooper's worth of sexist, racist, homophobic and ugly jokes for company."
"There were great moments, but this is definitely something you don't need to watch at the theater...I wasn't all that interested in it, and I don't want to play into Ted Bunny fever..."
"It's covering ground that's been covered and covered, offering little that is revelatory."
"So how many exes and children does Robert De Niro have to support, anyway? It's one of the things you could think about while enduring the abysmal Showtime ..."
"In a long summer of mediocre, effects-laden action pictures, Cowboys and Aliens is one of the most mediocre of all."
"Could've used less of Sandler's childishness and more of someone willing to push it in a darker, more dangerous direction."
"There's nothing here to engage the viewer or make them care one iota about what's occurring on the screen, making it no wonder that this got dumped into theaters in the middle of January."
"The sixth instalment in the Transformers movie series is the best yet, but that is not saying very much because of the low bar set by the other five."
"The bottom line: Kids may be mildly amused by The Nut Job, but adults accompanying them won't find much to capture their interest."
It's possible that no movie about music has ever treated its songs with more indifference than Clint Eastwood's Jersey Boys.
The film boxes itself into a simplistic turn of phrase that grows quite annoying as time passes.
An 85-minute flick that feels like a 150-minute smorgasbord of arty horror tropes...
"The clunky sporadic brilliance of yore is gone; in its place is a big, slick, hollow juggernaut, slathered in nostalgia, sentimentality, and a hollow winking irony meant to substitute for humor or ideas."
A new low in lame spoofery.
Self-indulgence from a Hollywood power couple can make pretty much anything they want. You should see pretty much anything else.
It was just a matter of time before Michael Haneke and Franz Kafka crossed paths.
"Although this film could've been hilarious, almost every scene ends up as crude or just plain silly. But Adam Sandler looks terrific as Zohan!"
"August: Osage County is a mess, an overcooked movie-star stew that never quite coheres into a movie."
The artful grunge is gone -- and so's the edge. The whole movie is bright yet colorless
"This film's bleak and murky vision, and somewhat incomprehensible spiritual mumbo-jumbo storyline, just didn't do it for me."
This film is the return of a Ford Mustang and a grudge match between Adonis Creed with the son of the man who killed his father&#44; Viktor Drago&#44; is predictable and you wonder if these two would be in the same division&#46; 
Estevez's plan to honor RFK feels more like exploitation of the footage to give his movie energy and an emotional context it doesn't otherwise have.
"Failed though it may be as serious fare, 'The Man Who Cried' remains a guilty pleasure"
"You know how some people try to cram 48 hours into a 24-hour day? Well, those people now have a movie to call their own."
The film tries for a kind of pawky comedy that tells some kind of truth. But a mediocre screenplay doesn't help and only a few moments work as well as they might.
"To keep it simple, the film is very dull and dry."
"Despite Blue Valentine's blatant sensememories of nakedness and affection, irritation and itch, what Gosling and Williams reveal about their own concepts of heterosexual experience is ultimately inane."
You can feel the production and overall plan seeping into the storytelling in ways that Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness doesn’t entirely have the strength to overcome.
"With an agonizing rupture of craft and common sense, it showcases a performance of screaming, over-the-top hysteria by Nicolas Cage that must be seen to be fully believed, but that is not a recommendation."
"We may have all wanted to know the story behind those famed horns, but the mystery was far preferable to having Maleficent defanged and declawed in the process."
"presented people who were so devoid of personality, humor and interest that I didn't care if any of them made it out alive"
"The depiction of everyday life at the orphanage is far more compelling than Vanya's personal quest. It's unfortunate that once the Italian hits the road, The Italian loses its way."
It's what a Nicholas Sparks movie would be if it were aimed at grown women rather than teenage girls.
"Has a dusty, encyclopedic feel to it."
"The movie is not objectionable - it's very affectionate, and has a light comic tone - but it is insufferable. Tweeness and whimsy eclipse any spark of thoughtfulness. The resulting confection is two hours of drama-less self-congratulation."
"At certain points in the middle of it, you may think ""I'm miserable now,"" though not in the way that Morrissey had in mind."
Fans in need of a Pacino/De Niro hit can just watch the coffee-shop scene from Heat again: it's 20 times cooler and 80 minutes shorter.
"Safari is fine, as in it’s just fine but also totally unnecessary wheel-spinning. "
"...slow, predictable, woodenly acted, and utterly preposterous."
One of Spielberg's worst movies. [Full review in Spanish]
And thus does a summer that started with a silly car chase picture end with a far sillier car chase picture
"Is there a point? No. Will you like it? Perhaps, but if you do... you should see someone about that."
"This repackaged plot is being released as""Eagle Eye, a ""new"" film from the team that brought us the similarly overrated and shamelessly derivative Disturbia."
"After a while, it all starts to feel like a showreel for the film's special-effects team than an honest effort to tell a story."
The problem isn't the material but the sheer volume of it.
A juvenile jerk-off session of battling machismos.
"It's just not at all satisfying, even if it does have its head in the right place and comes with a powerhouse of great jokes."
"The story is both unwieldy and nonsensical, spending, as it does, far too much time on the annoying Ukrainian, complicated plot twists and dialogue."
"For all the arresting visuals, Svankmajer's morose depiction of the blurry line between madness and sanity is surprisingly pedestrian."
Contains severe bouts of tedium!
the flimsiest comedic premise of Carrey's career
There's not enough of Robinson's back story to convey the full drama of his place in history.
It is nothing short of maddening to watch them wait endlessly rather than actually take active agency toward their predicament.
There is not a single lifelike character in the entire picture.
"At least ""Justice League"" had at the decency to be short"
"with Turteltaub making slow and delicate dabs on the canvas, in the apparent belief that he is painting his masterpiece, The Meg is a lousy combination of idiotic and self-important."
"When a cranky older woman meets a plucky younger woman, it's a safe bet that formula will prevail."
"After a certain point, the movie becomes our own cinematic damnation from which there is no escape."
"Given its retro style and multiple borrowings, there's nothing remotely forward about this rearward-facing flick. Those seven scribes aren't exactly practising what they're preaching."
...has about the same amount of depth as an article from 'Boy's Life.'
"Finally, the martial arts genre gets its own version of ""City Heat."""
"A muddled movie that delivers a gawky, unbelievable love story, tangled among a lazy intellectual debate, marinated in an abundance of sentiment and nostalgia."
"Bridget may have gotten older and wiser, but her movies have stayed the same."
"Bird Box doesn't allow viewers to invest much in its cast. In this case, an ominous atmosphere just isn't enough."
A rush job from filmmakers who should have left well enough alone.
A muddle of confused half-messages which reach for and fall slightly short of an admirable goal.
"As delightful as it is to see Tomlin, Fonda, Moreno, and Field together on the big screen, 80 for Brady is really a cinematic tribute to Tom Brady and how freakin’ magnificent he is."
Mr. Hanks performs with customary blankness and a woeful lack of chemistry with his hardworking co-star.
"In the end, Spectre is just too much of a good thing. Though each scene is carefully wrought, there's little grace, majesty, or romance in the way the pieces are connected."
This movie's many issues outweigh its attributes so significantly I can't help but feel like this will go down as one of the year's most frustrating disappointments.
"The film's real thrills are to be found in the fragility and confusion of Plummer's performance. At 85, few actors find leading roles and he's the oldest actor to have won an Oscar (for Beginners); he deserved better than this."
"It's a boring movie about a boring man, made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring."
"Zac Efron isn't a bad actor, but this kind of sappy movie will do nothing to build his credibility."
"One of those unfortunate movies where an enticing title fails to translate into onscreen satisfaction, Yakuza Princess is just unspectacular in every department."
"Despite all its exhausting striving, All the King's Men is simply not a great, or even good, movie."
"Lump this one among the lesser musical lights of The Studio Era, and move on."
"A very colorful French bonbon with no substance, and it might just give you indigestion."
Episode 38: Brightburn / The Perfection / Rocketman
"The real test of the film appears to be if you cast an entire troupe of charming actors, with McCarthy as the lead, and not include one laugh... will audiences still think they're watching a comedy?"
[Melissa] McCarthy must have gone shopping at the film stereotype thrift store to find the character.
Everything is a little on the nose and the burgeoning relationship between Paul and Tran is not interesting enough to sustain the social commentary. That is made worse when the story moves into an apocalyptic tangent in the third act.
"Uncharismatic in the extreme, [Davidson's] performance is entirely out of sync from the demands of Apatow's trademark lovable losers."
"Whannell's direction, as well as his construction of scenes, is, for the most part, of the straight-to-cable variety, taking portentousness for suspense and the illustration of facts for drama."
These are all cartoon figures out of Frank Capra's most feverish populist nightmares.
A stiff-upper-lip melodrama that's semi-spoiled by a disappointing bit of miscasting.
"The complexity of the character appears to be there for the writers, but Sazama and Sharpless peel away many potentially interesting problems."
Denis&#8217; listless and scattered approach&#44; a pair of mismatched leads&#44; and some unnecessary modern updates&#44; &#91;make this&#93; a curious misfire that even &#91;Denis&apos;&#93; most ardent admirers will have trouble defending with any degree of conviction&#46;
Paul Verhoeven's first Dutch film in 25 years is lurid and tasteless.
"This start for Gregory as producer and Laughton as director is rich in promise but the completed product, bewitching at times, loses sustained drive via too many offbeat touches that have a misty effect."
"As an act of creation, The Fountain is mostly about its creator. It is a reminder that obsessions are generally about the person obsessed and not the person obsessed about."
"The filmmakers hope for a fable-like charm rather than gritty credibility, but the whole thing feels as cynical as the villagers' convoluted mission."
One tedious slog of a movie.
"As clever as a copied-and-pasted Facebook joke, as original as an email forward from your grandfather's AOL account, The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard is a joyless turd that makes for a great sedative, despite everyone screaming every single line of dialogue."
'The Day the King Ate a Hot Dog' might be a more informative title for this wispy historical trifle...
"The writer-director Magnus von Horn keeps the nature of John's crime a secret from the audience for most of the film, which becomes an increasingly desperate and unlikely device."
"The metaphysical bores Cronenberg, and it shows..."
This Superman fails to take off
The film stalls out in moments of emotionally blas treacle that feels inelegantly forced into the proceedings.
"With a clipped and modestly entertaining 90-minute run time, The Polka King that relishes in Lewan's theatrics but rarely pauses to interrogate what's behind his facade."
"It just looks like a low-rent mishmash of Divergentand The Hunger Games, recycling riffs from Logan's Run with sets and costumes lifted from Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey."
Serious Moonlight has a backstory much more intriguingly dramatic than what's onscreen.
"The film follows the band down the bog- standard rock 'n' roll madness route, and the shallow script doesn't offer much of an insight into Joan or Cherie's personalities along the way."
Mike Judge Hasn't Got Over his Alliance with the Workers in Order to Make an Effective Flick about being The Man.
"""Memoria"" is more interpretive than informative. It toggles between having a calming effect on the viewer - you could hear audible snores in the theater - and disturbing when the loud sound catches us and Jessica off guard."
Scary&#63; Not a bit&#46; And camp value only takes it so far&#44; these days&#46; 
...this thing is cursed.
Let's not. And say we did.
It's almost like... no one has any idea what they're doing at all and just praying that the association with a classic Christmas pop song will pull them through. It doesn't.
"The script's very funny but with the exception of the charismatic Simon Phillips (as a nerdy vampire hunter), none of the actors seem to realise they're in a comedy."
"Von Trier supplies enough of an intellectual apparatus to give Dogville the veneer of art, but at its core this is a hollow, mean-spirited work."
"With a better lead and more inspired direction, Poolhall Junkies might have been decent entertainment. But Callahan the actor is the biggest liability in Callahan the director's film."
"Red Dawn suffers from a number of serious problems. The first, and most obvious, is that this is mini-series material compressed into a 95-minute movie."
"Penn hits too many of his thematic nails square on the head, never trusting that his audience is intelligent enough to get his message without all of that bold-facing and underlining."
feels largely meaningless and inconsequential
"Feig's sympathies toward young misfits are still thankfully evident, but the mature, realistic approach that made 'Freaks and Geeks' so refreshing is missing here."
"Some protesters believe that if you see this film, you'll go to Hell. They got it backwards. I think if you go to Hell, you'll probably see this film while you're there."
"The premise is sweet and innocent and the production is handsome, but the film moves slowly and doesn't really hold our attention."
"If you relish outbursts of weird Arnold pronunciation, the moment where he exclaims, ""Time to do the Looward's work"" is another minor classic."
Hanging with friends who utter phrases like 'selfish bowl of bitch sauce' and 'Sriracha hot' might be why the unpopular life is the only life to live.
"The potential of the plot is quickly dissolved by the dispersion present in the film, manifested mainly in irregular and disjointed sequences."
"All the tawdry behind-closed-doors shenanigans of a daytime talk show, but none of the excitement. It's as if the characters are as bored as we are."
"Anna Kendrick leads a more-than-capable cast, but both the script and the performances fall back on that bumbling, throw-away style familiar from TV shows such as The Thick of It and Veep and neither the humour nor the horror it's trying to expose..."
...another in a long string of Neeson revenge movies that do little more than make you wish he could just play his age.
"[Condemned] could have the twisted appeal of Cabin Fever, but by eschewing any sort of realistic character development, it fails to build any of that film's delicious tension and paranoia, leaving it with gore and goo and little else."
"...a ho-hum affair, always watchable yet hardly memorable."
[VIDEO ESSAY] Josh Whedon's sophomoric attempt at swimming in Kenneth Brannagh's waters of expertise - namely adapting Shakespeare plays to film - is akin to watching a wet cat lick itself dry.
"Its brooding ambience traipsing into a shallow narrative coma, there's much to be desired as concerns this mafia tinged love story of unexplained events and feelings."
"There's little in this pointless rehash to distract audiences from the pleasure of watching Tamblyn, a fine young actress whose direct, grownup stare belies her baby features."
Too many villains and too many heroes. The clutter is headache-inducing.
The movie is as blunt as its title.
A concept this goofy should be fun but... it just leaves a nasty taste in the mouth.
Gives the impression that a city council campaign in Seattle is followed by only a bunch of youths whooping it up.
Lacks focus or purpose with some really jarringly violent moments that stretch the boundaries of its PG-13 rating.
"Mawkishly adapted from Françoise Dorner's novel by Sandra Nettelbeck (Mostly Martha), the proceedings are so gentle that no dramatic momentum materializes."
"If only as a triumph of æsthetic perversity, perhaps, it should be seen. But not for any insight into the demons that spawned nightmares like the Columbine shootings."
"A forgettable, formulaic comedy so predictable that seeing it and skipping it are the exact same thing."
[Only God Forgives] somehow manages to use buckets of blood in the service of a plot with no pulse.
"It's a shame that ""Superman"" had to leave the eighties in such a disgraceful fashion."
"What you end up with is a better history lesson than drama, in spite of the obvious care with which Hanks brings the story of Greyhound to life."
"...Alfie - when you get right down to it - isn't a terribly likable character, something that certainly makes it difficult to actually care about his fate."
The eighth and latest chapter of the Fast saga hits 120mph on two flat tires ... Don't even get me started on the lack of Corona.
"It's neither fan service nor anti-fan service, just as it's not quite a sequel and not quite a reboot. Whatever it is, it's not much of a movie."
A lurid psychodrama cleverly dressed up in art house garb. It plumbs the recesses of pathetic and sordid human behavior with a wry combination of gleeful deliciousness and arty pretension.
"A big nothing, not even hokey enough to watch for the sake of laughing at it."
"May not quite be the entertaining and inspirational film that it aspires to be, but it does tell an involving and important story."
"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them turns out to be a hyperbolic name for a pretty so-so movie -- one with entertaining passages, but which mostly feels like a big-budget prequel to the better, more cohesive film that's yet to come."
"No one who wants to see this movie needs me to recommend it to them, but if anyone wants to know, I say stay home and rent one of those other movies on video."
"There's genuine fear in Keough's performance as a damaged woman grappling to contain her trauma before it destroys them all, but the movie places too much faith in her ability to carry the material through its aimless of cycle of freaky outbursts."
Beneath its color-drenched images and vintage wide-screen cinematography lurks a flatly written script directed with a lack of gracefulness and imagination.
An average film that never really quite works. [Full review in Spanish]
Unappealing mush.
"A low-budget affair, Tadpole was shot on digital video, and the images often look smeary and blurry, to the point of distraction. Then again, in a better movie, you might not have noticed."
Too much name dropping and tossing about of classical music submarine this light duty horror cartoon.
It feels like it's trying too hard to be over-the-top gruesome; I couldn't take it seriously. The splatter is icky but never quite horrific on any deeper level.
"""Blame"" eventually drowns in its shortcomings, but it does offer a clear look at Shephard's potential as a filmmaker."
"The pop culture phenomenon that resembles Star Wars much as the Prime Minister of Belgium resembles the President of the United States (respective box office ranks of these two films in their respective decades: 71, 1)."
How did this movie with Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn become so unfunny?
"Though there is little here for an informed person to take issue with, the film's well-intentioned preachiness is unlikely to win over those who favor Genesis and denial over climate science."
"Who is the star here, Neil Young or Hank William's guitar?"
"These are all good reasons to root for Carol as she becomes the newest member of the MCU. But Captain Marvel doesn't highlight any of them in a rousing, snappy way."
"This admirable, watercolor-delicate tale of individual feminist emancipation never quite blooms into living color, hampered by spotty casting and Richard Laxton's overly deliberate direction."
"It's dull, dull, dull."
...a well-groomed horror picture that offers a few good scares before devolving into psychological lunacy.
"It's a two-and-a-half hour movie. It needs to be good in its own right, not just setting up for the next episode. A two-and-a-half hour, $200 million set up?"
"Richard Curtis used to make this sort of thing look easy, but a good script is everything. Without one, it all falls embarrassingly flat."
Dustin Hoffman channels his Ratso Rizzo character from the 1969 Midnight Cowboy.
Swelling syrupy music and lingering shots draw out each and every triumph with numbing overkill.
An opportunity badly blown.
[Director Ladj Ly's] gaze tends to the spectacularity of Hollywood and the glorification of the mess as political discourse. [Full review in Spanish]
"[Union and Elba] are such expressive, extremely thoughtful performers. They have chemistry and they have class. What they don't have is a filmmaker who knows yet how to use either to make real movie magic. I'm rooting for him to figure it out."
"You may find yourself tickled, providing your toes don't curl up so far that they actually stab you in the heart."
"An odd little picture that finally provides some unsatisfying 'explanations' for all the previously, intriguingly inexplicable things that have gone before."
"Among Hollywood blockbusters Godzilla truly is a monster, an astoundingly crass and brutal factory product that tramples over the audience's hearts and minds. "
A failed film noir about a discontented man who wants something more in his life.
"It's not precisely terrible -- these are all talented people involved. It's just one or two degrees off from working, but those one or two degrees, with a project this high-wire, defeats it."
"Frankenheimer ... treats this trashy, disreputable material with a brute squareness so leaden and dour it's practically Teutonic."
It feels mostly like a merely functional film that misses the opportunity to be something special.
"Predictable Brazilian romcom has language, sex."
"Eat Pray Love has some decent performances and the occasional good moment but it's ultimately let down by a tedious, self-satisfied script, a shocking lack of humour and a criminally indulgent running time."
"Though this unabashedly earnest tearjerker doesn't completely transcend its narrative absurdities, it's enough of a distinctively odd duck to keep you engaged."
There's absolutely nothing of merit here to discuss other than its loyalty to the original source material.
"With two direct and developed lead performances from Michael Caine and young Bill Milner, it seems unfair to watch their efforts wasted on an uneven, unsatisfying picture like the tear-jerker Is Anybody There?"
"Laughable, not screamable."
You'll see nothing Ridley Scott didn't do better a decade ago and nothing 300: Rise Of An Empire didn't do with more style six weeks ago.
It's like someone got hold of all the wardrobe rejects from 'Boogie Nights' and built a movie around them.
"More sleazy than suspenseful, the film attempts to navigate some dark and morally complex territory while lacking the justification for doing so."
"Sweet and funny, this is more suitable for a TV movie than a big screen feature"
"Defying space and time, we will see one of the worse films of this year."
"The story, despite its nominally fascinating nature, never barrels forth the way it needs to. It plods. How a director as versatile and inventive as Cuarón managed that is a mystery greater than any found in the film."
"It has some warm and humorous spots, but not enough to overcome its many obstacles."
"The most objectionable thing about this film is not its crude humor or its cartoonish stereotypes, but the fact that it actually tries to deliver a moral with its story."
"There is camp comedy, although it is not clear how much of the silly stuff is intentional and how much is the result of the inept dialogue and abysmal acting."
"If this is love, no thanks."
The movie has so much heart that the poor overworked organ explodes in every scene.
"A dead end -- the mark of a superficial stylist unable to take anything seriously, including his own work."
"At its best, Mission to Mars is a visually inspiring motion picture that takes you to another world and shows off the amazing sights."
"Alien: Covenant washed over me and left me thinking, ""Eh."""
"A maddeningly mediocre, ineptly manipulative 'real-time' thriller. (A real-time thriller that's almost 20 minutes longer than its title suggests.)"
"Adjani somehow won the Best Actress prize at Cannes for her deer-in-headlights performance, although it's Smith who best conveys the desperation of her character."
"For a film so boastful about preserving history, it seems all too content to commercialise its own story."
The moments Stone and Weiser select to sketch Bush's character are more of a jumble than a natural progression.
...a well-intentioned yet catastrophically misguided endeavor...
"As a director, Kosinski is a great production designer. But as a dramatist? Not so much."
Embraces its R rating with all the self-restraint and self-respect of a teenage boy discovering a Hustler magazine in a neigborhood recycling bin.
"A better filmmaker would have given the material some kind of vertiginous rhythm, yet Liman just plods humorlessly, flavorlessly."
What's onscreen comes across as little more than home-movie footage of old acquaintances getting together now and again.
"Save a final swashbuckling sequence in which Crusoe and chums fend off pirates, there's nothing to match, say, that spooky moment when the hero finds footprints in the sand."
"At a 124-minute runtime, though, the writer-director has stretched a wide canvas, and only sporadically found anything worth filling it with."
RV is a road trip made by people who seem never to have taken one and are disinterested in anything that might happen outside their very narrow focus.
"Just wondering, but if these sisters are indeed capable of doing it for themselves as the film insists, why can't at least one of them do it without a man?"
"Takes itself very seriously, much more than the ridiculous story allows. [Full review in Spanish]"
"A loud, chaotic, overproduced comedy that's often more destructive than funny."
"Kids are not likely to get the jokes about Gary Oldman&#8203;'s wig in the 1992 film Dracula, nor sympathise closely with the emotional difficulties Drac faces in becoming a grandparent. Adults... will have seen virtually all of this before."
"Changeling isn't just a mess of manipulative attitudes like a Spike Lee film, above all, it's an extremely unpleasant experience."
"It's a film for those whose wits have been sharpened by endless reruns of The Twilight Zone, and filmed with a slick posh that foolishly passes for style."
An earnest and occasionally touching romantic drama that sweeps aside the devastating narrative potential of a traumatic brain injury to traffic in a more benign depiction of amnesia.
It might be time for Carrie & Company to hang up the ManoloBlahniks.
"A meandering movie that sometimes hits dead center and sometimes misfires dismally, resulting in a drama more tangled than taut."
"You have to stretch your imagination just a teensy bit - OK, a whale of a lot - to buy into it."
It's like a bad soap opera.
"As for the golden history and legend, they lie buried beneath this delayed replay of a primer on strategy."
Pet Sematary fails to tell a clever narrative that is truly disturbing but insteads falls into the same tropes that are in so many other horror films.
A hopelessly stilted political drama that plays like U.S. News & World Report: The Movie.
"As an action movie, ""Baby Driver"" is good, but as an action movie directed by Edgar Wright, it is disappointing."
"As for Coppola, she shows a lot of her father's audacity but as yet not much of his talent."
Eat Pray Love only superficially advocates independence and growth while serving up a steaming pile of pseudo-spiritual hyperbole.
Mainly coarsens 2001 in its mix of cosmic consciousness and 'naturalistic' product placement.
"The latest Wayans brothers head-scratcher, reaches the bar their last film set. Take that as a searing insult."
A person would have to have missed not only Chasing Liberty but every movie ever made to think First Daughter was a first in anything except its title.
"I have to confess I am getting quite sick of the sorcerer-style flashy and fiery effects so many of these comic book movies revel in. Mix it up next time, guys."
Minor curio about Rick Springfield's devoted fan base has less weight than a VH1 Behind the Music special.
"There's nothing here for me to love - excepting, maybe, the incomparable Michael Pena - but this isn't really a movie for 30-plus year-old adults. Kids get to have movies for themselves too."
Beauty and skill bereft of passion or personality.
"Pamela Anderson, Simon Cowell and a Michael Jackson clone - certainly some folks' idea of a good time but little more than an act of sheer desperation as far as I'm concerned."
"It's a shame that nearly everything in the middle of Stomp the Yard is so predictable, because the opening and closing dance competitions are filled with amazing moves and other surprises."
"The film repeatedly undercuts whatever tension is mustered with its frustrating tendency to crack goofy, juvenile jokes."
"With 'Alex Cross,' the script is filled with such a lack of suspense, that this cat-and-mouse film feels cliché and laughable. The team behind the camera didn't do Perry, in a non-Madea lead role, any justice."
Paxton's uneven directorial debut fails to unlock the full potential of what is in many ways a fresh and dramatically substantial spin on the genre.
The prerelease trailer foretold a pleasant throwback to the National Lampoon's Vacation movies; little did we all realize it'd be a Vacation that stupidly expects us to care for its characters.
"Drive Angry is such an outrageously overblown experience that it almost feels redundant to flag up its obvious shortcomings in the most basic areas: a hopeless lack of logic, dismal dialogue, characters with less personality than the average roadkill."
"In the absence of much dramatic heft, its complacent beauty soon wears off; set it against Rivette's La Belle Noiseuse, a far more rigorous interrogation of this dynamic, and it's but a lightly shimmering afterthought."
"Unfortunately, by adding cumbersome elements to the narrative, it ultimately detracts from the core human story and causes the viewer to leave the film dissatisfied..."
A maddeningly vague biography&#44; Frida is all the worse for starting off with such narrative promise and visual pizzazz before degenerating into boring&#44; episodic misery&#46;
A virtual big-budget explosion? Yes. A spectacle of three great actresses making fools of themselves? Sure. MTV-worthy martial arts monages that shamelessly rip off The Matrix? Yessireebob. But a movie? No. Not for an instant.
Confessions is no more than a painless time-waster. But the beguiling Fisher is well worth the investment.
"It is truly one of the worst movie musicals I've ever seen in my life, mind you, I'm a musical junkie for both movies and theatre."
"For about an hour it's a fine, ghoulish carnival sideshow, and that has its charms, but there's a thin desperation about the climax."
"This slick, soppy romantic ensemble has the snappy banter and skin-deep emotions of a television sitcom but the game cast make it passable if forgettable entertainment."
"While innocuously entertaining, Adult World is missing both substance and, at times, any mooring in reality."

"This time out, what's scary is how boring and unimaginative the series has become."
"The original is great, the sequel entertaining, the third one absolutely unnecessary."
Grim&#44; psychosexual fairy tales like &#8220;Pinocchio&#8221; can still be effective&#44; of course&#44; if the tellers respect the primal feelings and fears they evoke&#46; But if they hedge with warmth or whimsy&#44; the results curdle quickly&#46;
"Only people who have forgotten their own adolescence, or who are terrified of relinquishing it, could find it startling to discover that teenagers do things to shock their parents."
"This is an experimental horror film with 26 directors around the world each making a short film about death. Given the format, it is no surprise there are few hits and a lot of misses."
"The thing is, up until the final act the talented filmmaker with the signature rat-a-tat-tat dialogue style almost pulls it off."
The Departed has the sense of a 14-hour movie carved down to a fraction.

Ticket to Paradise is more staycation than vacation&#44; and as such it is equally as memorable&#46;
"tate of Play is a smoothly written, almost instantly forgettable procedural featuring people we have trouble caring about."
"At once exploitative and contemplative, thrilling and disgusting, the film makes a bloody mess of itself before coming close to solving its own case."
"The character of Bond always works best when a blank canvas of nihilist tendencies and ultra-professionalism, so the Batman-style stab at populist pathos didn't wash with me."

"A slickly refurbished relic, a flat bit of frothy formula that only nostalgia buffs could warm to."
"De Niro is not at his best playing nice - in fact, he's boring and so is the film. Actually, it's worse than that. It's pseudoredemptive tosh."
"The film is over-long, plot heavy, needlessly complicated and lacklustre, but the moments of dance and music keep it from being a total waste of time."
This monotonous film glorifies a relationship as romantic&#44; when it&#8217;s really a doomed love affair where one person in the relationship is very selfish and manipulative&#46; It doesn&#8217;t help that some of the acting in Firebird is very stilted and awkward&#46;
"Woody Allen is back to his old, tiresome formats with a minor-league comedy-mystery that's a cross between Manhattan Murder Mystery and Curse of the Jade Scorpion."
Ungodly stew.
Red Joan's sentimental exoneration of one woman's treason and sedition fits with how today's media pay tribute to the kaffeeklatsch of political resisters.
"Flees from anything that might involve real human emotion, or for that matter any credible human activity other than looking good."
What could have been regarded as a good monster flick turned into a biblical and preachy flick.
"Does it require a dirty mind or just a grasp of the obvious to suspect that the title of 'The Back-up Plan' was contrived to remind moviegoers of Jennifer Lopez's most publicized asset? (As Juvenile might say, 'Back that azzet up.')"
A lazily plotted excuse to set up gross-out gags 10 years in the future.
"I Wanna Dance with Somebody ultimately devolves into a boilerplate biopic, a series of increasingly unfortunate events presented with little narrative shape or texture."
Sutton remains too detached from the main character&#44; failing to connect to whatever humanity Baker is aching to find in his performance&#46;
"Ultimately, the fact it's all down to the, um, Devil, means all the other characters' dark secrets that come to light are a bit pointless."
It is to royal biography what those commemorative plates are to royal weddings.
Night at the Museum isn't an utter disaster but it is a dreary special effects-laden fantasy adventure with zero thrills and only intermittent heart.
Guy flicks can be just as galling as the chick variety.
"Harris has made a movie that's not entirely credible. And at times, it seems as if he's doing emotional heavy lifting for which he hasn't properly trained."
Hardcore Henry is fun enough but not in any way worth making yourself ill for an hour and a half.
"The push-and-pull between the rote royal-family intrigue and the feverish visual design is almost too much, nearly drowning the picture in a sea of self-generating kitsch."
"The film delivers the same misogynistic, faux-modernistic jolts of trashy humor and labored plotting that typify the work of co-producer Michael Bay."
"The producer's statement that ""a naked white giant, with his civilized sweetheart in his arms"" faced it all - ""it all"" being a faked picture of wild beasts devouring civilized sweethearts - is indicative of what you can expect from The King of the Jungle."
Something's terribly wrong when the most engaging character in a Sandra Bullock film is a female dog named Jack.
"The film's scarce glimpses of humanity should add up to more, but ultimately, Listen Up Philip leaves us wondering why we bothered to care."
"Dilemma rests on the same structural foundation as episodes of Three's Company, when Mr. Roper thought he heard shenanigans through the kitchen door. A simple conversation would clear things up."
"While Zemeckis, who co-wrote the film with Christopher Browne, makes sure the movie looks wondrous, most of the characters are campy caricatures, especially after Petit and company touch down in the Big Apple and mingle with the Noo Yawk folk."
"It's a sporadically interesting, mostly dull history lesson."
Penn gets bogged down in his own grand vision.
"Bullock turns in a terrific, ball-breaking performance. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is painfully patronising."
"In trying to be everything to everybody, it meant nothing much to me."
Lou Ye ... has chosen a murky and disjointed means to narrate this story.
"It's twinged with requisite boo scares, void of deeply complicated twists and often haphazard with basic logic."
Unconvincing.
"Almost all of the action takes place in the bedroom. There is certainly nothing wrong with that, but a little more character dimension would have made these between-the-sheet sessions a lot more charged."
"The technical achievements can't compensate for Cole's wet-blanket acting, Robbie's odd lack of charisma, and a script uninterested in sustaining viewer attention."
Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor is like a lavishly prepared six-course meal during which the host keeps telling us we would all be happier and healthier with a place of cold porridge.
Credibility and intelligence are pretty thoroughly battered.
High spirits are not enough in such enterprises. Even the Greek actress Melina Mercouri is not enough.
...bottom-of-the-barrel...
I&#8217;m happy to report that the movie does have its decent share of good scares and creepy moments&#46; Unfortunately&#44; they&#8217;re practically equaled by the amount of goofy moments and dubious dialogue&#46;
"Splice is actually very sympathetic to its monster. This sympathy actually works well for the story, though it is abandoned for a messy and clichéd finale, complete with a twist you can see coming from a mile away."
"Ana de Armas capably evokes Monroe, but authenticity is hardly Blonde's north star. It's a labyrinth of trauma-collapsed time, space and iconography."
A shoddy Sergio Leone 'tribute' filmed from a first draft by a director who lacks the discipline to match his talent.
The most consistent pleasures in this uneven movie are when Ferrell and Reynolds are onscreen together&#44; comically insulting each other&#46; 
"It's not that Kung Pow isn't funny some of the time -- it just isn't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves, without all Oedekerk's impish augmentation."
"""Pixels"" is proof that you should never give a good idea to Adam Sandler, for the same reason you don't let a toddler prepare an expensive lobster dinner - because it's wasteful and will end with an unpalatable mess."
"Undeniably easy to watch, the film still isn't very fulfilling, the aftertaste left by the over-familiar finale one I just didn't like."
"THE DIVIDE aims for a dark, cutthroat tone, focusing on exploitation elements without the thrills that are usually involved. The result is both extremely dismal and extremely uncomfortable."
"[Playing God is] this week's episode of 'Good Actors, Less Than Ideal Script.'"
"The movie's outline has some promise, but the movie itself is leaden."
"...a big, dumb movie built to make money but hardly worthy of serious examination. Avatar isn't only critic-proof, it resists serious criticism. You might as well analyze a beach ball."
"A ludicrous supernatural thriller, packed with clichs, heavy-handed symbolism, stupid dialogue and over-acting."
A weird combination of Jerry Bruckheimer action flick and cartoonish kiddie movie...far too flimsy and formulaic a farce to linger in anybody's memory very long.
"Logan and Beth's relationship feels dull and perfunctory, and Efron's attempts at playing post-traumatic stress disorder are laughable."
"An honorable movie that, on paper, I should love...almost a secular Passion of the Christ...[with] little more sense of Louis' psychology or inner life than Caviezel's Jesus."
"Bleak, brutal, pretentious, over-agitated and only somwhat suspenseful."
"Dramatically and structurally, the film doesn't quite know how to feel about John's story, and while presenting them in confusing visual terms, it leaves the result admirable for its committed performances, but also something of a mess."
The in-your-face documentary recalls the sensational tabloid story from the 1950s.
Larry Crowne has the air of a project locked in a drawer since 1993. They should have thrown away the key.
Hannibal Lecter does not need a creation story; he just needs to go away. The meal is over.
Even if you accept its age-old premise ... there's still too much other stupid stuff to get in the way of ever really enjoying the thing.
This film seems dangerously close to embracing the same kind of selective storytelling that it condemns.
The whole thing is supposed to run on a dream logic reminiscent of Jean Cocteau or Ingmar Bergman&#44; but rather than immersive or contemplative it&#8217;s just confusing and weird&#46;
"Derivative, predictable and unforgivably mediocre."
This jewel heist caper chapter is much more paste than polish.
"Appropriately enough, it seems that Brooks and Johnson needed a muse of their own to really make this film work."

"In Rashida Jones's documentary tribute to her own father, Quincy Jones, we see previous tributes to the legendary producer, which is just some next level redundancy."
"There's a lot of cool knives on display here, but the people doing the stabbing don't really matter."
Inferno is a two-hour travelogue that ultimately goes nowhere.
the least successful of a recent spate of ultra violent war films that ennoble the U.S. military
"Ken Russell would love this. In one scene, we get a stab at soccer hooliganism, a double-barreled rip-off of Quentin Tarantino's climactic shootout - and Meat Loaf explodes."
"J-Lo is back in the sort of breathtakingly abysmal thriller that, a decade ago, sullied a promising dramatic career."
"All these great actors, the majestic landscapes and picturesque and mysterious characters wasted... A Tarantino's mistake. [Full review in Spanish]"
None of it is funny. At all. Not even a little.
"Tintin's fantastic, charmingly naive little world is not well served by the epic quasi-realism of high-tech computer animation."
"Full of potential and very enjoyable in some places, but ultimately underwhelming."
"While the 1989 adaptation of Pet Sematary has gained a cult following, did I enjoy it? No. Was I more partial to this new iteration, perhaps? Also no."
Cruelly drab.
The 13th is full of accusations by opportunists-posing-as-historians who profit from reinforcing the fear that black Americans by and large have not experienced progress.
A well-intentioned love letter to wrestling that doesn't quite pan out. [Full Review in Spanish]
Só há uma coisa pior do que os habituais trejeitos (nada engraçados) de Adam Sandler: os roteiros que este escreve - e o segredo de seu sucesso nas bilheterias é um mistério maior do que o paradeiro de Jimmy Hoffa.
"Not for kids, and not for many adults, either."
Perhaps the problem is with Jones&#8217; directing&#59; Mr&#46; Malcolm&#8217;s List is stiff and lacks passion&#46; A film about love should not feel this clinical and pre-meditated&#46; 
A movie shouldn't rely on Hathaway and Ejiofor to shell-game your attention away from the movie itself.
I can honestly barely be bothered to remember what the point of the present-day part of the story even was.
"Cannon's appeal is overshadowed by both his vanity and the dull, by-the-numbers quality of the filmmaking."
Germans may indeed have overcome their grandparent's anti-Semitism. But their famously lousy sense of humor is still in full effect.
"[Nothing] will give you more respect for how difficult it is to be an actor than watching top talent like John Cusack, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Amanda Peet and Oliver Platt struggling to treat the film's ungodly language and situations with perfect seriousness."
"After two and a half hours, The Secret of the Grain, ends, as arbitrarily as it began."
"Even as a coven assembles, the movie forgets to scare."
The painfully pedestrian script by director Charles Dance takes you exactly where you think it will.
"America's opioid crisis would seem too dire a subject to receive shallow cinematic treatment. So it's ironic, then, that Spencer T. Folmar's thriller suffers from not quite being exploitative enough."
A rom-com with too much rom (winsome) and far too little com.
It's a romantic piffle stuffed with so much candy that your skin could break out.
"The comedy is some good moments, and the chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds is strong, but it's too cute and predictable"
There is nothing wrong with Bullock's performance but the storytelling here becomes increasingly incoherent.
"The most groan-worthy Bay moment comes early on when Megan Fox's journalist, April O'Neal, manages to find some reasoning to dress up like a nerd girl in a porn skit and a school girl with a hiked-up kilt--all in one scene."
"No, Johnny English Strikes Again won't win any awards but it will resonate with fans of the character and Atkinson's shtick."
"Contains no shortage of great actors, none of whom can do anything to distract from the film's horribly awkward pacing or the apparent visual indifference of its director."
"The film went through various writers, and script revisions led to contradictions and improbabilities."
"There is a vital, saddening and illuminating story to be told here, and unfortunately, it doesn't always get the chance to make itself heard."
"A high quality production, with strong direction, great acting, but ultimately not much crawling beneath the surface."
"Script feels rushed and is very short on character development ... most viewers will be baffled, feeling like they started at fourth or fifth episode in a ten-part production."
A Star Is Boring.
A join-the-dots parade of feel-good clichés. And not in a good way.
The Extra Man is a grating one-note comedy posing as something more.
"A Hallmark Channel holiday romance without the snow, aka ""insipid."
"Has all the values of a straight-to-video movie, but because it has a bigger-name cast, it gets a full theatrical release."
"There was room to surround the undeniably beautiful video-game scenes with moments of nostalgic wit, but Pixels is, unfortunately, mostly a long, dreary slog."
"The narrative applies Newton's famous law to charcaters that are in rest (more inertsia here), forced to move by an external stimulus. The acting is good, but overall a static, venetless feature."
"Despite doing a fine job telling this trajectory skateboarder bio, Stickler's tale lacked an edge and the power to make this story stick in the ribs."
"About as interesting as its lead. Which is to say, not at all."
"This mostly mediocre movie is a painless enough time-waster, thanks to slick production values and some impressive stunt work, but it never lives up to the potential of its premise."
I have a terrible suspicion that filmmaker Tom Six would be delighted to learn that someone in the real world had tried to create a human centipede.
A deadly dull and overly familiar movie about summoning ghosts that draws upon nearly every horror movie clich.
"The writing is lazy, the movie focuses on all the wrong things and the tone lurches unpleasantly between gum-soft comedy and lukewarm thriller."
For an absolutely unnecessary movie&#44; &quot;Hannibal Rising&quot; is handsomely appointed&#44; lushly if unimaginatively directed&#46;
"By polishing the edges off, ""Death Wish (2018)"" fails to distinguish itself. It's just another revenge tale, where the deafening sound of gunfire neatly ties up all the loose ends."
"All I can do is give Uglydolls points for trying. Unfortunately, it's just not enough."
The jokes work well enough that it's a real shame HOW TO BE SINGLE defeats itself in all its meandering.
"Self-consciously righteous about its agenda, admitting the darker sides of its heroes while in the same breath justifying their brutality, it's a workmanlike period manhunt film made noteworthy only by the names of its villains."
"Heinzerling chooses to focus on the couple and their art, but it unfolds too slowly and at times it feels like the film has a lack of focus, altering between showing us their art creations and their rocky relationship without a balance."
"""Grudge Match"" at its core is an affront to the cinema gods, an attempt to capitalize off two iconic films for a few cheap laughs."
An unauthorized David Bowie biopic without the music begs the question&#44; what&apos;s the point&#63;
"Blue is the Warmest Color makes a more mundane case too, that this film, for all its claims to truth and truthful fantasy, is shaped by limits, whether or not it acknowledges them."
"For the most part this is a tedious, badly written, poorly paced and borderline incoherent thriller that should probably have gone straight to DVD."
Your movie's flashback sub-plot shouldn't draw attention to how dull your actual central plot is.
"Slower moving, with fewer killings and effects, Craven's new film is unlikely to draw the crowds that made Nightmare a box office phenomenon. "
There's no unironic value to this.
"""She's Funny That Way"" is manufactured, sweet and unpretentious, but like candy floss, we got tired of it before it was done, and it contains next to no nutritional value."
"Be sure to say ""I don't"" to License to Wed"
"Despite the long shelf time and the staggering amount of money lost, this is not one of the all-time cinematic disasters."
"The Dead Don't Die does not bring with it anything revolutionary, although it does have Jarmusch's sardonic touch. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Australia is sloppy, way too long, has awful dialogue, some bad special effects and very annoying characters."
"A fairly straightforward, conventional superhero story, where a mere mortal gathers the ability to be extraordinary and then becomes a hero. This is no way to sell me on a story about a guy who can make himself the size of an ant."
"One wonders how the movie might have played as pure, unceasing battle scenes, allowing the combat to define the characters; with real soldiers doing the onscreen fighting, something special may well have emerged."
Across the Universe serves up a handful of brilliant music videos badly strung together by a lame narrative that borrows heavily from Hair.
"Despite fine performances by Aaron Eckhart and Ben Kingsley, 'Suspect Zero' is a painfully muddled crime thriller."
"None of the stars are trying very hard, and so the most memorable presences are the cameos: If nothing else, Grown Ups 2 will go down as the only film in history to find room for Steve Buscemi alongside ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin."
"It's all mapped out in such a simple, obvious fashion, there's virtually no way to find it interesting."
"Can Michael Douglas still command attention at the fore of an action film? Yes%u2026 but it's perhaps the only interesting facet of ""The Sentinel."""
"Pet lovers may recognize and enjoy some of the behavior - a cat coughing up a hairball on her sleeping owner and the protective nature of Max and Rooster - but it won't beat spending the day with your real-life, cuddly pet."
"Not quite a satire, not quite an homage, Jawbreaker falls into a third category: audaciously unoriginal."
"[An] eminently predictable, indifferently shot after-school special."
"Shanghai Noon isn't the worst film of the year. But, for me, it may be the most disappointing."
The outer space setting is mere decoration for an insanely expensive variation on ancient rom-com templates.
"Antisocial, semipsychotic toddlers treated as amusing? Check."
"When screenwriting manuals and college courses admonish aspiring filmmakers to use narration sparingly, if at all, and to show rather than tell, they're talking about movies like the dreadful new quirk-fest Better Living Through Chemistry."
Oh for the days of Tommy Lee and Will. Hemsworth and Thomson do not generate the chemistry or comedy necessary for a successful reboot of this series.
Everything pales next to the spectacle of Hayek barnstorming through this story as if it were her Mildred Pierce.She emotes the way Vesuvius erupts.
It's the standard corruption-of-the-innocent routine.
"The movie flirts with ideas and then runs away from them, so ultimately, it's not much more than a dishonest, spectacular bore."
"Audiences out for a movie that won't make them think might be able to enjoy this, but aside from the fabulous Harris and some beyond-mindless violence, there isn't much to see here."
"This is an amiable, literate but prosaic U.S. indie movie."
"If you're looking for action, suspense, and horror, see another movie because Underworld: Blood Wars has none of that. What you will see is Selene and fellow Vampires stand around and complain while they talk one another to death."
Craven throws away most of what made the first film shocking and relevant&#46;
"Where the Wild Things Are is audacious in its refusal to be reassuring, which makes it hard to love, but also hard to dismiss."
The movie's just an acceptable way for youngsters to kill two hours at the mall until their parents pick them up.
"Gritty and action-packed, but often contrived and monotonous while lacking enough of a heart and brain to be a truly suspenseful and engrossing Russian gangster film."
"I Am Not An Easy Man has some winning portions in the strong comedic moments and Ferdane's spectacular performance, but ultimately its interesting concept goes nowhere."
I'm afraid I couldn't quite see past the oddness of its conceit: to redo Blue Valentine with songs.
"As junky and disposable as most Besson productions, From Paris With Love is insomniac viewing, coming soon to a 2 a.m. pay-cable slot near you."
"Who is Uwe Boll and why does he hate moviegoers so? The German hack, the one-man Blitzkrieg of Bad, is the worst filmmaker in the movies today."
"Hopkins at least has fun hamming things up, but the film around him simply goes through the motions."
Approximately 10% of you are going to LOVE this movie.
Never funny enough to pass muster as a comedy and never scary enough (if at all) to make it as a horror movie.
Some call it realism; I'd call it exploitation.
Were it not for the presence of Hugh Grant&#44; Guy Ritchie&#8217;s awkwardly titled international crime thriller would be easily forgotten&#46;
Plays less like The Twilight Zone than a Bizarro World Lifetime Channel Movie of the Week.
"In striving for inspiration, Fun with Dick and Jane discovers moments of cleverness, but there aren't enough of them, nor are they sustained."
"Are you sure Guy Ritchie didn't direct this??? The attempt to make a faster and furiouser Robin Hood ain't all that , although it IS better than King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword but that is not saying a whole lot."
"It's a beautiful film, but in the end, Despereaux is esthetically charmed but dramatically inert."
"'I'm very unhappy with the film,' the director recently told an online magazine. Join the club."
Madness is one of the last adjectives that come to mind when describing Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness
"Isn't that bad, but certainly isn't that good, either."
"Now, after that brief time out for a breath of honesty, Adam is back to lining his pockets again."
"The film is overly long, has its vantage point changed too often, and proves more confusing than entertaining."
"Gibson is a primitive all right, but so were Cecil B. DeMille and D.W. Griffith, and somehow we survived their idiocies. Doubtless there will come a day when he joins them in the Valhalla of the vacuous."
"Hey buddy, if you don't like it here, go and live in Russia (or its 21st century equivalent)."
"It pains me to say it, but as far as I can see it's an extended and slightly better crafted example of those fake 'reality TV' shows."
Reminded me of a picture of a beautifully-drawn horse that turned into a stick figure by the end. 
Three Men and a Bomb!
...good actors are wasted on a clichd script.
"As with most recent animated features not affiliated with Pixar Studios, Madagascar oversells itself with superstar voices and set pieces bloated with noise and undernourished in wit."
"By basic definition a time-travel yarn, but to say that is to make this rather turgid drama sound more interesting than it is."
Malcolm & Marie is the worst kind of self-indulgent nonsense. It is an obnoxious gripe about everything and anything that is so devoid of wit and imagination that it ends up being about nothing at all.
"[Its] approach often feels less like an avenue to understanding than like an artistic dead-end, repetitive and limiting."
The original Matrix was full of dizzying surprises. But it's turned out that the Wachowskis didn't have many more tricks up their sleeves.
"Lacking in any palpable intensity and suspense, it's a challenge to fully invest in this tale, as a film that is rather cold and emotionally withdrawn."
...suffers from a sort of middle child syndrome.
"It's all squeamishly pathetic in a freaked-out way, as the actors are reduced to primates and the movie makes no sense at all."
"It's basically a serial, with multiple, disparate adventures stitched together - perhaps not unexpected, considering that the source material is a comic strip."
"""Addicted"" doesn't fail because it wants to provide steamy, soapy melodrama to a mainstream audience; its faults are a function of its judgment, not of its genre ... more Cinemax than cinematic."
"A superhero in his ability to be in every single location that matters... A teenage boy's savior fantasy: if only I am always in the right place at the right time, I will be the greatest hero my friends and family and my town has ever known!"
For a film that limply purports to lift the lid on the sordid world of Soho sex trafficking this dismal offering is chock full of rank misogyny.
"Perhaps inspired by the success of ""Sideways,"" cowriter/director Randall Miller has taken the exciting true life story...in which the French unwittingly declared two Napa Valley wines superior to their own and turned it into an atonal hodgepodge."
"Robots is most like Polar Express. It may represent a new zenith for computer animation, but the uninspired story drags the film into obsolescence."
"Strauss-Schulson and screenwriters Erin Cardillo, Dana Fox and Katie Silberman want you to think they're ripping the genre open and letting you see the gears but, really, they're content to let those gears do the work for them without adding anything new"
"There are no real bumps in that road, and though the drama has its heartfelt moments, it unrolls as flat as the Texas terrain, cast in an idyllic summer glow."
My eyes are still burning.
"watching it helps you realize that you're not 12 anymore, and you can't be watching movies like this. Unless, of course, you're still 12, so you'll probably be cheering for Amanda Bynes"
"The screenplay emphasizes-beatdown by beatdown-Widner's attempts to flee from the white separatists and the ways in which they retaliate. An inevitable showdown awaits him, but not an insightful psychological breakthrough."
"I just couldn't connect emotionally to anything that was happening, and as marvelous as it all might look and sound, 7 Days in Entebbe in the end proves to be a forgettable terrorism procedural I'd rather not have seen."
"It's an impressively starry cast, but sadly, this lacks the charm, wit and, yes, magic of the original. You'll like it, not a lot."
"Its screenplay is mostly second-rate soap opera and its direction plodding, with many scenes held, awkwardly, longer than they need to be."
"Bailey and Lakin give [Gaffigan] next to nothing to work with, and the result flops where it should crackle."
"Those expecting a familiar voice may be taken aback by [Stillman's] latest, which plays like Todd Solondz had remade Kenneth Branaugh's ""Love's Labour's Lost."""
Its grip is on the mind but not the heart--a problem for a film that clearly aims for some emotional impact.

Netflix&#8217;s charmless new action movie is a veritable tag cloud of keywords adapted into a lump of generic subscriber bait&#46;
"The quality of the acting makes it easy to overlook how increasingly leaden ""Stillwater"" becomes - but not easy enough."
"JFK conspiracy advocates are invited to hold their letters; Parkland isn't really about all that, which is both a strength and a weakness. In contrast to, say, the phantasmagorical JFK, it is impossible to tell where history stops and Parkland begins."
"Kenya is such a joyless creature it requires singular suspension of disbelief to accept that Brian Kelly, the white landscape architect, would stick around."
"For the most part, the characters and situations are stock and cliched."
"Parker has a sensitive approach to the crise d'amour, but his lacklustre leading ladies contribute to an uneven tone."
Muddled sequel redeemed in part by Pleasence.
"Though...an improvement on [Reiner's] recent efforts, it's still too frail and cutesy to be much more than passable."
"For cynics and detractors, it may at time feel like this sequel exists for nothing more than to push the film's most marketable characters front and center."
...the picture segues into a sluggish narrative that grows less and less interesting as time (slowly) progresses...
"...the result is a sometimes amusing, mild mannered philosophical comedy that is, in the end, shallow."
A gang ofelderly morons have sex with garbage. What more can I say about Trash Humpers?
"How a down-to-earth country like Australia grew so attached to the pretentious Somersault, I have no idea."

Never quite locks together into the sweeping cinematic journey Luhrmann clearly set out to create.
"I am Number Four is based on the tween novel by the one-thousand-year-old alien Pittacus Lore. Lore, it turns out, is really James Frey. Yes, that James Frey. Turns out, Oprah owes us yet another apology."
Helen Hunt probably could have made this into a delightful little comedy or a thoughtful drama. But the clumsy mixing of those elements makes for an awkward mess.

"Soon, whenever someone launches into a song, you roll your eyes and hope the tune is a short one."
The acting by Binoche and her two young co-stars is more nuanced than the film deserves.

The film mostly revels in nostalgia and feels numb.
"Were it not for the presence of Carey Mulligan in the starring role, I'd give Promising Young Woman the shortest of shrifts as a festival of terrible acting (apart from her performance) and a stylized but airless polemic on a serious subject."
The anthropomorphized biography of the Mars rover&#44; Opportunity&#44; Good Night Oppy lays on the awe and inspiration too thickly&#44; in an attempt to create a real-life Wall-E story&#46;

"My, my, it's easy to resist this."
"Plenty of noisy cyborg-on-cyborg CG violence with lots of clangy metallic head-butt action is part of the mix. Sound and fury, signifying it's past time to put this franchise out to pasture."
"Not even Jeff Bridges' drawl can salvage a line like, ""soul cycle is the only soul the city has anymore."""
A stiff and stilted historical pageant that somehow manages to make the savage tumult of thousands pitched against thousands seem not so much dreadul as dreadfully dull.
Long on portentous symbolism and short on coherent storytelling.

It feels lightweight and forgettable.

Bogs down in the philosophical shallow end and never quite recovers from what's clearly meant to be a deceptively light tone.

[A] lugubrious exercise in muddled storytelling.
"If you don't connect the stories in a smart way (say, having the same actors play different roles in each story, or tying each narrative together with a single theme) or provide a great 10-15 minute story, what's the point?"
"When featherweight Domhnall Gleeson, as an intense angel of death, is your feminist Irish mob movie's most interesting asset, you need to find Hollywood's witness-protection program immediately."
The mesmerizingly awful The Kid & I is a historic first: a comedy about the making of a vanity production that is itself a vanity production.

"A somewhat pedestrian and heavily sanitized take on an incredibly interesting, unconventional relationship."
Sometimes-edgy biopic of iconic musician doesn't dig deep.
"It's a lot of hooey and might have been at least tolerable if the movie had been rougher, meaner, tighter, and if the filmmakers... had never watched a Terrence Malick movie."
"The cautionary adage about weaving tangled webs in the process of deception certainly applies to Dead Man Down, an overwrought thriller brought to ground by its own contrivances."

Give Winter Solstice some credit for taking an unexpected route.
"The message of manifesting your goals reigns supreme, which is great, but it’s worth mentioning that Watson’s willpower benefits from the privileges of financial security, family support and a curmudgeonly-turned-selfless coach."
The lengthy whys and wherefores&#44; offered up in another behind-the-camera effort from comic actor-turned director and writer Zach Braff&#44; should be seen and likely judged by others who have not watched dozens of similar recovery dramas previously&#46; 
"Some of the pranks are masterfully executed; the beauty pageant and a disastrous funeral near the beginning stand out. But on the whole, ""Bad Grandpa"" can't locate a consistent groove."
"25th Hour has a lot of problems, but chief amongst them is the persistent feeling that Lee is just treading water, by trading on past glories and larding in celebrity appearances in the hope of actually selling a few tickets for a change."

Stiff comedy.
"It's Mr. Holdridge's third film, though, and an experienced filmmaker should offer us more than just brief glimpses of talent."
Most of the gags are groaners.
Austenland needs lessons on how a proper spoof should behave.
A fundamentally conservative look at love that desperately thinks of itself as transgressive.

You can only imagine the carnage that must have taken place in the edit suite.
"Not without its touching moments, A Late Quartet nevertheless can't truly escape the eye-rolling determinism of its script, with only a pragmatic, wry Christopher Walken truly convincing as a man who has lived inextricably bound with his music."
"Because Giamatti is so good and the rest of Duets is so only-OK, it feels lop-sided. Kind of like a duet between Whitney Houston and me."
&#8220;Persuasion&#8221; isn&#8217;t a very good movie&#46; It&#8217;s flat and lacks the spark that it needs to make us care&#46;
"The actors try their best to transcend the flimsy script and unappealing direction, but ultimately the movie offers a mostly hollow experience that delivers a night that you will struggle to remember."
"Unfortunately, Jennifer's Body is a horror movie, and the inevitable girlfright devolves into senseless bloodbath, which doesn't suit the talents of either Cody or Kusama."

It's more a tribute movie than an original.
"Intense yet shallow - with a final, vengeful twist that utterly disconnects."
"This isn’t the worst imitation Bond knock-off you’ll ever see; there are far worse offenders in that category. But Operation Fortune doesn’t do Ritchie, his collaborators, or his cast any favors whatsoever."
"If Shyamalan is going to use his kids as a focus group for future projects, maybe he should start making movies for Nickelodeon already and stop wasting our time."

There are so many unexplored comic possibilities in this movie-within-a-movie that are never explored. That would have required some genuine forethought and detailed script work.
"Seriously, do you have to laugh at rib jokes? Do you really? All right, if that's what you want, don't worry. Hollywood will keep making these movies as long as you continue to support them."
"If you've seen the trailer, you've seen all the good bits. Avoid like a piranha-infested swimming pool."
Every exhausted cliche of the found-footage horror genre is paraded in this depressingly bad film ...

Neither Idris Elba nor Matthew McConaughey can save this flat adaptation from being utterly forgettable.
"By focusing so narrowly on the Lewis brothers' relationship with their mother, the film inadvertently minimizes the scope of their abuse."

"If you enjoy absurdity entwined with predictability, then you may like THE ARTIST'S WIFE. I did not. Even though Bruce Dern gives it his best shot, he is not enough to save this movie."
"While the film is arguably no better or worse than its literary source, it does shatter the fantasies of sexual desire and sexual pleasure constructed within the novel."
"It's impossible to produce anything worthwhile from this screenplay, which has ugly, twisted morals."
"Not so much a movie, but a challenge to your soul. Maybe it is designed to make us wonder if there is a God, and if he will save you from this disaster. He won't."
"Overall, Zucker's cinematic middle finger is about as funny as an exploding toilet seat for hemorrhoid-induced senior citizens...a dreary picture mired in sophomoric sludge."

"This is a transformative performance in a movie that, unfortunately, doesn't come close to matching it."
Snatched feels disappointingly familiar.
"This low-wattage drama struggles with the chemistry of its romantic couple, and with a story that keeps us at too far of an emotional distance."
"Tonally inconsistent, incoherently plotted and almost never funny."
"Once she makes the sound feminist point that it wasn't easy being a girl in 1768, Coppola proves intellectually taxed."
Daddy Day Care is a kid flick that's been kitted out with a lot of grown-up smart-assness&#151;the better to broaden its appeal to audiences who weren't born in the '90s.
"Like the ghouls and ghosties confronted by its characters, Insidious overstays its welcome."
Wasting such talent should be considered criminal. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)
trades for the well-tread territory that Hallmark built its name on.
"Denis' ensemble cast takes its collective endeavour admirably seriously, and there are moments of great visual beauty, but the intensity that the story shoots for is lacking, and the ultimate effect confusing and somewhat empty."
"Starts with a clever premise and raises the prospect of really biting satire, only to trail off into weakly sweet comedy that falls far short of its potential."
There's nothing more off-putting than being treated like a guinea pig.
"There's nothing wrong with trying to be a hard-knuckle action film and a goofy comedy all at once. But here, that effort results in moments of occasionally stunning violence that simply don't mesh with the light-hearted vibe the filmmakers seek elsewhere."
"Ultimately, this is a weird way to honor a man who would posthumously receive the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal and the Purple Heart. In many ways, framing his heroics beside a white wingman undermines the singularity of Brown. "
Anything&#8217;s Possible is a mishmash of elements that do and don&#8217;t work&#44; but it also suggests a strong possibility of Billy Porter evolving as a filmmaker and telling similarly refreshing stories with more emotional bite
"If the glue holding Crash's arcs together was Paul Haggis's belief in the power of racism, this time it's love."
"Very disappointing. If this were a series episode, it wouldn't be in the top-20."
"George Lucas, unwilling to relinquish control over this universe he created, is solely to blame for this celluloid garbage."
This remake of a hugely successful Japanese horror film is very well acted by Naomi Watts. It's just not that scary.
"Despite how hard everybody involved is trying, the laughs just don't come."
"a whodunit that's a ""don't want it."""
"Porumboiu approaches a genre generally designed to generate thrills with maximum dryness, stretching out his inherently absurd premise until it reaches a passive blankness"

Bear ambition
"It had me at hello... and kept me for a long time, and then lost me in its final moments."
"A tired, unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre."
"The film often feels as if it bit off more than it could chew. Still, Vitthal has concocted a definite curio piece considering its cast and valiant attempt to thread topical issues into innovative cultural conversation."
"Jason Statham has become a kind of poor man's James Bond but if you're expecting a coherent plot, forget it. There isn't one. Just action sequences that often lack continuity."
"Unfortunately, the narrative Strouse surrounds [Williams] in feels narrow-minded."
"The screenplay by Lucy Dahl (daughter of Roald) dwells unpleasantly on cruelty and humiliation, and finally Poppy does little more than exchange one form of snobbery for another."
"The film's beauty is undeniable, but it remains a pictorial, surface-level kind of beauty, one that glosses over the muck and sweat of its protagonist's various second-act breakthroughs..."
The warm stars can do only so much to humanize a mucky narrative that unavoidably lessens the film's emotional thrust.
This is the stuff of male fantasy.

"Downey's unbeatable charisma makes these problems less troublesome than they would be otherwise, but wouldn't it be nice if they didn't exist at all?"
Irredeemably knuckleheaded teen-targeted tosh.
"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is...an uninteresting slog, a mishmash of garish CGI, disengaged nonsense and thin narrative...The real evil is whatever corporate edict that led to this thing getting greenlit."
A tedious and unappealing portrait of the obsession of a middle-age architect to write a play.
"Overall, it's just another movie, and it can be dismissed with the same short critique we so often apply to other movies: The book was better."
"By the time [Lee] gets to the lust, it is too late to throw caution to the winds."
"Take the Lead offers few if any surprises to anyone who's seen either the aforementioned Breakin', Beat Street, or, most obvious of all, Dangerous Minds."
"If you thought the first film was funny, you might get a kick out of this. If it was barely watchable to you, you'll want to run screaming from the theater on this one."
"Even though it stars Oscar-winner Halle Berry, there's not much in ""The Call"" to set it apart from the women-in-peril movies that fill cable TV, thanks in large part to an unbelievably wrongheaded ending."
"While not as wildly misguided as 'Elizabethtown,' Crowe's latest effort is arguably just as dissatisfying and it will certainly set the back the trust in his brand for quite some time."
"The first all-out, unmitigated what-were-they-thinking? cinematic disaster of the decade has arrived in theaters in the form of Dolittle."
Nice chemistry between Jennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson is drowned out by dopey scenes and shameless product placement.
"The film is well directed. It is well acted. Mikkelsen is always as compelling as his cheekbones. But it's so muddled in its thinking -- alcohol is good; no, it's bad... but good -- that it ends up with nothing of value to say."
It&#8217;s not &#8220;atonement&#8221; for C&#46;K&#46;s sins or a stark reminder of &#8220;the genius we lost&#8221; when he was canceled&#46; It&#8217;s a serious &#8220;meh&#44;&#8221; squishy and sentimental &#8212; like a Woody Allen &#40;cough cough&#41; rough draft&#44; with lots more swearing&#46;
Rodriguez depicts addicts as a sea of agitated vultures haunting the streets...counteracted by character confrontations forced to move too quickly and predictable plot turns.
"The novelty of having many femmes in a genre that's largely male-driven, and the fact they are played by potentially appealing actresses as Mendes and Johansson, do not compensate for the narrative and technical shortcomings of Miller's solo debut."
The admittedly well-constructed set pieces are all too often diminished in effect by the uninspired camera-work.
The tone is never quite mean enough or never quite nice enough and the film never catches its stride.
"Blackthorn is a handsomely mounted film, with many an awesome vista and rolling plain, but compared to the quicksilver brilliance of its predecessors, it comes off as irredeemably minor."
"What is missing in Colette is the depth of emotion that her writing elicits: It's full of sensory pleasures, promise and longing."
"There's never a break to build character, a pause to appreciate a joke, or cessations in the franticness to allow for explanations."
High Heels and Low Lifes' low-rent aspirations would be far more palatable if not for the film's dedication to painting men as either lowlife thugs or bumbling morons.
"The whole enterprise feels very self-consciously off-trend – an early noughties prologue, with all the relevant accouterments from watch chains to Wonderbras, smacks of a comfort zone the film is tremblingly reluctant to leave behind. "
"The film is about atmosphere and anger, and Greengrass achieves that effect through tight focus on individuals. But the result is imperfect, because it elides crucial elements of the whole story."
"Alan Ball's obsession with the sexuality of teenage girls continues with Towelhead, and you don't have to be a prude to be alarmed by it"
"The filmmakers opted for a more episodic structure (with the occasional flashback) and I do have to say that by the end of the 90 minutes, I was growing weary of the shtick."

"Nothing to see here, keep moving."

"Vomit inducing, treacly nonsense."
"If you like your Farrelly brothers' films outrageous and offensive, you won't be stuck on Stuck on You. You'll only be shocked at how inoffensive the film tries to be."
The story...is limp and preposterous at the same time. The action is lethargic. Jolie's performance is smug...
Does Chris Columbus owe somebody a favor?
So much time is spent justifying the presence of all these cameras that no one bothered to create a single character worth rooting for.
"This is a world we rarely see on film, and Gorris brings it vividly to life. Where she goes wrong, however, is in romanticizing the cock-eyed feminist Utopia that the farm becomes."
This is an intriguing notion and it would have been a better film had it been more fully explored.
"And yet Cooper the writer is clearly not trusted by Cooper the director, who shoots this ripe malarkey with a slow and earnest gaze, like a Hammer horror gone social realist."
"A compendium of self-help clichés, of melodramatic anecdotes about an artist who surely did not deserve such a stale production. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"The humour is slight and the directing often perfunctory, with Madonna failing to get more than ordinary performances from her cast."
"The giveaway comes when one nabob of portraiture -- who is trying to tie Picasso and Braque to an early film about an accordion -- says the influence of the picture was absorbed by the painters ""whether or not they saw this film."" If you say so."

I got a headache watching this meaningless downer.
"How to Deal can't make up its mind what it is, which makes for a confusing experience."
"[It] conforms to [Pixar's] apparent drift toward the average, with toy sales taking priority over originality."
"... the film can't decide whether pursuing validation through social media (by any means necessary) is a good thing; whether Taylor is savvy or soulless; and whether Ingrid is a figure of fun, pity, ingenuity, desperation or horror."
Much of Judy feels a little inert.
"Despite its admirable qualities, Canvas fizzles and falls into cliche."
"Beneath its sophisticated Frenchness and Juliette Binoche-led cast, Elles is gratuitous garbage."

There are probably at least 23 reasons why this thriller doesn't work.
"Effective but hollow, The Bay is a minor work from a director lost at sea."
"Take one modestly funny Bugs Bunny cartoon. Subtract three-fourths of the humor and the witty soundtrack. Add two songs about yodeling and two dozen non sequiturs. Multiply length by 10. Now, if you're smart, subtract yourself from the audience."
"Being the Ricardos is entertaining, well written and well acted, as is virtually all of Sorkin's work. But it suffers mightily from the fact that he forgot to bring the funny."
"The Sacrament may not be a good movie, but it has enough virtues - enough gripping, well-put-together moments - that it made me reconsider my opinion of West as a director."
"At one point, even Fassbender's character remarks, ""What the f*** is going on?"" Finally, some truth in art."
"Hammer does a fine job in his largely solo role, so it's a shame directing duo Fabio Guaglione and Fabio Resinaro choose to saddle him with several hallucinatory/real visitors during his ordeal."
"Triple 9 is all pose, noise, flash and phony grit without a point, let alone a point of view."
What's scarier: ants or Bert I. Gordon movies?

"The Quantum of Solace filmmakers have produced a super-serious, often visually incoherent travelogue of revenge and trumped-up angst."
Let's all come together and hope to God that nothing as degrading as this garbage is released as a theatrical feature or published as a book ever again.
A philosophically dense film that stagnates under its own considerable weight as it dances through 7000 years of world cultures while never quite finding its groove.

The NC-17 rating on John Waters' A Dirty Shame must have a double meaning -- 'not clean enough for those under 17' and 'not clever enough for those over 17.'
"so awkwardly assembled, so self-seriously preachy that it's actually exhausting to watch"
"Over the top, over saturated and overly melodramatic, this wuxia action adventure follows an outlawed swordsman in Ancient China who has to save the Emperor, fight off deadly assassins and restore his dignity."
"As the actress Sylvia Sidney once said about the weepy parts she had, [Jennifer] Connelly should have been paid by the tear."
Stupidity reigns supreme in Steve Carr's Next Friday.
"It's initially good for a giggle, but boredom eventually triumphs."
The gravitas that director Philip Haas and writer Wendell Steavenson would like to bring to bear in this smallish war thriller is simply not an achievable goal.
A scattered comedy-drama with few laughs and even fewer insights.
One of the worst films I've ever seen.
"This movie defies genre not by seamlessly blending, but by jarringly overstuffing - forget scene by scene, you barely know what kind of movie you're watching minute by minute."
"This joyless, witless, plotless and unfathomably worthless endeavour hasn’t a clue what it’s at, and I’m genuinely mortified for everyone involved. Diabolical stuff."
The Time Machine is a loopy love story with good special effects but a storyline that's logically incomprehensible.
"A film full of emotional false notes, bad dialogue and cardboard characters..."
"Despite a promising premise, Timeline proves to be nothing more than an utter waste of your own precious time."
Drone suffers from limited range and a greatly reduced payload.
Maybe they should take a lesson from the movie itself: Stressed out moms deserve better.
"The horror that lies at the heart of the film is fairly obvious, and with no characters for whom we have a rooting interest, A Cure for Wellness is as difficult to swallow as castor oil."
Brainless offering of easily digestible entertainment&#44; with the cast and crew enjoying tropical surroundings while the material drags through uninspired scenes of physical threats and relationship woes&#46;
...mostly dull and ridiculously over-the-top.
What's really sad is to see two Academy Award winning actresses (and one Academy Award winning actor) succumb to appearing in this junk that's TV sitcom material at best.
Rao's ultimate achievements are undercut by the arrangement of her characters into narrative castes that cross paths but can't quite connect.

"Irresolute and underdeveloped, this movie has two ideas smushed together without a disciplined evaluation of what they mean to each other and where they fit. It's a character study that isn't more than skin deep."
Appears headed for a deep-space rendezvous with audience indifference.
&quot;Ticket to Paradise&quot; is a rom-com largely without the com&#46; And the &quot;gag reel&quot; that runs during the closing credits offers some of the biggest laughs&#46;
A pint-size effort.

"There's nothing like a good romantic comedy. Which brings to mind Laws of Attraction, which is nothing like a good romantic comedy."
"The first third or so of Rookie of the Year is hysterically funny, but then the film settles into a sentimental rut, only to pick up again here and there with amusing bits."
"A Marvel movie for those who think they're sick of Marvel movies but aren't really, it's as epically pleased with itself as Ryan Reynolds' lead performance."
The monotonic and glacially paced story eventually comes to its completely predictable and highly manipulative ending.
"In this day and age, things like this shouldn't be allowed to happen."
"Unfortunately, dear grown-ups, no end to the Pokmon invasion seems imminent."

Owen Wilson crashes a marriage.
"... For the most part, the twists and turns... are neither creepy nor fascinating."
"Fast and furious, but also dull and derivative."
"Made primarily for the fans, New Moon is not better than Twilight, and it also suffers from a indulgent, overly long narative and a pretentious, gloomy mood--the main attraction remains Kristen Stewart."
Unsatisfying!
Lila's character is forced to do and say things that are so crude and insensitive that I found myself feeling sorry for Akerman as an actress.
Let's talk turkey. There's nothing to be thankful about when it comes to Against the Ropes ... which passed its sell-by date even before the cameras started rolling.
"""Exit Wounds"" is an action movie left bleeding in a sea of excess, venality and incompetence."
"This modern-day, teen-centric take on W. W. Jacobs' classic horror story The Monkey's Paw is a not-scary dud that suffers from both uninspired scares ad extremely shallow, annoying characters."
"A procession of silly startlements: a sudden loud sound here, a mysterious hand creeping in there. This isn't scary, it's irritating. And then it's tiresome."
Like the whole of the movie&#44; Raiff&apos;s Andrew comes across as far too calculated to seem genuine&#46;
"Of course Machete Kills is supposed to be ""bad,"" but it's also supposed to be entertainingly dumb and loony - which is where it falls short."
"In a pre-election season full of drama, contention and surprise, Man of the Year arrives on the scene with the blistering impact of a spoonful of cold mashed potatoes."

"However stylish and intelligently-crafted as it might be, Quills ultimately proves too blunt an instrument to be either very"
&#91;A&#93; relentlessly bleak film that&#44; while based on a &quot;fictionalized&quot; account of Monroe&apos;s life&#44; may still have you coming away believing that her life was nothing but an endless series of traumas&#46;
Not even the best of actors can give life to a script that has as much imagination as a rock.
"More concerned with Bobby Sands's bed sores than his politics. A movie apparently inspired by Mel Gibson's ""Passion"". The Irish revolutionaries, whatever their flaws, deserved something more like ""The Wind that Shakes the Barley""."
It's clear Bay doesn't give a thought to the story and sees it merely as a clothesline on which to hang his massively ridiculous action sequences.
"It's charmless, shoddily executed and will surely be explained away by Roberts as the kind of film actors do ""for their kids."" If that's so, she should've done a better movie."
"It not only has a star created by a computer, it has a script that could have been created in one as well."
"The sharpness of ""Sex"" is only felt when locked in procedural mode, while emotion and antagonism is applied with a paint roller."
Jessie Buckley radiates more authenticity than the movie in which she's trapped. [Full Review in Spanish]
"The villains are clearly marked, but never with enough nuance or design to make them memorable, while the heroes are flawed but not to the point of challenging archetypes."
"Gangster Squad's violence has a graphic, contemporary feel that's at odds with the vintage crime pics the film wants to celebrate. This isn't the heavy-handed CG-noir of Sin City, but even so, it feels fake."
"[This] adaptation of Ray Bradburry's classic novel doesn't really shock the core like it should, mostly because it's a movie that wants the essence of a narrative without really digging into the themes."
"Buddy action comedy from Mexico is convoluted, violent."
"Harris' dreary, pill-popping suburbia is only a few blocks from Peyton Place."
"By making the film so obvious, in an attempt to violently extract the elementary points of joy out of the story, Final Season stumbles aimlessly instead of storming the emotional receptors like its great baseball cinema brethren."
"Ingmar Bergman's best film, I suppose, though it's still fairly tedious and overloaded with avant-garde cliches."
"Parker wants to be more than a standard action film, and those efforts, ironically, are what sabotaged any chance the film had to be good as a pure action film."
"The messy insouciance wears a little thin, and by the time we get to the absurdity of the extended ending, enough is definitely enough."
"As a feature helmsman, [Beck's] brought us Thirteen Ghosts ... and Ghost Ship, both of which are absolutely atrocious films for any number of reasons."
"Howard's uneven and pedestrian commercial-meets-single-camera-sitcom direction tries to compensate for the extreme staginess of the script, which was adapted by Daniel Pearle from his same-titled play."
"Despite convincing performances, the fatal flaw is the attempt to meld two genres together that don't quite work."
At 90 minutes&#44; it is a long time to spend in a movie full of misery and unseemly actions&#46; It gets its job done&#44; but I&#8217;m unsure if this is the harrowing journey I needed&#46;
"Yet another film where non-trans people learn valuable life lessons, complete with lots of hugs, while the actual trans character's story takes a backseat."
An overwrought and patently offensive anti-abortion drama from the director of the accomplished House of Sand and Fog. Director Vadim Perelman doesn't play fair.
"Other than this gay-friendly gimmick, Bezucha's plot is as hoary as they come."
Poltergeist has some bright spots.
"In this formulaic star vehicle, Schwarzenegger gets to fly like Peter Pan, act like Superman--and fulfill all the fantasies kids may have about their fathers."
"Lee's biggest mistake is in the last half-hour, where he extends an already long film with a series of dialogue scenes, which appear to be variations on improv workshops between the actors."
"A passable actioner with a few memorable scenes, the highlight of which is a fight in a karaoke bar (yes, MASUMI sings). But it's unable to get beyond a level of mediocrity, and MASUMI's performance fails to resonate."
Plays like a private joke for Rehmeier&#44; who&apos;s not pursuing a story here&#44; just an extended run of idiosyncrasy&#46;
Disney tries its hand at adapting a video game and deliver a wasted opportunity of a film.
"When it comes to chimps and space, Stanley Kubrick pretty much covered the topic."
A slick if hyper-predictable comic caper.
"It's not so much a new age, but rather a retread that looks nice and at least attempts to be thoughtful"
"Alas, this time there are about three or four mild laughs in the whole picture, and the entire visual aspect of the movie is a botched disappointment."
"The Ultimate Gift is less a theatrical feature than a Sunday night made-for-TV movie brought to you by Hallmark. That sounds crueler than it is: The movie, directed by Michael O. Sajbel, has plenty of charm."
"I left the cinema feeling pleased, but also kinda hollow. The film lets us bask and reflect rather than involving us in the meat of a story."
"The two principle actors embody their roles well but the problem is not much happens after, wait for it have I said too much, the sinking of the ship."
As Sam Goldwyn said: Include me out.
"While this critic generally likes it when comedies trample on p.c. pieties, Bubble Boy crosses way over the line."
What's most annoying about Notorious is that whatever bad thing that Biggie ever does gets paved over by the end of the film.
"Sappy, forced, artificial and manipulative--but really well ACTED!"
"I've certainly seen worse in this genre. I really do think all concerned were just one or two more rewrites from being a good comedy, and that's a shame. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, Sexual Content, etc. - also Available)"
"The gags are either obvious, lame, ineptly timed or repeated so many times as to render them devoid of humor."
"It's the usual assemblage of grossout horrors provided for your alleged amusement... The freshly upsetting thing here is that this is a Nickelodeon production -- you know, the cable network for kids..."
"The latest example of a creepy new subgenre, the Sundance exploitation film."
"This holiday season leave the emotional manipulation to the professionals (read: your family) and avoid ""Love the Coopers"" at all costs."
This is fire-breathing melodrama masquerading as social commentary.
"Decent at times, but otherwise a jumbled and mostly joyless mess. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sex, Violence, Profanity, etc. - Also Available)"
Interesting only in showing how tin-eared scriptwriting (by Amos Poe) can make 2008 New York City seem less familiar than 1952 Japan.
"Instead of being a subversive action flick about the callous indifference of a growing corporate hegemony, it seems like the product of one."
J&#46;D&#46; Dillard&#8217;s film does a fine job of avoiding the cliches in trying to tell a story of racial progression but feels so concentrated in doing it that it neglects to do the job of generating a real dynamic between its leads&#46;
"Like the wine Bobby opens on his first real date with Vonnie, it just needed some time to breathe."
Too bad Kilmer's [strong] performance is in service to a lurid and repellent account of the 1981 Wonderland murders.
"Rachel Weisz is impressive, but The Deep Blue Sea is never as good as it could have been."
Never manages to reconcile its conflicting tones and ultimately lacks the wit necessary to fuel its outlandish plotting.
"As action movies go, 'Without Remorse' lacks distinction, but Jordan's charisma almost makes it worth watching."
"I have no idea why such strapping young men would be so desperate for sex as to hook up with a couple of museum artifacts they've known all their lives, but this hokey soap views contrivance as a small price to pay for lush mommy fantasy."
"With one genuinely surprising plot twist, it presents itself as a proud provocation and a challenge to both audience expectations and the 'bromance' subgenre; unfortunately, this 'Train' does not come to a stop until it has re-entered the safety zone."
About as exciting as a lunchbox full of carrot sticks.
"More dialogue-heavy and somewhat less frenetic, this sequel is somewhat more to my own taste."
"Russell Gewirtz's script is built around a trick, one that is simultaneously too clever by half and not clever at all (which itself is quite a trick)."
"America's appetite for these yuppie-filled tales has worn down, but not soon enough to stop this collection of self-absorbed twentysomethings."
"Green Lantern opens with the words ""Billions of years ago..."" Take that as a sign of just how much time this ostensible action movie spends explaining itself."
"Though the carnage is wedded to a socio-political message with contemporary overtones, it's still the carnage that dominates, with the message a sauce to make it less unpalatable."
a film as restless as the lost adolescents it depicts
The script is not nearly clever or original enough and Gosnell's direction goes into panic mode each time he stages the chaos.
Rudimentary animation and a less-than-witty screenplay result in a film that plays like a simple installment of the series.
Imagine watching someone else play a video game while another guy narrates it.
"It earns a dubious spot alongside Getting Away with Murder and Lucky Numbers as one of the most unsuccessful, star-driven dark comedies of all time."
...Berg's listless direction brings the film so little point of view that it doesn't much matter who lives or dies.
"In spite of decent performances from the main cast, Carl Franklin's thriller is listless and very weak."
"The Roads Not Taken remains very Potterian; melancholic, middle-class, existential, a touch pretentious, but it does contain a weight that some of her pictures lack."
The cinematic equivalent of a good cop/bad cop work-over.
"Though it's billed as a comedy, Amazing Grace contains very little in the way of laughs - I counted approximately zero."
"It's not a disaster by any means, it's simply just a sequel that could have been better, but couldn't quite find the pitch."
You may find that the movie version of Mamma Mia! brings out your inner Simon Cowell.
The melodrama is unpleasant and the heavy-handed moralizing is entirely unnecessary.
The film's approach is completely subsumed by the importance of the Mayor Pete persona as the means and ends of the candidacy.
"Near the beginning, it's genuinely moving, but somewhere around the middle, the film's sheer excess and occasional silliness gets exhausting."
"The Favourite is full of vibrant colors, opulent sets, lush costumes, blood oranges, tea cakes, and a world of sensory delights. But none of it is beautiful."
"Like the fortunes of Hoffman's doomed protagonist, goes from bad to worse."
One of the most squirm-inducing saccharine-sweet movies to come along in a long time.
"It's fun for a while but once the novelty wears off, you realise The Happytime Murders has a thin, limited storyline."
The film's interest in any of the script's weightier themes only stretches so far before its skin begins to bleed at the seams.
...a fine premise that's utilized to progressively underwhelming effect...
"Despite its highly descriptive dialogue, Cruel Intentions features no nudity ... I doubt teenage boys will be satisfied just to hear Buffy talk dirty."
"It's the sort of film Cusack probably wouldn't have been caught dead in a few years ago, which is a sad, if perhaps a truthful reflection of what happens when people hit their 40s and resign themselves to the way things are."
"Relentlessly mawkish wish-fulfilment fantasy drama that fails to engage on any meaningful level, to the point where you end up feeling sorry for the actors."
"As The Strange Ones drags and drags it certainly becomes more and more strange, but concurrently interest wanes and wanes"
Can we just cut to the chase here? Hayden Christensen has all but killed his career with his performance in Jumper.
"I think I smiled, twice."
"The whole affair curdles into a feeling of unearned, defensive superiority."
"Assayas tells her tale sympathetically, but this sad saga lacks substance. He sells the wretch but not the redemption."
Daniel Radcliffe engages in an otherwise groan-inducing affair.
"... [Alan] Parker lures you into the theater, but then you sit down and all he has waiting for you is a whoopee cushion."
"In the Mood for Love is a lovely, almost handmade object that I find frustratingly coy, almost coquettish."
"The backdrop is snatching at random political significance, and the plot just turns into a stupid and pointless comedy of errors."
"Johnson is a natural action hero, a point presumably made rather cheekily by way of an early cameo from none other than Ahhnold himself."
The problem is the romance is barely developed and the big reveal does not pay off. It makes the entire film very bland and boring
"Henry Jaglom applies what must by now qualify as a tradition of pointless agitation to the disruption of theater. Unsurprisingly, the results are disastrous."
"Not only among the year's worst films, but it marks the rock bottom of Eastwood's output as director."
That's the single biggest problem with resurrecting Borat in 2020: his power to coax out dark secrets of the American psyche for the sake of comedy is compromised when they're no longer secret and no longer funny.
"There may be need for an exorcist, but the power of Christ isn't going to compel the Jewish demon wreaking havoc in this competent but shopworn horror film."
Right down there with the worst of Peter Sellers' Pink Panther quickies.
It's a relentless assault on a man who wished to be left alone.
"rays of sunshine don't make the dark and nightmarish fantasy go away, and it might not be such a fun time for sensitive teens and tots in the theatre"
"As Nelson Mandela, Morgan Freeman functions as a South African version of Charlie Chan, spouting fortune cookie-style wisdom in an appropriately wily manner that disarms the racial agitation of black and white foes alike."
"I admired the movie to a degree, but I couldn't escape the feeling that K-19 should have been more than it is."
"While the pure ambition of telling a story in such bravura, non-linear fashion is surely to be applauded, Cloud Atlas is a model of form over function that never quite comes together or compels the viewer to care."
Most of the film's imagination and energy seem to have gone into the clever casting.
I kept steepling my hands and hiding behind them.
It's hard to ignore the strain of gratuitous cruelty that runs through it.
"As it works out its pattern in an airy carpet of confession and omission, you may find the film adroitly involving. Or, simply, boring."

"Heslov directs for the first time in a career that, I pray, will consist of one movie."
"You figure Bullock would have learned her lesson about sequels after the Speed 2 fiasco. MC2 isn't that bad, but it puts its star's charms to the test."
"The strangely paced drama/comedy never finds much of a groove. Elements of conventional madcap comedy butt against more indie-ready scenes of relationship dysfunction, and the end result is more frustrating than interesting."
"an intriguing thematic exploration that finds its halted, lumbering execution leading to its ultimate downfall."
"I'm not saying an R rating would have necessarily made Little Man a better movie, but at least it would have made it a more honest one."

"Every action scene serves as an oasis, sparsely scattered in the desert of B-movie dullness."
"Smith's performance is shallow, conceited and bland."
"Sleek sets, sadomasochism, a few spankings and an overall blandness"

"Herlihy's screenplay offers few laughs on its own; the film's most humorous moments come from Sandler's low-key, off-hand delivery."
It’s quite possible that I’d like Smoke a little more if Harvey and Bob and their cheering section liked it a little less.
"None of the characters' or the filmmakers' knowledge illuminates, deepens, or complicates this movie in a way that keeps you from thinking longingly of Curtis Hanson's Wonder Boys."
"Middle films in movie franchises run the risk of being devoid of closure and linearity, and it's that inconclusive nature to Robert Schwentke's Insurgent that proves to be its greatest misgiving."
"There's magic here, and elemental spirits, but no magic and nothing elemental, metaphorically speaking. Rote and smaller than its predecessor. Even the songs are bland and forgettable."
War movies used to have dash and color and a certain corny sentimentality; Midway hardly even makes us care.
One of the ten most terrifying movie experiences of my life.
"A by-the-numbers war film, that includes good action, yet lacks character development and depth. [Full review in Spanish]"
"""With age comes exhaustion,"" according to a rueful line late in the film, and it serves as a fitting diagnosis for Woody Allen's latest fallen souffle set in a European cultural capital."
"Combining outer space adventure with late show horror might seem a great way to double your audience, but Lifeforce doesn't do real well in either genre."
"We actually don't see very much killing at all--except, maybe, that of the careers of Morrissey and Stone."
The truth is that De Palma is less a persuasive artist than he is a simple and vulgar bully.
"At its core, it's an exhausting four-hour behemoth that doesn't particularly serve anyone outside of the minority that demanded its existence."
"Antlers  desperately needed more work because, as is, it just feels underdeveloped."
"Too bad Hong Chau's character showed up so late in the film, she could have possibly saved it..."
"Despite Mr. Yen's impressive physical virtuosity, his stoic, often humorless presence tends to neutralize the emotional temperature."
"The longer things last, the less interesting they become as the tone veers wildly between gung-ho action, unintentional humour and shameless jingoism."
Overall&#44; Corsbie effectively captures a world where nothing gets more elegant than dingy bars and grimy little motel rooms&#46;
a below average crime story saved by slightly above average set pieces
Gerard Butler once again demonstrates that his comedic instincts are roughly on par with those of a great white shark.
"Overblown and dull, it's not surprising that this film is largely forgotten."
"Gone are the days of an exciting existentialist movie mastermind who once knew how to stroke the consciousness of the enthusiastically challenged, adventurous moviegoer."
[E]xtremely boring cinema.
"Man, the life of a junkie sure does suck. I got that point fairly early in Acts of Worship, yet for some reason the movie kept telling me over and over again."
"The script and characters would have benefited from more depth and dramatic layers, and some of the scenes look like add-on moments, not part of a cohesive whole."
All one can do is watch Izzy get from point A to point B with as many obstacles being placed in the way as possible.
The leaden story is by-the-numbers stuff.
A lukewarm live-action Loony Tunes cartoon.
Not funny at all.
"It moves like molasses, provides no new insight into the 'tortured genius' psyche and is as boring as watching a chess match."
"About to lose his long-held rights to Ayn Rand's novel, and perhaps to cash in on apparent Tea Party interest and support, producer John Aglialoro ... rushed this film into a low-budget production and it shows in every frame."
It's hard not to be disappointed with a film that possesses so much talent that leads to such a trivial result.
This small scale horror offering can pass the time without any offence intended
"While it has its moments, taken by itself, The Doors amounts to little more than an impressionistic look at a boy and his death wish."
Flat and unsophisticated exposition of one man's mid-life identity crisis.
"The basics of the story remain unchanged, but it's the wanna-be-blockbuster additions that rankle, be it the incoherent direction of first-time feature director Carl Rinsch or the copious CGI beasties who look like rejected Lord of the Rings villains."
"There's schmaltz a-plenty and the odd, rare laugh but even the normally dependable Wood lacks enthusiasm."
The film favors the scientific over the spectacular (visually speaking).
...a lackluster comic-book movie that thinks terrorist is a synonym for revolutionary.
Year One is a slapdash film in desperate need of more authoritative stewardship.
"Lines like ""Get your bark on,"" ""Who let the dogs out?"" and ""Cowabarka"" abound. Many of the jokes revolve around excretory functions."
"For a film that suggests even in its title that it reflects a necessary and under-discussed conversation, it falters quite tremendously."
The result is a movie that plays like a noble but misfired adaptation of the young adult novel it never was.
"...neither McKay nor Sirota knew how to thread the needle. Don't Look Up is a failure, hopefully, one that all involved can improve from."
It's just horrible stuff.
Horror-movie protagonists should know better than to make wishes on mysterious ancient artifacts.
No one beyond the smallest of children should be entertained by this shameless money grab that fails in virtually every way.
Is it wrong to root for the volcano?
"Zusak's story is stirring, and it holds the film up during most of its predictable parts, but The Book Thief never rises too far above that. The narration from Death only serves to make it more like some sort of fantastical fairy tale."
"Stillwater runs long but doesn't run particularly deep -- or at least, not quite deep enough."
Imagine someone telling you the joke about the chicken crossing the road repeatedly for 98 minutes. You have now imagined this film.
Taking Woodstock fails to immerse us in the visceral feeling of being there.
...has a cast that's too good for the script-manipulated characters they play.
"I'm all for hybrid media, mooshing together images and ideas to come up with something that looks new, or at least respectful of its multiple sources. The Musketeer is not that."
"The action sequences are generally well-executed, but they're too much of a muchness. CGI makes them seem too facile and not tactile enough."
"Imagine Hostel with a CSI twist and done for the Oxygen network crowd, and you'll have an idea of what Untraceable is like."
"I've never seen (a remake) do anything as stomach-turning as the way Adam Sandler's new movie rapes, pillages and incinerates Frank Capra's classic..."
"Are you, more or less, setting yourself up for disappointment if you go to see a film adaptation of one of the most powerfully written novels you can recall reading?"
"This is not a bad crime drama, it's an awful one."
"Even at 107 minutes, it outstays its welcome...and it's difficult to see Machete Kills cutting much ice with an audience that doesn't consist of damp-palmed teenage boys."
"... dialogues, speeches, and ideas repeat to the point of making the progression of the film a burden. This is the type of film where no one in the cast really stands out."
"Nothing more than toddler fodder. It's so sweet, the Addams clan would burn it in a bonfire."
"Under different circumstances, A New Age might have been enough to entertain the kids during a long day of Christmas shopping. As a cinematic experience in pandemic times, it feels like a product from a completely different age."
"Maggie Grace can be snobby-scared, or snobby-haughty, or even snobby-injured, but she can't seem to leave that snobbyness behind, no matter what is chasing her."
"A Western with contemporary, comic ambience, lacks sufficient funny parts."
Every predictable layer found within the derivative bandages of The Mummy reveals the sarcophagi of a dull and crusty film. The performances are stale other than Tom Cruise who is excited about @#$! no one else can bother with.
the best segments are from the most obscure directors... the big guns mostly strike out
A pretentious drama.
Isn't exactly a great date movie unless you like to argue afterward.
At once a mystery so intricate that the multiple climaxes generate snickers and a slasher picture too subdued to satisfy the thirst of that genre's audience for blood.
"The animal characters that roam the park are, sadly, uninspired, and there's only a small hint of magic created throughout."
Nothing here amuses or delights or rings true.
"It's great to see these four working together, good sports and consummate pros that they are, but the fact remains that they're shoveling crap, and it's insulting."
[A] fantastically stupid thriller ...
A TV movie-grade romantic farce that's practically medieval in its cornball conventionality.
"""Mortdecai"" is mortdifying, a mortdal sin of a movie that's headed for the cinematic mortduary."
"Wish Upon is a singularly strange movie, teetering between intentional camp and pure clumsiness."
A problem here is that almost all the characters are victims.
"If Oscar had a category called Best Bad Film You Thought Was Going To Be Really Awful But Wasn't, Guys would probably be duking it out with The Queen of the Damned for the honor."
"If I could go back in time, I wouldn't see this pic."
"With scenes careening into each other oblivious of momentum, tone or plot structure, it feels like a Frankenstein of a film."
Once made ... Afterschool proceeds to regurgitate its thesis with all the grace of a lumberjack leveling a redwood.
"No one involved has any idea what to do with Brosnan, burying his playful performance in a film that's almost impressively soulless."

"It's one of those smoke bomb comedies that seems to disappear even while you're watching, leaving no trace of itself behind."
"The Sicilian is unambiguously atrocious, but in that very special, howlingly grandiose manner that only a filmmaker with visions of epic greatness working on a large scale with a multinational cast can achieve."
"There's whimsy aplenty in all this, and one or two touching moments, but on the whole it's a misbegotten affair which strains for authenticity like a hooley in a temperance hall, while never quite finding it."
The film would've been better served if the maudlin human struggles and teenybopper romance had been cut and replaced with a bunch of Shiba Inu puppies rolling around the hotel lobby.
"Shares its main character's instability until it falls apart completely, failing to mix broad attempts at humor with startling violence."
The film is a disaster all around.
"It pays homage to classic filmmaking, it's got two fine-looking international stars, and it calls attention to the environmental crisis in the rainforest. It's still a dumb movie."
"If you prefer something a little more coherent, this movie can't help you."
"It's true ""Dominion"" is a better prequel than ""The Beginning"", but in the end, that's not really saying much in either case."
"I was mostly on board with Whiskey Tango Foxtrot until its third act, when it completely derails. Kim, confronted with a serious personal crisis, does something that's frankly unbelievable and baffling."
The film neglects its characters and many of them lack purpose. [full review in Spanish]
Theres just not enough material here to sustain a 90-minute movie.
"However you cut it, with all that talent, Charlie Countryman feels like a sad, wasted opportunity."
indicative of the sausage factory that is Hollywood because it reeks of overdevelopment that delivers a movie that seems to make less sense than its possible original intentions
"Benefits from the presence of Denzel Washington, but not much else."

"Nothing-script, performances, comedy, drama-works in the slightest."
"The movie sends mixed messages. It's hard, but gooey, too. Trick 'r Treat showed that Dougherty has a mean streak (with wit), but with Krampus, he's clearly been charged with delivering a wide-appeal PG-13 film."
The movie comes across as a collection of competing themes and ideas that collide more often than complement one another and never fully gel.
'The Accountant' doesn't quite add up.
"There's a fine line between fragile sensitivity and wimpishness, and Ben Whishaw tramples all over it. He is the drippiest British actor since the Merchant Ivory heyday of James Wilby."
"Like Mother, Like Daughter ultimately fails in its stereotyped construction of its characters and in resolving its conflicts in an obvious and boring manner. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Statham is overshadowed by Aubrey Plaza and Hugh Grant in this too-average actioner&#46; It would be nice to see him stretch a bit&#44; or even face a worthy opponent some time&#46; 
"There's a problem with the kinds of bloated action sequences that form the skeleton, muscle, and flesh of something like Hobbs & Shaw - a lack of excitement."
A Sunday night-ish affair whose larky tone grows tiring fast.
"Most of the time, movies based on video games seem just like movies based on video games: A sprinkling of story is added, there's a lot of jumping around, and the show is forgotten quickly even though the video game itself persists."
Maybe making a fairy tale with modern ideologies wasn't as smooth as fitting into a glass slipper after all?
"Uneven at best... But say what you will about Hill's sicko, squirmy humor, at least it's distinctive."
"As they walk through the desert, I was hoping a pack of wild, rabid camels would attack them and eat them to get this movie over with."
"A hybrid of Mad Love and Save the Last Dance, Crazy/Beautiful boasts strong performances underutilized by a banal storyline that manipulates familiar characters into following a well-trodden, predictable path from point A to point B."
Image trumps performance.
"A couple of visual gags are still on target and the acting is swell, but on the whole the story is too simple, too flat, and too uninteresting to stand the test of time."
It's frustrating how close this is to being a good movie. The pieces are there. The follow through isn't.
It's Hollywood at its best in deflecting the audience with gloss so they don't notice the thriller's emptiness.
If you&apos;re looking for a tense and terrifying experience&#44; you better go see &#8220;Barbarian&#8221;&#46; But if you don&apos;t mind a film that&apos;s not interested in realism&#44; and instead develops a silly yet fun story&#44; &quot;Orphan&#58; First Kill&quot; works&#46; Full review in Spanish&#46;

"Incoherent and inconsistent, this is a step back for Statham in his quest to become more than a cult figure."
"I'm sure Melissa McCarthy loves her husband Ben Falcone very much, but the bottom line is she has to stop making movies with him."
"Apart from Considine, the actors all deliver superficial performances beneath several layers of slathered-on Summer Of Love drag, and Woolley's use of multiple film stocks and flash-cut editing jumbles together a bunch of '60s filmmaking clichés without"
"I expect more from a theatrical release, more than just information presented in an orderly fashion."
"Packed with abysmal dialogue, ham-fisted acting and laughable dramatic sequences straight out of the daytime soaps."
"where Snyder failed was in using too much to do too little, even though he had the right balance between the two in his grasp the whole time."
"A slow, queasy adaptation of Ian McEwan's brisk, queasy novel of the same title."
This retro-futuristic 'lust in space' melodrama is a 'Saturday Night Live' sketch that goes on far too long.
"Hysteria attempts -- and resoundingly fails -- to present itself as a light-hearted, empowering crowd-pleaser. Instead, all we come away with is the knowledge that Hugh Grant doesn't want to do this type of film anymore (but Dancy does)."
Much of the movie...is an advertisement for male emotional immaturity.
"I'm sorry, but that's entertainment?"
Woo is not able to make the action scenes believable or enjoyable.
"The characters never engage our interest, and the relentless violence grows monotonous."
The plot is rigged to disintegrate if a moviegoer's IQ nudges above 70.
"Passionless and uninspired, a derivative non-Coens noir throwback with barely the inklings of racial critique is not anything effective or enjoyable."
This film creates two things: a challenge of substance and the equivalent of a violent bedtime story.
"There is a good movie to be made about someone like Brandon, especially with someone like Fassbender, a performer of exceptional technical facility and a fascinating sense of reserve. McQueen's isn't quite it."
"The result entertains, mildly so, but the film isn't as intelligent as should be or thinks it is.  "
No need to book a night at this hotel.
"This is routine Roth as usual. Homophobia, attempted nihilism, vapid writing, paper thin plot, and nonsensical all the way..."
...succumbs to an overly and relentlessly talky vibe that prevents the viewer from connecting to the film's story or characters.
... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
"Saw V attempts to make the audience feel smart for sticking along for so long, only when it's all said and done you'll feel like a fool for sitting through this disappointment."
"As it is, HM:A47 is doomed to be forgotten."

Luc Besson demonstrates [with Anna] that he has lost the ability to innovate and to surprise viewers. [Full Review in Spanish]
"The whole feels like a short story bloated out of control, a desire to create something beautiful in its intensity damaging the coherency and potency of what's portrayed."
Several of the film&#8217;s components work really well while others drag the film down or hinder the storytelling&#46; Perhaps the biggest problem is that the movie tries to cram in too much story and too many characters&#46;
"I see and hear Onward without disgust, but there is nothing that I am passionate about it. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"In terms of a female-centered comedy, Rough Night gives it a good shot but just falls a little short. It has a great cast, but a lackluster script."
"The Summit picked up an editing prize at Sundance, which you can only surmise was awarded because the film does a fine job of leaving you as confused as the people on K2."
Too many back and forth time lines; too many moments of inaction; too little background on major characters - equals a movie that's average even to die hard Jason Statham fans.
"The smell of horse droppings is powerful, but we don't have to go around sniffing for it. Power is not importance. The Deer Hunter is powerful; it is not important. It is too melodramatic, self-indulgent and shrill to be important."
"Maybe McKay has been spending too much time on Twitter. With Vice, he's fallen prey to that platform's preference for smug dunks over insight, persuasion or comedy."
"I'm a great admirer of the work and efforts of everyone involved in this film. I just don't think this is their finest moment-or 138 overly drawn out moments, to be exact."
The Dream Master has a sort of constant level of goofy idiocy.
"The movie rambles, sputters and repeats itself for 108 minutes before staggering to an unsatisfying conclusion."
"""CBGB"" ain't no party, it ain't no disco, it ain't no foolin' around."
"Oyelowo and Mara try to bring humanity and tension to the testimonial thriller of two lost souls finding their way together, but they only succeed in bursts, hampered by marketing copy masquerading as dialogue."
Guaranteed to irritate most viewers&#44; offering little reward after a reasonably tense introduction&#46;&#10;
"Stone's trademark techniques -- fast cuts, multiple images, mixed film stocks, odd film speeds, weird angles -- overtake the film."
"Dan Gilroy's tonally bold directorial debut can't quite pull together its differing ambitions, resulting in a story that's not entirely satisfying as a dark character study, amoral thriller or curt commentary on the sensationalism of local TV news."
The movie deteriorates into melodrama.
"...the result is clunky and predictable, not streamlined and exciting like the Spielberg films of old."
The very existence of Larry the Cable Guy would seem like a pretty good argument against the concept of Intelligent Design.

You don't have to be an industry expert to see that the biggest problem with Knight and Day is that the filmmakers quit working before they'd turned a good premise into a good movie.
"After a while, Never Again gets so busy celebrating ageless virility that it forgets to tell a decent story."
Why?
The film's wooziness wouldn't be disastrous if it swept audiences up in the zest of pop creation.
"With little cohesion and no respect for the editing process, Old School often feels like someone threw film clips on the floor and strung them together willy-nilly."

"It's not quite the end of civilization as we know it, but it's not a good sign."
All the performances are top notch but Trintignant and Harduin keep things interesting in a story that feels unfocused.
"A gonzo, garish mash-up of ""Clockwork Orange/Blade Runner"" and ""Streets of Fire."" A mess, but you've never seen anything like it."
"Swords, sorcerers, archery and mysticism rule in this big, silly popcorn adventure."
[T]he battle between the movie's educational and story-time modes is arduous.
"The film is a sloppy, discombobulated mess that mistakes loud skate punk music for character development and prosaic special effects for a narrative."
"It hasn't jumped the shark, exactly, but it does send its singing Bellas jumping off an exploding yacht. Because that's what a cappella competitions are about!"
"In short, this is a Queen biopic for people who like their music biz stories tame, easily digestible and, in the sexuality spectrum, at least 75 percent straight."
There are so many terrific mob-related movies and TV shows out there that you shouldn't waste your time on this sort of subpar effort.
[An] underachieving indie.
At least the movie-within-a-movie angle and the creative liberties taken with details in Gale's book are somewhat clever.
"The script isn't particularly impressive and with so many films exploring similar material, the film seems predictable and redundant."
"Pauses proliferate in “After Yang,” enriching the air of rumination, and the line readings tend to accentuate the negative."
An unbelievable mix of sports movie clichés and girl-power attitude
The only high point here is Jake Gyllenhaals dedicated performance that almost salvages this unwarranted Americanization of a far superior Danish thriller.
"Kick-Ass was a clever sneer at ""grim and gritty"" superhero movies; Kick-Ass 2 really isn't much of anything."
"Beyond entertaining fans with variations on the life-or-death challenges that seemed so startlingly fresh a mere four years ago, Saw V's primary purpose seems to be setting up a new series of films featuring Hoffman as the evil puppet-master. Wheth"
"The Whale sometimes feels more like an intrusion than a movie, invaded privacy wearing the mask of drama."
"Surprisingly harsh when it comes to the dented appeal of its lead character, the movie is a predictable drag, attempting to cozy up to its young adult literary origins in a decidedly tuneless fashion."
The flimsy plot -- less a whodunit than an isn't-it-screamingly-obvious-that-that-guy-done-it! -- will have thriller fans singing the blues.
Unwatchable!
"Based on a play by Amy Fox, Heights is beautifully shot on location in New York and consistently well-acted, but it sticks a little too closely to the surface to be very compelling."
A flatulent comedy.
"Berg and Wahlberg continue their movie bromance with the fourth and, perhaps, least appealing pairing of the producer/director with his certified producer/star."
"It's a bit too muddy, dismal-looking and smoky to beguile us, too fixated on filth and too dreary-looking to really shock us."
"An ambitious animated film that at least attempts to aim for something different, but is impaired by its hackneyed plot."
It's as impactful as it is insipid. And that's the worst thing that can happen to a biopic. [Full review in Spanish]
"Further proof that Hollywood has become an equal-opportunity employer where the gross-out comedy genre is concerned, but as the f-bombs rain down it's hard not to feel Fey and Poehler deserve a far sharper and smarter vehicle for their talents than this."
"""Pan"" over-invests in special effects. This is painfully felt in the movie's endless, noisy and emotionally inert climax, where the characters and story get lost in the digital razzle-dazzle."
",,,a movie showing a bunch of aging comics, who once represented 'cutting edge' youth, showing that their shtick has gotten old, and so have they."
Man of Steel (has) a cold heart that no amount of spectacle can compensate for.
"It swells the running time with lengthy hang-out scenes with he and Brad, joins him at the barber shop (twice!) and delves into a bizarre and misjudged block of character assassination against William Shatner."
The desire to fast-forward becomes almost overpowering.
"Director/co-scenarist Hugh Wilson does acceptable work here, yet the concept's myriad possibilities for satirical and fairy-tale riffing go untapped."
"It's vile stuff, and ""Killing Ground"" would much more compelling if there was a scene contained within it that wasn't featured in dozens of similar endeavors."
"Billy Crystal could turn ""Othello"" into an insipid, feel-good movie."
"There's a loose charm to this comedy that disarms the audience, raising smiles instead of laughter as three nutty characters swirl around each other."
"Because the majority of scenes are drawn out and obviously improvised, this disjointed and rambling confection will have limited appeal to others."
"Ultimately, though, the latest documentary overreaches to make Houston's life and death about something bigger, in a way that at times feels as strained as some of the notes during that aforementioned comeback."
The film's determination to remain politically even-handed robs much of the drama of any sense of urgency or purpose.
"An unreleased movie is like a kind of commodity, one whose value goes up and down depending on the vagaries of circumstance."
We are facing a 'tour de force' at a scant pace of career suicide. [Full Review in Spanish]

Feels like a stagy adaptation of an already contrived play.
"There's not much to it, but you do sense, after watching it, that this filmmaker might someday make something very good, once she starts looking beyond her own immediate vicinity."
"It's not that great a picture, but it does what it's supposed to do and that's why you spend the bucks after all isn't it?"
A solid if unspectacular debut that attempts to play with horror conventions to mixed results.
Tedious tale of middle-aged angst.
"""Kidnap"" probably could've played into its feverish, violent, trashy side more aggressively. As is, something seems to be holding it back from its own monstrously exploitative premise ..."
"Let's call it four out of six numbers, with no power bonus. Some payoff, but don't quit your job."
The director is more interested in seeing how many outrageously dazzling tricks he can pull off with his camera than he is in constructing a coherent or plausible storyline.
"Passable slasher fare, but it needs an influx of humor, innovation and money to be a real “game” changer."
"It’s a cute experiment, and I’m sure they had fun, but the final product leaves a lot to be desired."
"By trying to be both grossly outlandish and sweetly endearing, the movie is alternately crass and mawkish."
"It's bigger, noisier, shinier, and dumber, and it has no earthly reason to exist."
The movie is both sloppy in its details and too literal in its thinking. A less blunt allegory might have made for sharper entertainment.
"007 goes Star Wars in this, the silliest of all Bond's adventures."
The world is an amazing spectacle&#44; but the writing feels 20 years old&#46;

So bad it's hilarious.
Disney-Bruckheimer digital pulp with no instincts for derring-do or beefcake inspection.
As for the director&apos;s participation in the stories of these pictures&#44; it&apos;s sometimes too minimal&#44; often too much of a distraction&#44; and generally approached without a clear method&#46;&#46;&#46;
"It's as if the fun was all in writing the first act, and then filmmakers couldn't stick the landing."
This is like watching a car-crash in slow motion.
A B-level thriller with giant plot holes and lazy direction that pretends it's a real movie by casting A-list stars and getting a foreign art-house director to helm it.
"It becomes increasingly difficult for Leisure Seeker to manage its varying tones, and ultimately impossible."
[A] well-meaning but ultimately blah fictionalization.
"Beckett gets what it can from its Greek settings, but can't distinguish itself as either a straight-ahead thriller or a political drama."
It’s best viewed as a glint of first-act promise (and a glimpse of what Herbulot could make with a few more million dollars and a VFX assist).
Extraordinarily poor.
"The plot presents a set of circumstances that rely on dangerous tropes to further its narrative, and making it impossible for me to suspend disbelief."
"It was very, very difficult to get behind Mathieu Roy and Harold Crooks' doom-and-gloom-fueled Surviving Progress"
"In the pile-up of melodramatics that clutters his movie, it's hard to tell for sure what Jones is trying to say."
"If you ever needed something in the dictionary to illustrate ""First World Problems,"" it would be a still from this movie. It's about rich, vulgar twits who run around saying stupid things nobody would ever really utter."
"Failing even to attempt genuinely humorous gags or scenarios, and incapable of conveying the thrill of its obsessive pastime or the majesty of the animals themselves, this feel-good male weepie remains comedically and dramatically grounded."
"Nothing says summer like a fun and stupid action movie with beautiful people and even more beautiful explosions. Patrick Hughes' comedic actioner is not that movie, though it wants to be."
"Awfully bawdy, never sexy, rarely funny, actually boring, one-note sex comedy."
This is the first Fontaine movie I've seen that qualifies as lightweight.
William Shatner's inauspicious feature directing debut is a double letdown.

Angels & Demons struggles to maintain momentum as Langdon hurtles around Rome.

A perfectly mediocre horror film.
"A cheap, bad-looking, one-joke movie (Millennials and their social media amirite nyuk nyuk nyuk) filled with enough tired and uninsightful self-referential jokes to fill Scream 5 through 7."
"Has all the hallmarks of an ambitious, stuffed-to-the-gills ""big idea"" reboot that spooked the studio and got chopped down to a 95 minute bare-bones September dump."
"Oppressive overkill can suck the life from any hallowed institution. Even, dare say it, the X-Men."
"This intro to a new big-screen detective never quite gels, despite Fassbender's best efforts. Too unremarkable to leave you anything but cold."
"Doesn't add a lot to the Watergate movie canon or to the understanding of Watergate in general, nor does it have much of a read on Felt the man"
...a fairly tedious and thoroughly familiar portrait of drug abuse.
Plot not deep enough.
"Collateral Beauty should be seen by no one, not even ironically, as its device-laden attempt to draw out tears remains calculating, absurdly structured, and borderline offensive."
Claiming the production is on autopilot would be shameless given the setting&#44; but it&#8217;s also very accurate&#46;
The labored Madame fails to rise to the level of sophisticated social satire to which it aspires.
"...comfortable enough, but there are no fireworks."
"This is a Nolan film, so nothing is simple -- or quick to the point. At nearly three hours, the film piles on the twists, wonky physics, heartfelt speeches and pseudoscience."
While Angel offers up a few potentially memorable set pieces...they all fall victim to having too much repetitive editing and not enough kinetic energy...
Tonally it shifts from mild comedy to the shock of seeing an internee getting his head blown off and the conceit is about as convincing as The Sullivans taking on a Panzer Division.
300 Spartans with pecs on a wall...

"It's carried off with a kind of winking detachment, an almost incredulous inability to lend any sort of gravity to its melodrama or its violence."
Soderbergh's movie likely will appeal more to filmmakers than filmgoers.
"In Fabric weaves a bizarre, atmospheric horror tale of a killer dress in a commentary on consumer capitalism that has far more style than substance."
"Instant Family is an unfunny, cynical, annoying and incredibly misjudged family comedy that not even the talented cast and good intentions can save."
"Noirishly atmospheric, Red Lights proceeds with caution for much of its length, rarely getting up to cruising speed."
"It's clearly a stab at recreating grittier, more emotionally fraught origin story moments that Deadpool 1 certainly didn't shy away from, but this time it feels like the movie is trying to punch way, way above its weight class."
"If the filmmakers weren't trying so hard to deny the characters' failings, Brokeback Mountain might have lived up to its immense reputation."
Maybe Adam Sandler really has some familial connections with the Devil.
It's pretty clear that all those terrific ideas could use a little discipline and maturity before they ever amount to a truly great movie.
The film's metaphorical language summons another sort of monstrosity that it never entirely unpacks.
"According to this film, New York is a joyless place where people live only to drop names, attend parties, cheat on loved ones and brood."
Even with lowered expectations it's far from great. What a shame.
A goose-bumps-free horror show.
It feels strangely trivial.

"Any love these characters may or may not actually share is so innocuous, and so downright false, that it sadly becomes invisible."
An overlong misfire that has only flashes of staggering power.
"Most of the time, you won't be chuckling, so much as contemplating the emptiness that lies in the brains of all too many production executives."
"Kathleen Quinlan, once Tom Hanks' wife in Apollo 13, her forehead now retaining Botox like the Hoover Dam retains the mighty Colorado."
"A doubly tired remake: first of the infinitely better 1997 film from Japan, and second of virtually any cliche you can imagine from situation comedies."
"Go see ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,"" but only so they make a third one where an Edward Zwick-less Tom Cruise battles a surprise villain played by film director Rob Zombie."
"Has all the raw and refined talent in the world, magical sets, transcontinental charm, a diamond in the rough when it comes to source material, and a love story to boot, and yet, it falls short."
"Mickey Rourke recently made headlines for dubbing Passion Play ""a terrible movie,"" a proclamation that's ultimately most notable for its understatement."
It's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey.
Ultimately more of a clever conceit than a full-fledged narrative.
"The most telling moment comes right at the end; the interview snippets with cast and crew that play over the credits are more interesting than everything that's come before combined, emphasizing the confused intentions at play here."
"One day aliens will land on Earth offering us answers to the secrets of the Universe. But, because of films like The Hottie & the Nottie they will deem us unworthy and return to the Heavens once more in their carbon-free interstellar cruisers."
"This puerile so-called comedy is a complete waste of the talents of Anna Faris, a cheeky beauty who is obviously channelling Marilyn Monroe - God forbid a remake of Some Like it Hot is in the works."
"Borrowing from this bottomless well, perhaps it's best to say that you should hang up, turn off your phone or even cancel your service should this film attempt to reach out and touch you."
"Though not as fresh or funny as the 2003 original, this sequel is occasionally playful, but seldom inventive or witty."
"Better than pretty much everything else associated with Tyler Perry, but that's still not saying much. A talented cast is wasted."

"It's hard to know where to start with the film's clangers, and a lack of familiarity with Ireland does seem to blame."
One of the most shameless films of the year.
"Though well acted, this Kiwi-shot Western would've done better to invest more time with its leads, and ditch deadpan attempts at a subplot of pursuers that has no reasonable payoff."
"The thinly disguised contempt with which the Coens view redneck culture grows tiresome and, eventually, a bit mean."
Why Arthur is such a curmudgeon remains a mystery.
The Haunting in Connecticut is exactly as good as it needs to be to satisfy people who like haunted-house movies or ghost stories.
Who the deuce decided to filter Sherlock Holmes through Batman & Robin?
"There are good jokes here, interspersed with strong action sequences, but both sit side-by-side, rather than in integrated fashion."
"It is a tragicomedy that seeks to show the other side of the war, but that ends up drawing on a blank criticism improved only by the good work of its actors. [Full Review in Spanish]"

"The film is like enjoying a beautifully tender filet mignon where every bite is delicious. But, at the end you find a disgusting fungus-filled toe nail on the plate."
An impressive performance cannot save this movie from being blubber. [Full review in Spanish].
A thin premise.
"Here is a curveball for a comedy home-run. But at its best, Horrible Bosses is a blooper."
"In fairness, the movie is more or less competent for being what it is. Of course, I could say the same of most brick walls -- but I'd hardly recommend that you pay eight bucks to sit in front of one for two hours."
The whole thing feels like a product of desperation and creative exhaustion.
"The film feels careless and calculated at once: careless in its assembly, calculated in an attempt to copy Castle. (But who could blame Hurwitz and Schlossberg? They have no other film credits.)"
"While [Cooper Koch] the best part of Swallowed (and that's not saying much), it'll be interesting to see where he goes from here. "
"What is going on here? Father and daughter bonding? It's all very vague. And creepy, since Murray and Jones act more like a couple than she does with Wayans."
"Sadly, the music is largely wasted on the material, as somehow gnomes racing a lawnmower doesn't organically translate to a song about fighting and getting a little action in."
Even an engaging performance by John Cusack can't save this fluff film from being so tiresome.
"""Stillwater"" is a good example of a bad movie despite its sincerity and the powerful gifts of the people behind it."

The brothers swamp the fragile story and characters with such a deluge of CGI tricks and elaborate action sequences that it proves hard to care about the humans on screen.
"Chris Rock is a pretty funny guy. And ""Heaven Can Wait"" is a pretty funny little movie. So can someone explain why, in combining the two, Down to Earth isn't nearly as funny as either one."
Based on a true story but nevertheless feels false.
"After Woody Allen had made one too many 'serious' films, his devoted fans longed for him to go back to being funny again. Things now have come full circle, for after Scoop, they're going to wish the Woodman would stick to serious drama from now on."
"The movie doesn't make a whole lot of sense and, when it does, it would be better off not doing so."
"There are moments in the movie that are so melodramatic and cliché-ridden that they're downright cringeworthy. [It] will definitely be a crowd-pleaser for the film's intended audience. For everyone else, proceed with caution or avoid the movie altogether."
"Suffers from the same handicaps as its title character: it's a little too stiff, a little too timid, and it feels like it's trying a little too hard."
This teen satire set in a Christian high school is an admirable attempt to acknowledge the powerful influence of religion in contemporary American youth culture.
Seyfried engenders sympathy and a rooting interest that carries us through a film whose supernatural aspects almost feel like an afterthought and which carries its subplots a bridge too far.
"Contains all the elements of a fun, snappy, pre-summer jaunt, and yet the film is actively in competition with itself. The tone is grim and honest when it wants to be, but not necessarily when it needs to be."
"Perfect for that good Christian family who's aching to see a neutered, unoriginal crime thriller that clumsily coughs up its 'spiritual' theme only in the last line."
For all the explosions and violence and near-death escapes by our antihero&#44; the film feels too detached from reality to make a deeper impact&#46; There&#8217;s too much black and white&#44; and not enough gray&#46;
"Nine Muses is clearly the work of a talented filmmaker, and there are many moments to beguile the ears as well as the eyes. Yet it's a long slog through a few thousand years of myth and history, and most viewers are likely to grow impatient."
The film is plainly a meaningful project for the openly gay Emmerich and Baitz. Stonewall carries tremendous symbolic weight for millions the world over. So why this white-bread generica?
"What's mostly missing from ""The Gambler"" is a sense of why Jim is so insistent on squandering his money, privilege and patrimony."
Too clumsy in key moments ... to make a big splash.
"Don't be fooled by the indie trappings: despite its downtown vibe, ""Lola Versus"" is as clichd as any Hollywood rom-com."
"If ""Like a Boss"" had a decent screenplay, and was competently directed, it might have been pretty good."
It has all the pieces for a riveting ordeal but lacks the focus to elevate its status to something more gripping&#46;
"The characters are completely uninvolving, the narrative incomprehensible for the most part, and the performances seem to reflect the bewilderment of the plot."
Laughably melodramatic and agonizingly inert.
This is not a horrible movie&#44; at times it can even be gripping&#44; but not as good as it should have been&#46;
The story is burdened by a thousand clich&eacute;s ...
"Google, the corporate entity, is so lovingly portrayed that the film itself resembles nothing so much as a massive product tie-in."
"Pro forma stuff, so much so that you start to wonder why no fetching femme resistance fighter materializes to help the Americans on the ground."
The film not only amplifies all of the flaws of the original but even screws up the things that it actually got right the first time around.
"Branagh tries to pair his pint-sized protagonist's moments of joy with the harsh realities of living in a society coming apart. But in its carefully choreographed nostalgia, it is all too twinkly eyed to make much of an impact."
"Necromongers? Underverse? I don't know about you, but when I hear names like that, I start tuning out and thinking about different kinds of pie."
A disappointingly anemic tale of forbidden love that should satiate the pre-converted but will bewilder and underwhelm viewers who haven't devoured Stephenie Meyer's bestselling juvie chick-lit franchise.
The joke is now beginning to wear thin. Most of Brüno's interactions with his unwitting stooges are pretty lame and you wonder how many hours of filming he had to go through to get even this paltry footage.
"The movie's intelligence cannot be faulted, but its energy level can be. There is a certain sad, tired, low-key undertow to the film that prevents it from really delivering its emotional content."
"As generic as the title, this historical drama spares no cliche in depicting Mexico's Cristero War of the late 1920."
Voyeurism channeled through a character so bereft of decency and filled with such a false sense of superiority only serves to leave the viewer feeling a little dirty.
&#46;&#46;&#46;a perfectly competent endeavor that never quite rises above the level of barely-passable mediocrity&#46;
"""Men in Black II"" never matched the first film's perfect blend of action, comedy, and sci-fi elements."
"There's no ""Dilemma"" here at all - just a simple disappointment."
[There's] iffy moral posturing in a story that criticizes a man for spying on a teenager in the shower as the camera moves in for far more intrusive close-ups ... this unpleasant titillation lingers longer than Brosnan's otherwise entertaining heroics.
Rampart is nothing more than an showy cinematographic exercise that depicts an anti-hero who resolutely won't change. Does the film undergo any kind of story arc? Nope. Give me a Training Day any day.
"At this point, looking to juice the series with action scenes is the equivalent of applying a defibrillator to a cadaver."
Mungiu's moralism is like that in Death of a Salesman: It rationalizes and sentimentalizes common corruption.
"While Celeste And Jesse marks Jones as ready to make the leap from TV to film, it also shows that she maybe shouldn't be her own screenwriter."
"My Policeman stays on the surface, uninterested to scratch it... [Full review in Spanish]"
Its shortcomings in presenting character and human situation seem the more disappointing in view of its conspicuous success in conveying both the excitements and something of the mystique of flying.
"Escape Room is best when you're only thinking about the next clue to be solved, not the machinations of plot."
"A bland and formulaic tale of two senior citizens who discover that it's never too late to fall in love - which may well be true, but doesn't keep this rickety recycling of a 2005 Spanish-Argentinean comedy from feeling long past its sell-by date."
"Structurally and emotionally, Never Let Me Go is a mess, a sci-fi love triangle that left me completely cold."
Stiller attempts to turn bikini-size material into a maxi-length coat. All that does is create a product full of holes.
Legislation needs to be passed guaranteeing that any movie in which Dane Cook appears will find his character smacked in the face with a shovel and dumped into an open grave.
It's a breathtaking but somewhat empty waltz through vampirism.
"[B]road, crude, unsubtle remake of the brilliant 2007 British film... [T]he tone is wrong, the pacing is wrong, and the emphasis is in all the wrong places..."
"It's a failure, less because the odd stylistic mix doesn't take (it does from time to time, and to striking effect) than because Landis hasn't bothered to put his story into any kind of satisfying shape."
"Grim melodrama, about the horrors of debt and living beyond your means."
Sadly just about every element of the film ends up dragging it down&#44; including a screenplay in search of a more compelling plot&#44; a multitude of bland characters&#44; cheap-looking special effects&#44; and a very subdued lead performance from Jared Leto&#46;
"It's only funny in fits and spurts, and the story takes a ludicrous, unbelievable turn toward the end."
"The thing is so clumsily scored and staged, so filled with banal self-help homilies, so predictable and ordinary and flat, that what should have been a quick glide around the floor becomes a slog."
Quantumania throws every can of paint in the garage at the screen while struggling with tone and convincing character dynamics&#46; Jonathan Majors is an absolute beast as Kang the Conqueror&#46; The MCU&apos;s Phase Five starts on uneven footing&#46;  
A tepid and stilted Chinese soap opera about two sisters and their uneasy relationship.
Forgettable talking-animal adventure has some scares.
"The direction is so workmanlike, so dispassionately competent, that it seems De Bont may be as resigned to his career's downward plummet as those of us who admired his debut film, the thrilling Speed, are puzzled by it."
Lowbrow humor.
"Even if you still find the premise funny, how long can you laugh at this same sorry routine?"
Narrative Deja Vu Haunts Oblivion.
"How much longer must we subscribe, as moviegoers, to the sentimental brotherhood of violence?"
"The movie bearing her name settles for a bullet-pointed, sub-Wikipedia approach to Billie Holiday, a fascinating, complex and contradictory soul who was so far ahead of her time it truly boggles the mind."
"In the press notes for the film, Sobel shares that his initial response when he was offered the film was a no, not seeing the point in revisiting something so recent. He should have trusted his first instinct."
"The movie's producers could use a genie of their own. Surely, if granted three wishes, they could have produced a better film."
"""Why bother?"" Sandler and his collaborators seem to be asking over the course of a very long two hours. And streaming viewers will hopefully respond in kind."
One of those movies that's more worried about showing off the use of a new technology than actually telling a good story. [Full review in Spanish]
"It just feels so routine, and director Nick Cassavetes' pacing is so sluggish the film feels longer than it is."
"In the end, the great fault of ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" is that the filmmakers didn't trust what they had. They didn't trust how much audiences enjoy Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger."
"Triple Frontier is a movie unsure of what it wants to do or say, and as such does nothing and says nothing."
"Weisz makes Hester's dilemma interesting for a while, but even an actress as fine as she can't begin to mold the character into someone worth caring about."
"Nanny McPhee isn't a bad film, just a disappointing one."
Murphy's quietly precise performance ultimately can't overcome the film's chilly gravity and unsatisfying finale.
"Taken individually or collectively, the stories never add up to as much as they promise."
"The movie is a mild compeller for history buffs, and occasionally it's better than that. But the teenage mall rats, on whom box office success largely depends, are more likely to zoom away in Alamo rental cars."
"Its screenplay serves as auto-critique, and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure."
There's not a genuine moment to be found in this film.
There's too much caution and not enough lust.
"The movie is only 84 minutes long, including credit cookies, but that is quite long enough."
Lacks both the good acting and a screenplay.
"Not only is it an assault on the senses, the film is so narcissistically nihilistic the only ones sure to get a kick out of it are members of the Manson Family fan club."
"To the Wonder might be more experimental, but it's still all Malick, a filmmaker who can't see the forest for the craftsmanship."
"An intrepid crusader against actually fake news, he's very much a hero for our divided moment - you just wish his own biopic stopped fussing and stepped out of his way."
An ultimately overwrought project!
Never quite succeeds as anything more than Dangerous Minds Redux.
I's a bit like a trip to the gym on a flat tire.
A film whose only function can be to pander to establishment fears about the rock culture and to reenforce their misconceptions about the underground movement as a whole.
&#8220;Double Tap&#8221; doesn&#8217;t have much new to offer aside from a handful of side characters&#46; The story is pretty bare-bones while the humor misses its mark as much as sticks its landing&#46;
"I demand a bit more from... kids films. You have the potential to engage the most open imaginations in the world, and you waste it by dragging out a few mildly cute gags instead of hitting some solid material."
"Director Mike Flanagan tried to mix suspense with a hreatfelt story, but got lost in the way by adding too many subplots and looked for horror in the already kown roads of the genre. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Considering the talent involved, it's shocking how much of a bore ""Men in Black: International"" is."
The film's stoic stare at personal crisis provides little opportunity for audiences to embrace either characters or subject matter.
"It definitely out-Ryans ol' Saving Private, but the goal is questionable; there comes a point when most viewers will avert their eyes (and hence stop being viewers) just for a respite."
"I hope you like it; if you get a chance, drop me a line and tell me what I missed."
"There are a few highlights worth a look and an accomplished supporting cast to ease the oddity along, yet The Details doesn't add up to much despite its rather elaborate design of misery."
"I personally didn't care when anyone died, I was bored for most of the way, wasn't impressed by its few action scenes."
The movie's just an excuse for the entire cast to point guns at each other before engaging in verbal or actual smackery.
"...this is easily Perry's best film, which is to say it's serviceably mediocre rather than godawful."
"In all it's an unconvincing portrait, and as the Dylan clone says, ""Empty, like one of those cans of soup..."""
"Viva Rock Vegas is nothing more than eye candy, and not a very tasty piece at that."
"""Our Kind of Traitor"" does many things well but the feeling afterwards is, unfortunately, one of disappointment."
"On Taylor Swift, not since Madonna in 'Who's That Girl?' have I seen such an annoying performance. The only thing that could've saved her jittery acting is if Kanye West had stormed her scenes. That might've resulted in an Oscar nod for Miss Taylor!"
"The Spy Next Door is bland, unassuming stuff for the kiddies. But few family films have Jackie Chan at their disposal."
[Jupiter Ascending] blends astonishing special effects work with plotting that would barely pass muster in a bad Saturday morning episode of Flash Gordon or Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.
Don't expect magic here.
"All in all, It's a Wonderful Afterlife is essentially a bundle of missed opportunities."
"Offers a look at the underground rave scene, providing an accurate picture of what one night must be like, but without giving any insight beyond the superficial."
A series of hit-and-miss gags and embarrassing situations that should be a lot more suspenseful.
The real twist would have been if we had been able to watch and appreciate how Marlo had to actually earn her ever-after the old-fashioned way.
Generates all the heat of a snow cone.
"Alternating between hammy melodrama and rabble-rousing scenes of graphic violence, it's dishonest entertainment for adult-age children."
"Get Rich seems stagy and phony. What a missed opportunity, because the rapper's compelling story offers ample opportunity for drama."
"Nowadays, Moore has a lot of competition. The best time to see this film is before the news cycle changes, which could be any minute now."
One of those 21st-century sequels that cares more about inserting Easter eggs for the original film than it does providing similar entertainment value.
2012 is straight ahead smash the world to smithereens while a cadre of characters placed in soap opera situations deliver unintentionally laughable lines.
"It’s all very clever but only clever, and it swipes ideas from other, better Cage movies..."
"Once an idea is introduced, it's tossed aside, unexplored; though there's plenty of talk, this isn't exactly a sci-fi ""My Dinner With Andre."" Tense music substitutes for genuine tension."
There is much to grate on your nerves in this TV Afterschool Special trying to pass as a real movie.
"The production has a lot going for it... But the narrative is cluttered with court intrigue against a background of repetitive battles, and the storytelling structure is exhausting."
"A waste of time, talent and resources on a movie that would feel more at home in the direct-to-DVD aisle of your local big box store than on a multiplex marquee."
"The remarkably dismal quality is emblematic of the mind-set that brought the movie, and its attendant crises, into being."
"It's too technically proficient to be dismissed as garbage, but it's too serious to be enjoyed as camp. It occupies the perfect sweet spot of terribleness."
I've seen most of the World War I aviator movies and Flyboys crash lands in the flyweight division.
Earnest&#44; emotional&#44; good-hearted and edgeless&#46;
"If a person spends enough time looking serious, sounding defiant and staring intently at computer screens, all will be well with the world."
The King's Daughter is a would-be pop confection that would have been stale even if it hadn't sat on shelves for nearly a decade.
"Burdened with uneven acting and portentous dialogue, the film has one important saving grace. Franz Lustig's cinematography exquisitely captures the grandeur and loneliness of the American West."
"""Something New"" is a tentative baby step toward a hopefully improving cinematic dialogue about the fact of interracial relations and their acceptance in our society."
"The film is flat, with an openly religious look and insists at all costs to leave an edifying and unquestionable message in an era in which the lack of questioning is a major evil that afflicts society. [Full Review in Spanish]"
An embarrassingly bad comedy.
The contemporary setting works against the kind of tale that was even a bit silly in the pre-heart-transplant era.
Those coming in cold may be forgiven for thinking they've wandered into Atonement remade as a farce.
A mesmerizing misfire&#46;
"An overwrought, underwritten hootchy-kootchy tuner that desperately wants to be Cabaret, but lacks the edge and historical context to pull it off."
"Jack Black (playing the uncle) and Cate Blanchett (as his best friend and partner in magic) are usually welcome screen presences, but they seem embarrassed and undirected here, and the less said about the child actors, the better."
"The slapstick is often clunky, but Robinson has a sweet jester's disposition that keeps many of the gags from collapsing."
"While the picture has the star power of Nicolas Cage and Julia Roberts voicing insects in love, they're not nearly as interesting a couple as Woody Allen and Sharon Stone in Antz."
"There are cycles of inspiration and rebirth, but the barbed promise of the early going loses its way in choices aimed at sentimentality rather than, as Harvey Kurtzman memorably put it, humor in a jugular vein."
It makes for a nice Mother's Day card. But not enough for a complete movie.
"Always dressed and coiffed like perfect dolls, the Bratz reaffirm sisterhood by heading for the mall."
The film's less-than-engrossing atmosphere is compounded by Wysocki's competent yet charmless performance...
"The movie might best be enjoyed by kids, although parents won't appreciate the 'comic' moment when the deceased Roy reports that the coyote that ate his carcass 'made love' to his skull."
"This year's one-zillionth mean-girl movie, and that's not the only thing here that's played out."
"There is no great romance, no epic special effects, just a lot of terrible dialogue spoken by wooden actors in a film so CGI dependent; I felt like I was watching a video game."
A very strange mix of family sitcom and R-rated bro-down buddy comedy&#46; A witless string of dumb comic set pieces and an unfunny slog&#46;
"You could call this slow walk down memory lane a Very Special Edition of Antiques Roadshow, but that makes Nostalgia sound far more fun than it really is."
"Expect this ghost of bad movies past to walk quickly to the back bins of Blockbuster, where it should be filed under a helpful heading, monotonous and juvenile."
"Film genius to miss the mark. Case in point: Terrence Malick's To the Wonder, a beautifully empty exercise that - so glacial is the pace - makes Malick's Tree of Life look like G.I. Joe: Retaliation."
"Whereas Peckinpah managed not only to raise hackles but to get under the skin, Lurie manages only the former, which reduces the material to the level of sensation-mongering."
"I feel it empty, artificial and somewhat predictable. [Full review in Spanish]"
Had there not been a Battlefield Earth I'd say this was the biggest turkey of the summer.
What's not there is the ability to stitch together the light tone of screwball comedy with the uncomfortable business of real biography.
"Certainly tries hard, it's maybe not quite as good as I hoped or expected of what might have been a perfectly fine vehicle for Glazer."
"Admirers of the first two films will feel pangs of nostalgia and a residual warmth for its charismatic leads, but as an extension to the series it feels forced and unnecessary."
"A film is that seems to be cooking a good psychological thriller, but unfortunately this never happens. [Full review in Spanish]"
"It's supposed to be a romance, but plays like a long, boring business meeting in which the naughtiest bits are raised not in the bedroom, but the boardroom, where contract negotiation stagger on over the proposed merger of his manacles to her wrists."
"Catch and Release is a puzzle missing a few critical pieces, and as a result, it never really connects."
"Neither as extreme nor, for that matter, as interesting as its troublesome title."
"As I was sitting in the auditorium alone watching this film, I kept looking around hoping there was a chandelier above me getting ready to plummet to the ground."
A humor-free comedy
"The only time the movie comes to life (so to speak) is during its climax, when Victor succeeds in bringing his creation to life and must deal with the subsequent rampage... After slogging through 100 minutes of tedium to get there, it's hard to care."
"After a while, this disappointing film just lays there, like a wrestler body-slammed one time too many."
These conversations are about as deadly dull as any dialogue I've ever heard even in the earliest talkies.
"Veering between alarmism and cautious reassurance - between technohysteria and shrugging, nothing-new-under-the-sun resignation - ""Men, Women & Children"" succumbs to the confusion it tries to illuminate."
An underwater drama that just about drowns in its own sea of heroism.
"Though individually attractive, together Gere and Ryder are as unappetizing a combo as pimento and peach."
An unexciting script leaves a sour taste.
"Yes, there are moments of great beauty here, but boy, the story could have used some editing."
"Animation usually gives room to play with colors, shapes and sizes. This film doesn't offer anything special. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Lumet tries getting back to the outrageous satirical mode of Network and Just Tell Me What You Want, but this family dysfunction story fails the classic requirements of social critique."
"Lost in Space may ultimately be an insult to your intelligence, but it is an insult with good special effects. But with a big-screen TV, you can wait for that HBO premiere instead of shelling out cash for this loser."
"It's a good-looking movie, filmed in a polished high-gloss, high-tech style, with lots of energy and color. But Thief is ultimately undermined by a nearly incomprehensible romantic subplot."
"The value of Closed Curtain is the very ineloquence of its cri de coeur. Where its predecessor defiantly showed that Panahi could take it, here the stresses show: they're tearing him apart, and it shouldn't happen to any artist."
This would be passable enough fare for a throwaway comedy had the two stars bothered to bring their A-game.
"This ugly, gross, spittle-spattered and incoherent junk movie just isnt funny"
"For a werewolf movie, this is an awfully toothless, turgid effort."
"Friends: The Reunion has a few amusing moments but it's aimed at adoring fans who want a sentimental, unthinking journey."
Confounded my high expectations by being much too depressing for my taste.
"Understanding the importance of strong, principled journalists should be a cause for celebration. Yet here, the media is depicted as a force, hell-bent on destruction."
"Delpy and Rock click so well together that we'd much rather hang out at home with them, instead of racing around the city with sitcommish supporting characters."
It would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun.
Director Brian Robbins keeps going for easy laughs.
Evinces enough hatred of mankind to make Todd Solondz look like a dedicated humanist.
It&apos;s a sequel that bores me in perpetuity with its abundance of one-dimensional female characters and&#44; most of all&#44; bland action that exposes the anthropological side of Marvel without any sense of wonder&#46; &#91;Full review in Spanish&#93;
"The BFG is a decent movie that has some stellar moments, but is overall pretty forgettable, and that's a downright shame."
"Strict plausibility isn't necessary in these movies, but you can't just throw it out the window, and ""No Escape"" shows why."
"Travis Bickle's trouble was that he couldn't get close to anyone, but Robert De Niro's trouble is that he can't get past the audio-visual pandemonium to show you Bickle's torment from inside."
It feels as though Leconte is as sick as we are that he's doing another Leconte movie.
...goes on so long it starts to feel like the fifth piece of chocolate cake when two or three would have been more enjoyable.
"If not for its major aesthetic gimmick, Loving Vincent would resemble yet another revisionist take on a historical figure where fidgety jumps in time and point-of-view help deconstruct the Great Man Theory a la Citizen Kane."
"Two-plus hours of Gallic affectation, one of those French films that tries to be crisp and tantalizing but proves more a soggy cinematic souffle."
&#8220;Puss In Boots&#58; The Last Wish&#8221; is a huge disappointment&#46; The lure of a franchise is that it&#8217;s easier to market a known commodity&#46; That works for donuts and hamburgers&#44; not so much for creative storytelling&#46;
"If a film is set in another country, it should feature people from that particular country as more than just bad guys or extras milling around in the background."
“Doctor Strange 2” extends no mercy to those who merely seek escapist superhero entertainment. Study up or risk suffering complete disorientation.
...the scant details about the occult and the supernatural and shifting narrative focus detracts from an otherwise stylish effort.
Shyamalan fuses the fictional evidence of his extraterrestrials with the presumed righteousness of God in a way that will make no sense to anyone who has ever questioned either.
"It's a film from which you'd expect the moon, the stars and the sun. What with an actor like Crowe and a director like Scott. Disappointingly, the talented duo gives you the most wishy-washy film of the year."
The sense of déjà vu I had watching so many runaway vehicles crashing and smashing through the narrow cobblestone Spanish streets only reminded me how much more fun I've had watching the running of the bulls in Pamplona.
Ocean's 8 does a good job of exploiting the strengths of women and shows the audience the beauty of a glamorous robbery that goes perfectly right. But its ultimate lack of interesting characters makes it lifeless and forgettable as soon as it's over.
"Not very good, but not the utter embarrassment some seem to have expected."
[Amelia Earhart] must have been a fascinating woman - but you wouldn't know it watching the slick but unsatisfying Amelia.
"Unfortunately, for as much dialogue as ""Digging for Fire"" has, the film doesn't go into much depth about Tim and Lee's true feelings about marriage and their lives."
"It's hard to imagine any sort of alchemy transforming the script's parade of Star Wars references and tired nostalgic '90s signifiers into gold, or -- this many years after Jar Jar Binks -- make their passion seem anything but sadly misplaced."
What transpires is an okay ghost story...
"Insidious: The Last Key fulfills my wish of learning more about Elise, but it is still probably the weakest installment of the franchise."
"Pour le ""meilleur"" et pour le pire, le cinéaste allemand nous livre au bout de ces deux heures et demie de tapage et d'exubérance son oeuvre la plus aboutie à ce jour."
"The talent involved and the potential of the story can't save Midnight in the Switchgrass from poor editing and directing choices, and an embarrassing script."
"Yelling ""Look at all the dumb-dumbs"" cannot be the basis for successful satire."
"The movie succeeds on some level, but the series has definitely begun to eat its own with Hannibal Rising."
"To put it in teenspeak, ""My Boyfriend's Back,"" a saga of a decaying zombie lad, rots."
"Escape from Tomorrow often makes good on its aspiration to stick it to the man in the mouse suit, but let's not get carried away: Miley Cyrus is currently doing just that to much greater effect."
The Night forgets how to scare the audience entirely with each passing moment.
"This is a strange story to tell and an even stranger way of telling it, and worst of all, it's puts us in position to root for the redemption of a character who doesn't deserve it and shouldn't have it."
Film in the Time of Oprah is more like it.
"Parents will be thoroughly bored, and kids will enjoy the flatulent camels and not much else."
Hammett exudes an atmosphere of leaden make-believe.
"The Musketeer is, at times, a watchable flick. It's got the action. Lots of it. Furious swordplay. Galloping horses. Cannon fire. Too bad its 'all for one' is all for naught."
"All About Steve may be a harmless escapade, but sitting through it proves to be a painful experience."
A welcome alternative to the teased-at-ComicCon kid's stuff. Which isn't to say that Inferno is good.
I'd be pleased to see a vibrantly romantic picture defy the Zeitgeist and restore one of Hollywood's central genres. This just isn't the movie to do it.
Every odorous frame before and after [the 'outfit'] can be safely consigned to the litter box.
"The film too often tumbles from whimsy into full-bore pretentiousness, while one sickeningly violent scene in particular seems designed purely to shock, not because it moves the story along."
"Unfortunately, this is one of those movies with a twist ending that turns a character inside out, revealing earlier scenes to be essentially fraudulent and more or less invalidating one's emotional investment in the story."
"Typically, while a good screenplay only requires a single author, this unimaginative, derivative dreck required at least four, even with the massive cribbing from 2001: A Space Odyssey."
"A tragic true story underpins director Peeter Rebane's earnest queer melodrama, but hoary symbolism and hokey scripting work against its authenticity."
"The movie is bad and dull, and then bad and dull and gratuitously violent, not even finding a trace of guilty fun in its narrative dumpster diving."
A messy and unsophisticated cop drama that quickly stumbles into a spiritless slumber.
"Regardless of how long you last in 1408, the logic to which you are entitled never comes."
Desperately seeking Mamet.
"Spencer seems to have fun with a rare villainous role, and there's a certain amusement in seeing her outwit the kids. But any such pleasures are short-lived."
"The story is tired, the comedy forced and the mother's larger-than-life quirks are an acquired taste."
"The problem lies with Hart himself. He's a bit of a cypher, highbrow yet bland; the film never gives us a reason to care about him or the mess he gets himself into."
"Now comes the inevitable movie, which, in the hands of writer/director Tate Taylor, does a novel about injustice an injustice itself: It turns lite into featherweight."
"Overall ""The Gardener"" is flat and lacking in soul, a word that comes up many times in the movie."
"Nothing that even dimly approximates real life is anywhere to be seen, unless your idea of real life is a half-hearted Sex and the City remake set in an enormous, open-air branch of Anthropologie."
One of the ugliest movies I've ever seen.
This is a pristine example of incoherent storyline mixed with poor editing and limp writing.
A waste of nine bucks and 88 minutes of my life.
"Because 'Brokeback Mountain' has made such a profound impact on so many viewers, I almost feel guilty that I can't rave about it."
The arrogance and ignorance on display is truly amazing. Arrogance of its superiority over the audience's intellect and ignorance of filmmaking craft.
This third attempt to bring the notorious Midway video game to the big screen is Aussie Rules R-rated.
The technical workmanship would feel impressive were Wright's vision not so threadbare.
"it's all a muddle of a script that seems to have been constructed from the cinematic equivalent of baling wire and chewing gum. The cut-rate, generic chewing gum. The kind that doesn't really hold its snap."
Boo.
"Sem se decidir se quer ser um drama sobre a difcil vida dos caminhoneiros ou um frgil e artificial filme de tribunal, este trabalho de Walsh desperdia Raft, Bogie e Sheridan, alm de contar com uma atuao pavorosamente ruim de Lupino."
"Less nutritious than the fried baloney sandwich that is still revered by the ostensibly more sophisticated J.D. and just as difficult to swallow, Hillbilly Elegy is a load of condescending crap."
"Though well-intentioned, it's not terribly compelling."
"It's hard to tell how much time has passed between scenes, or just why, as the twists come, the characters would suddenly turn so dumb."
Disturbing thriller about webcam porn has graphic violence.
"""Child 44"" plays like a curious relic of an earlier Cold War mindset, when Western audiences took comfort that they were living on the right side of the Iron Curtain, and relied on movies to remind them as much."
"Ultimately, the film tries so hard to strike a balance that it ends up standing stock-still."
"What's ultimately missing from Slevin is not only mystery and humor, but any trace of inventiveness to counteract the overriding triteness of its Pulp Fiction-ish shenanigans."
Approaches something important and refuses to be interesting.
"The doc often veers from the relationship to focus on Cohen's career. It often feels unnecessary. At the same time, the film fails to make inroads on the central mystery."

"This is a very strange movie in its moments, even if the execution is dull as anything. "
"Convenient story leaps, shamefully inappropriate elements, completely incoherent action, and frustratingly lowest-common denominator ""comic"" relief."
"A hybrid, containing both fictional and real elements. As often happens with such efforts, the movie doesn't fully succeed in meeting the demands of either side of a complex equation."
"To put it bluntly, if Scroogely, Disney's 3-D animated version of A Christmas Carol is a calamity."
The pressing question is which sense can be utilised next in the Hollywood horror factory. Touch? Where everyone has to go round wrapped in teflon or as human-sized condoms?

"Despite the movie's sympathy for the high stakes of Henry's adolescence, the myopia of his point of view settles over ""Chemical Hearts"" like a layer of grime."
Analogous to an overly long episode of Punk'd in which the moviegoing audience is the punkee.
A jumbled mess.

"Like fingernails dragged across a blackboard, or Charlie Day's voice -- one, long screech."
unbearably bad
"Considering its title, the film needs more supporting character development to flesh out its central domestic drama."
"Neither worthy of my laughter nor capable of inducing sleep. No, this is one of those rare films where its badness turns the cogs of your brain."
"Sadly, it's yet another disingenuous, botched adaptation that wants to make money off of the fan base, while conveying obvious embarrassment toward the property."
"As it stands now it is merely a movie that desperately wants to say something important and profound, but the best it can come up with is ""Boo!"""
It's one of those pictures where all the characters are idiots and the plot would be resolved in five minutes if any of them had half a brain.
"Elegant -- and, yes, suspenseful -- but ultimately lazy."
"Star Trek Beyond trivializes social issues like militarism and race by downplaying moral seriousness, and replacing it with ""action"" and genre familiarity. It's cinema as comfort food."
"""All the King's Men"" is a grand scale embarrassment."
"The fun seems gone, and the now-requisite end credits musical number seems like a relic from 2001."
"The action is fun, the plot has a lot of twists and turns, but in reality this installment is only marginally better than the fourth film."
"A not-so-thrilling heist thriller that drones along mechanically between explosions and car crashes with Ewan McGregor, who is making entirely too many movies these days, none of them worth writing home about."
"Whether intentional or not, Mateo left a bitter aftertaste -- and Matthew Stoneman's story becomes one so much more grating than intriguing."
The film is so insistently formulaic there is hardly a moment when you don't know exactly what's going to happen.
"Given how rough-and-tumble Jeff's prior existence seems, will leave a skeptical audience wondering how long this happy ending can possibly last."
Die-hard fans of Witherspoon and the romantic comedy genre will probably find enough to like in this film to make it worth a trip to the theater. Everyone else would be best served by spending their hard-earned money on something else.
"Despite all their warrior-woman posturing, and all the lip service to their respective strengths, the two women ultimately wear their crowns like handcuffs. Neither can outmatch the scheming men who use and abuse them."
Every attempt to develop the plot disappears amid the visual spectacle. [full review in Spanish]
Deeply adequate.
The best thing that can come from this film is that it will be so poorly received both by critics and audiences that it will put a damper on Hollywood's current interest in remaking anime.
"It's really the bluffer's guide to Klein, useful for those looking for an introduction to the concepts but not much else."
"Shamefully sadistic, achingly dull and totally predictable, it rehashes the far superior 1984 original."
Not a single bit lands in The Happytime Murders.
long on blood and thunder and relatively short on emotional engagement
"This playful endeavour is undoubtedly an entertaining one, but is too stony-faced in parts, which is to the film's detriment."
It is a film that works with such premeditated efficiency that it ends up becoming a fiction that shows the mechanization with which it was made.
"There are questions that would have been major issues in a better film, but here they're just quibbles among scary-enough set pieces."
Kidman gives her most personality-free performance as a psychiatrist whose estranged husband (Jeremy Northam) starts behaving suspiciously by becoming a better father to his son (Jackson Bond). How spooky is that? The answer is: not even slightly.
It's Paul Walker escaping with his costume from Castle Cameos Pictures at the Las Vegas Excalibur.
"I can't imagine anyone taking anything positive away from Juwanna Mann, other than the conviction that it's not a very good movie."
The link between comedy and tragedy is closer than Ferrell believes but the line isn't as clever as it should be and not nearly as profound as it believes it is.
Your whimsy tolerance will be tested.
"Evans can't compete with more or less obvious influences like Oldboy and Infernal Affairs, but he's certainly no slouch in the sadism department, making his films in some ways exhilarating but also wearying, for better and worse."
"Not without its heated confrontations, but it feels unnecessary, working to depict the downfall of a man who's beaten them to the punch in terms of addressing his own self-destructive tendencies."
"Allen's Ultimate Schlemiel, no matter what he's being called, Danny Rose, Alvy Singer, or Sid Waterman, is always the same pint-size, uncoordinated, misanthropic, befuddled Jewish intellectual."
Cage is the only one here aware that he is making a B-movie comedy. Everyone else plays it straight. (Parental Movie Review also available)
A hodgepodge of dull characters played by even duller actors with occasionally interesting photography and an irritating score.
"I had a hard time buying so much concentrated bile, and for me, the film loses an objectivity that might have otherwise scored points for the destructive nature of competition that can wreck a decent man's corrupted psyche."
"[Dark] marks yet another career low for star Will Smith, who has arguably appeared in the worst movie of the year in four of the last five years."
"Digressive rather than progressive, The Last Jedi fails to develop the new, exciting and complex characters we met in The Force Awakens."
"Long on pandas but distinctly short of magic, humour and, notably, the sort of visual spectacle we've come to expect."
"Extract is so bad its rottenness becomes a source of fascination, which is a good thing, because there's nothing else to sustain your interest while the 89 minute dud drags by."
The kind of comedy whose best bits have already surfaced in the coming attractions trailer.
"The interesting ideas the script presents are left by the wayside in favor of watching one woman's self-destruction. With Gyllenhaal at the center, it's always captivating, but by the end, the experience feels more voyeuristic than illuminating."
"Once more, Wong raises questions of fate and predestination and, while throwing in a tasteless reference to 9/11, fails to address them. It's an orgy of cheerful carnage with no context or purpose and, worst of all, no suspense."
"The movie is about the crashing, chasing, shooting and exploding, not about the human collateral damage left in its wake."
A creatively bankrupt comedy about a cosmetics tycoon that wastes its top-level talent.
"Breaking and Entering just hangs there, positing its theme of how the personal becomes political and the political becomes personal over and over, without ever grabbing either your heart or your mind."
You need to make an argument. A parade of like-minded nuclear-power advocates who assure us that everything will be all right just doesn't cut it.
There's about as much action as My Dinner With Andre.
An emotionally uninvolving flick that attempts to play on the heart strings of the viewer and fails in its effort.
A mess.
"The film moves at a dizzying pace, as it moves either backward or forward with no rhyme or reason."
Live by Night is a dense and disorganized movie adaptation in which Ben Affleck covers too much ground for any one story or character to succeed.
"Cruel, ugly and mean-spirited in equal measure, and absolutely none of the excitement that one might reasonably expect from a Tom Clancy adaptation, Without Remorse is a singularly dreadful work"
An earnest but C-plus tribute to an A-grade character.
"Blanchett is an extraordinary actress, and she does what she can to flesh out the material. But Charlotte is one of the least active underground operatives in movie history."
Gradually you come to realize you're trapped watching a bunch of people you don't like who stopped being funny a while ago.
This Stepford Wives has a fair share of laughs. But it has little resonance or meaning.
...increasingly resembles a vanity project.
The Book Of Eli is just one hot mess with choppy biblical undertones... The filmmakers just tried to get too deep with something that was not fully developed.
"Being Frank works so hard to make its male abuser sympathetic, while virtually ignoring the inner lives of the women unfortunate enough to be in his path, that each moment of empathy feels unearned and every laugh regrettable."
"No matter what the title says, there is no welcome waiting for you."
While Blanchette delivers an impressive and commanding performance&#44; the pretentious undertones and sluggish plot make watching this film a real challenge&#46;
"The movie is never boring and everyone works hard.But the overall effect is repetitive, i.e., quirkiness followed by more quirkiness."
"It's exactly what you're expecting, but longer, louder, and with an almost unfathomable amount of digitally created violence."
"A high caliber international cast, an Irish television director and a green screenwriter with a marketable ad concept all add up to one big slice of cheese with Vantage Point, a movie that cannot even stay the course with its own story telling devi"
"The large, talented cast is clearly thriving in the freewheeling style."
"Observing the conventions of the millennial thriller, it succeeds in amping up the suspense. Yet it never fully engages the ethical conflicts it raises."
The movie itself seems to be setting things up and establishing a tone that then it itself does not deliver. That was the biggest disappointment.
The plot might have worked if the characters had been allowed to emerge as halfway convincing people.
"Uneven Braff comedy OK, but lacks ex-citement."
"It thrives on Snyder's idiosyncrasies , and while I can't in good conscience call it a success, it's just about the best such an ill-conceived mess could've ever become."
"Feeling like a rough assembly of the deleted scenes of the film we should be watching, it's mind-numbingly flat and passionless."
...the movie is a schwing and a miss.
The cast is repeatedly abandoned ... by the go-nowhere script.
"Neither suspenseful nor scary nor action-packed, it's also a poor police procedural."
"It's entertaining enough, but director Trevor Nunn creates a collage of 1940s Britain pulled together from every other movie you've seen set during in that era."
"Just when the craziness starts to explode, the movie ends."
"Louder, dumber and even more cartoonish than the original-which is saying a lot-and you come out of it feeling as though you'd been trapped inside an explosion for a couple of hours."
This one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit.
It hasn&apos;t aged well&#46; At all&#46;
"completely devoid of charm, wit, humor, or a storyline that makes sense to anyone with even the most rudimentary of verbal skills"
"This goes on for two hours and two minutes. When I staggered out of the theater, I asked if Clinton was still president."
The predictable story is a downer.
A character plans out a 42-hour-and-11 minute journey accompanied by a 16-CD soundtrack....Elizabethtown feels every bit as long and music-saturated...
"Never exactly soars as original entertainment, although it avoids the frantic, cheeky, attention-deficit ethos of so much mass-marketed kid fare."
Grown Ups Minus 2 would be more apt.
Less than the sum of its parts.
"I do believe President Bush was actually directing this movie. It has all the hallmarks of his idea of history, pretending that enemies are villainous evildoers."
An inert simulacrum of an epic.
"""Burnt"" is overcooked. If that sounds like a glib way to describe an entertainment about the comeback of a celebrity chef, it's also perfectly suited to a movie that wears its glossiness as a badge of honor."
"A bit of working-class malarkey so unrelentingly sweet, so determinedly dotty, it makes the teeth ache."
"Home Again is a fascinating banality, the movie equivalent of a staring at a bucolic motel painting until you start to see skeletons in the haystacks."
A miscalculated mix of sleaze and schmaltz.
"For whatever reason, cleverness of any kind is dispensed with about halfway through Bones, and the film descends into standard-issue schlock 'n gore that has no rationale beyond easily induced nausea."
"The choicest dialogue in Burlesque provokes the sort of laughter that other, intentionally funny films only dream of generating."
"It's flat, formulaic and forgettable despite its fast-moving action sequences."
"An absolute disaster, morally odious on top of being aesthetically confused. But it couldn't be such a thoroughgoing failure if it wasn't swinging for the fences."
I'm still waiting for the war-on-terror thriller that has more on its mind than the threat al-Qaida poses to movie stars.
"The way that ""Muppets Most Wanted"" grabs for the green is criminal."
"White House Down is certainly junk food, but these empty calories taste awful, making it the second worst White House takedown picture of 2013. Pray there's not a third."
It's too bad that Mr. Cage couldn't tap into those powers to save himself from another bad choice in roles.
"Nobody involved ever came up with an idea or character remotely worth exploring, yet they all forged ahead anyway, placing their faith in the filmmaking process itself, and this damp squib of an ostensible movie is the decidedly lackluster result."
"An empty calorie, implausible action film with the sort of visual diarrhea most associated with Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay, Eye squanders a stunning start on a wheezing screenplay obese with mass stupidity and grand theft movie."
This is one of the most visually off-putting films ever made by a director who supposedly makes beautiful pictures.
Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz! Tom and Cam! Cruise and Diaz! Together again!
...has so little to say about (school shootings) and the culture which produces them that it becomes paradoxically tedious once the killing starts.
"In the end, Shyamalan's stumbling Lady never gives us a reason to believe."
"It's all too dumb and ribald for most tastes, but if you liked all the zombie comedies that came before, well, here's another one."
A lazy&#44; laugh-free comedy that&apos;s destined to serve as background noise for Netflix users&#46; 
"Tami-Lyn, the little boy's dream girl who is so easy to mock, despise, and dismiss, is Ted's least imaginative take on magic."
A trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home.
"If Admission had become an edgier film, I have a strange feeling that we'd be watching yet another really great Tina Fey comedy."
There is nothing presidential in Devon Terrell's very entertaining portrayal of Barry (and he is only called Barry in this film -- Barack Obama is too grand and complicated a name for this easygoing fellow).
"It's a noble tilt at Toni Morrison's complex Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. There are stunning period visuals and harrowing, sepia tinted flashbacks. But the film is overlong [and] frequently laboured."
A miserable disappointment.
Pretty. And pretty heartless.
"Richard ""Donnie Darko"" Kelly's screenplay is a fantastical, incoherent fuzz while director Tony Scott tries and fails to recapture the energy and fun of his 1993 hit, True Romance."
"Cop Out is a little too well-shot to be full-on cheesy and too much a redux to be, well, as fresh as Beverly Hills Cop or Lethal Weapon."
The movie feels like something someone can't let go off for some reason. Fascinating cast. Weak script. [Full review in Spanish].
"Fans of the real house... will find some things to cherish in the first half of ""Winchester,"" but by the time it ends, it's like a spent rifle. It made a lot of noise, and now it's empty."
"Whenever you have to draw on the former Full House dad for comedic salvation, you're seriously hurting."
"Precisely the sort of mindlessly revved-up, high-octane thing one expects from Guy Ritchie...a desecration rather than an updating."
...the film's positive attributes were for me not quite enough to make up for the movie's unrelentingly grim tone.
"When a biracial couple (America Ferrera and Lance Gross) tell their families about their engagement, everything goes awry in this formulaic flick. One particular low point: A goat at the wedding reception swallows Viagra and runs amok. Ha ha ha!"
"The details of the story are emotionally draining, but that sensation derives mostly from the situation rather than the characters."
"[It's] based on [a] memoir, but the movie comes across as a fantasy ... The female protagonist is an aspiring writer but does almost no work on her writing and instead spends most of the story obsessing over J.D. Salinger and his fan mail."
"...a cautionary tale, and as such it is unlikely to be heeded by teens anywhere and unlikely to be seen by the very parents who might learn the most from it."
So under the spell of the be-here-now philosophy of Dan Millman's New Age-y memoir from which it was drawn that it loses sight of the need to credibly dramatize the ideas.
"This, then, is where we're at: an empty hollering about obviously vile people doing obviously vile things that forgoes all artistic, political and intellectual integrity in favor of a schizophrenic inventory of crimes and corruption."
"Now comes Troy Duffy's flatulent sequel, ""The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day."" Ten years in the contemplation! It doesn't feel quite that long to sit through in its wretched entirety, but I still can't imagine any but the most easily entertained being"
It's curious that so bold a film as Alexander Payne's apocalyptic cli-fi satire Downsizing fails because of a fundamental lack of nerve. Yet here we are.
"Despite the best of intentions, a career-best performance from Kevin Costner, and outstanding work by Octavia Spencer and child actor Jillian Estell, ""Black or White"" succumbs to some of the same stereotypes it tries to dispel."
Seemingly endless movie.
"Actually less realistic and more manipulative than the director's monster NBC TV hit, ""This Is Us."""
"Makes the disastrous, franchise-altering decision to underscore how fusty Bond is by diving right into campines."
"By reinforcing her mystical qualities, it undermines her stunning efficacy as a real person who simply, and fiercely, had the courage to act."
"This retro-espionage spoof is more giggles than satirical grit, and simply lacks the comic punch and charisma, along with the pungent Cold War flavor of the times that energized the original."
"Some movies present their whole story in a two-minute trailer, but Gridiron Gang says it all in its poster ..."
Kajganich is a purveyor of pretentious piffle.
The film's problem isn't so much the grossness of its humor as the laziness with which it's executed.
"If you own a TV, you will have heard the best laughs excerpted in unrelenting commercials leading up to the movie's release."
A simplistic and utterly-predictable morality tale.
Zellweger...can only carry this film so far.
"It would take exceptionally clueless parents to buy into Thirteen's premise, while real teens will most likely treat the film with disdain."
"Benecio Del Toro is suitably brooding in this well-intentioned, credibly gothic and gory update that still feels only half right."
"The Dead Don't Die isn't the worst movie of 2019, [but] it just might represent the largest gulf between expectations and quality."
"Far too contrived, soapy and one-eyed to be taken seriously as any kind of rigorous probing of the injustices of a patriarchal world."
It's not even that the film is an unwatchable disaster -- it's just a big disappointment.
"There are minimal bursts of potential lurking in Chaos Walking's messy execution, but it doesn't deliver much but stagnant characters and dull action."
"Not the Superman movie we need, but the one we deserve."
"This fast-paced, colorful sequel knows exactly what its core audience of kiddies wants, and serves it up while treating grownups mostly as an afterthought."
"If your idea of quality cinema is a lurching, amateurishly written festival of pratfalls, smashed furniture, locker room humor and rubber owls, run don't walk to My Boss's Daughter."
"Perhaps 'Dear Evan Hansen' would work better as a straight-up drama, like 'The Spectacular Now'. I don't know. For now, these beautiful ballads crash into an ugly narrative."
Unconnected scenes begin to spin off the screen with increasing speed and with no attempt at explanation.
Mediocrity and abuse of slow motion to show off the film's costly digital effects are the keynote of a movie with no interest... except for the music. [Full Review in Spanish]
"For real thrills, rent the original, turn down the lights and scare yourself silly."
"Continues to resemble something a lewd, grouchy, fitfully indecent silent-movie director might have made for his first time using color and sound. That, at least, would explain the shouting."
If soft core porn is your thing go for it but that's about all you'll get. Not a lot of grey matter used writing the script of Fifty Shades of Grey.
"After all, what are these films if not reasonable diversions? They're also thunderously profitable diversions, but at least they're harmless."
"This is a little too slick and commanding for its own good; despite Crowe and DiCaprio's best efforts, their characters keep getting flattened by the steamroller narrative."
Beautiful Boy is so caught up in creating a general feeling of despair that we're kept at a distance from actually feeling it.
"What should have been a taut international thriller laced with an actual human component is in actuality a poorly paced, awkwardly staged and dramatically ineffective stew of generic genre goods."
This is more Steven King than it is Alfred Hitchcock and the comparison points out the difference between a master story teller and a supernatural schlockmeister who pulls unseen demons out of the air to artificially contrive the scenario.
"While the intention behind this German-Czech thriller may be admirable, too much of it focuses on the wrong story and the wrong characters."
Even Ben Stiller looks bored out of his mind.
"For the sake of your own mental health A Dangerous Method should be avoided, but the Cronenberg curious might want to endure it to prevent any onset of mania."
Ultimately it's too meandering and uneven to ever truly tug at your heart.
Willingly exploits cliches of black and Asian manhood.
"The tit-for-tat scenario ought to be wildly entertaining, but the magic is crude, the characters flyweight, and the story protracted and unpleasant."
"Before You Die, You Don't Need To See 'Rings'"
"Another misfire from the once-reliable Reiner, Alex and Emma is occasionally amusing but never makes you care."
"If someone in your household is in the midst of Pokemon fever, you'll be there. If not, not. That was easy."
"There is a line and this movie crosses it. I don't know where the line is, but it's way north of Wolf Creek."
"Had a little more distance been maintained, I Am Thor likely would have achieved a more honest account of the ascent of Jon."
"Whether intentional or not, The Sorcerer's Apprentice plays like Disney's stalled attempt to launch a stripped down Harry Potter-like franchise."
"Jim Carrey is at his annoying worst here. His manic, over-the-top style doesn't mesh well with lockerroom humor."
Quantumania starts Phase V off with a mixed bag&#44; sporting a tour-de-force villain in Kang&#44; who is smothered by a VFX mess&#44; a sluggish plot and way too many painfully weird characters&#46; 
The film's ridiculously contrived main conflict plays out with all the drama and interest of the Utah primary.
"You should be prepared for some high-minded pretension, lots of self-consciously arty shots, and long stretches of apparently profound nothingness."
"Sarsgaard and Enos are exceptional actors, but as with The Killing, Sud's focus on character over plot gradually tips The Lie into preposterousness - and the plot of We Monsters strained credulity in the first place."
"From the title and ripped off plot to Brit Robertson's Rebel Without a Cause routine, awful."
"""So smug and ponderous that even the allure of 13 performances by Cate Blanchett couldn't spur me from a stupor of annoyance and boredom."""
[Lewis'] turn as lifestyle extremist Jack carries an authentic scent of tobacco and peat while much of the movie smells of the lamp.
"Never quite thrilling, never quite dull, its overriding virtue is its competence."
"Never one to shy away from a paycheck, as evidenced by the steady string of roles in low-budget non-theatrical releases, Willis is clearly putting in the absolute minimum effort required to continue growing his bank account."
Comedy can be a deadly weapon in the wrong hands.
"Passengers is stranded in a world full of cooked up plot points and, at key times, a lack of gravity."
"I have fond memories of Louis Leterrier's cheerfully ridiculous 2013 caper Now You See Me, but I didn't really need another one."
"After Hathaway's early high point, it starts to feel numbing ..."

"While Reid is excellent and utterly uncompromising, The Mother is Mommy Drearest."
"A victim of its own bad timing, Craig M. Saavedra's buddy-comedy-cum-road-trip-flick might've had a chance back before the world started going to hell."
"The dialogue consists of almost comically generic self-help pabulum, uttered with the pseudo sincerity of someone pretending it's something enlightening. It's not."
"[It] could be fun, but it never seems to be."
"The Art Of Racing In The Rain will play well for those who consider their pets to be full-fledged family members, but otherwise this dog's journey lacks a purpose or any sense of artistry."
"Like a poorly designed videogame, it's as much a test of endurance of repetition as anything else."
"With no emotional conflict, no character revelation and only minimalist acting and episodic direction, Broken Flowers is as flat as Bill Murray's motel-room beds."
"""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,"" well acted up and down, feels caught halfway between being an idiotic spy picture for adolescents, and a reasonably grown-up thriller for reasonably grown-up grown-ups."
"It's more about memory than anything. If you recall the original, you're going to wonder why this remake was developed. If you don't, you'll wonder what the big deal is about this so-so actioner."
Dunst plays an android programmed to bestow idiosyncrasy like a Pez dispenser geeked at regular intervals.
It feels like the moviemakers went through the motions because it's time again for a holiday season cartoon for the little ones.
Reduces its complex portrait of contemporary Russia and its para-governmental organizations to a simple morality play.
"A remake that lacks creativity, hoping to trade on an established brand."
"Jane Got a Gun is being sold as a rousing feminist Western although the truth is that it's about as rousing and feminist as my cat, Daphne, who is 17, and now barely moves."
Performances are strained and scenes go on far too long.
"Much like the music videos of director Paul Hunter, making his feature-film debut here, Bulletproof Monk is flashy, forgettable fluff."
"Antebellum constantly punches down, and seems to mistake displaying racism as the same thing as criticizing it. In the end, it seems to be a missed opportunity to create a nuanced argument about the state of the country and our violent past,"
Among the innumerable movies made from King stories&#44; this one is middle-grade&#44; neither as appalling as some nor as memorable as others&#46;  It&#8217;s like a number that you see on Caller ID that you recognize&#44; but waver before answering&#46;   
Looked like a pic for tourists.
"'I'm going to eat you like a mountain lion,' says the sex-starved Bullock as she attacks Cooper in his van, moments after meeting him, in one of several appalling scenes that represent director Phil Traill's idea of cute."
"Holds a handful of chilling scenes and unforgettable images, but its cumulative effect is one of disappointment and missed opportunities."
"It's acceptable to use CGI to enhance the action, but this movie takes it over the line. When everything is artificial, it's impossible to create excitement or suspense."
"There's Samuel L. Jackson with frosty white hair snarling, 'There are ALWAYS! CONSEQUENCES!' That's worth some money, I suppose."
"Stomp the Yard panders to every cheap expectation. Actually, director Sylvain White goes a bit cheaper than his immediate predecessors, drawing out the low booty shots for giggle and jiggle effect."
"13 Hours is a movie where the questions are asked first and the shooting happens later, the opposite of Bay's usual modus operandi. Bully for him and bravo for journalism, but it doesn't make for satisfying cinema."
"The two leads create a sweet, believable romance that deserves a better movie."
Fairly stock period piece in which the cast do very little set against a stunning backdrop.
"Quirky characters and some clever plotting for an ultimate crescendo makes the film sound good on paper. However, the lazy writing and direction as the film proceeds don't do justice to the genre and its conventions."
"a work that I can only describe as a teenage girl's fantasy tale - that is, if the teenage girl suffers from an untreated bipolar disorder."
"Both taste and perspective will inform whether viewers will find The Help a revelatory celebration of interracial healing and transcendence, or a patronizing portrait that trivializes those alliances by reducing them to melodrama and facile uplift."
Hogwash American sentimentality in a film that shows raped children and brutish soldiers is both disorienting and troubling.
"What do you get when you greedily split a book in two? Long-winded filler with only pockets of tense action. Or, in Hunger Games terms: all smoke, no Girl on Fire."
Jolie doesn't vary the pace or tone much during the raft and camp sequences and while she mostly avoids POW movie cliches she doesn't find much to put in their place to explain Zamperini's fortitude.
"For a movie looking to raise a clenched fist against technology, Transcendence feels more like a limp handshake with the devil."
The mash-up of cowboys and aliens doesn't do either camp any favors. How are we supposed to work up a rooting interest when both sides are shooting blanks?
The story is confined to one location and our main character has been rendered mute and static.
Less like a triumphant homecoming than the last gasp of a flatlining franchise.
"More than anything, The Cable Guy is simply uncomfortable. It's Ace Ventura as the evil bad guy."
"Even accepting that Close looks a bit like a fey, mummified Stan Laurel, viewers have to assume that everybody in Ireland suffers from poor eyesight to fall for THIS ruse."
It has the radiant glow of a Hollywood pitch meeting.
"Nobody on-screen has much fun with ""After Earth."" And neither do we."
"Despite Jones' performance, it's a disappointing biopic"
De Palma loyalists are defending this movie; I assume it's just out of habit.
"The well-made but frustrating Triple Frontier, which takes its title from the intersection of the borders of Brazil, Peru and Colombia, has almost everything going for it but depth, focus and gravitas."
"The Fantastic Four is a longtime entity and, for some, a fan favorite in the Marvel universe. It definitely deserves better treatment than the cinematic universe has given it so far."
"The most dispiriting thing about ""Something Borrowed"" is that with a little more art, craft and wit it could have been a lot better, maybe even good."
I like Miley Cyrus. I like her in spite of the fact that she's been packaged within an inch of her life.
Let's hope this movie hasn't come out too early in the year to be remembered for a well-deserved Razzie.
"Van Damme may have been an excellent martial artist (he had fought as an amateur and professionally for several years before entering the movies), but he was no actor."
With any luck this will be the spanner that finally jams up the works of Hollywood's dangerously overcranked '80s remake Wurlitzer.
How disappointing.
"Describing what's bad about this movie is like describing what's orange about an orange, but suffice it to say that the best performance is given by a crucified raccoon."
"Pilgrimage remains a relatively suspenseless, emotionally uninvested Christian tale rife with orchestrated bloodshed of the sort that HBO would reject for visceral quality assurance purposes."
"""Carter"" is so good-natured, and so goofy, that it's hard to completely dislike. But impossible, I think, to understand."
"This ill-conceived, frequently irritating biopic trots out every stale genre chestnut while focusing on a relentlessly unlikable main character who comes across as a stubborn, argumentative bully. "
It's all more wearying than fun.
"Should Wood decide to indulge his manic side again, here's hoping he picks a better vehicle than Maniac."
Packed with enervating action sequences and inexplicable scripting decisions.
"Too much of the action in Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit takes place on laptops, thumb drives, and video monitors."
"The more you think about it, the quicker it falls to pieces."
"Stupid on an epic scale or epic on a stupid one, Land of the Lost is as close as Will Ferrell comes these days to a 'kid friendly' movie."
The felonies fall apart due to phenomenal stupidity - and audiences are supposed to laugh at the extreme amateurishness of this band of beefy crooks.
Having Captain Jack Sparrow step onto the scene would have been far more believable.
"The action scenes are forgettable, the mythology is confusing and the bad taste comedy is hopelessly off-target."
"This is smarmy and sentimental. And repugnant, starting with the premise."
A classic women's pic that strings together a collection of syrupy clichés that can make a real man double up in pain.
"Filled with characters you'd thankfully only find in a bad romantic comedy, Because I Said So is an unbelievable, unenjoyable mess."
...The 355 just isn't a good film.
A conventional and entirely dishonest turn of events ... undermine[s] everything that has come before in Looking for Eric.
"Given how fresh the pain of Philip Seymour Hoffman's passing still feels, it's perhaps a relief that gloomy tragicomedy God's Pocket - which marks one of his final roles - never engages seriously with the reality of death."
"As a feel-bad holiday comedy, The Ice Harvest sometimes recalls Thornton's own Bad Santa, though it's never as outrageously funny, and Thornton doesn't get nearly as much to do."
A spineless bit of populist garbage that tries to mine broad cheer from the murder of an irritating old lady.
"It is dull and generic which is a real shame because the cast is talented and the premise has potential to be weird and exciting. In the end, its just forgettable."
Maybe they both could lose? Don't wish for too much.
"One of Apatows strengths is digging into the humanity of his characters, but there just isnt much of worth to be mined here. Ultimately, his idea probably would have been better off in the hands of a director more adept at zippy satire."
"The overlong piece goes off in all directions needlessly, confusing the audience without handing us a villain who is at all believable."
"The words are catchy and the beat keeps you awake, though all of it quickly fades."
'Alien Nation' fails to offer the viewer more than a vague entertainment. [Full Review in Spanish]
"As a thriller it's not that thrilling. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Sex, Profanity, etc. - Also Available)"
"Penguin Bloom is meant to be an inspiring film, and to some degree, it is. However it is too slow, predictable, and flat out boring to be worth a watch."
"The problem is that with the course of time, the director's speach has become very thin, and for a few moments it looks like a self-parody. [Full review in spanish]"
"This dark comedy makes a few smart observations about the lengths people will go to snag the American Dream, but its satiric edge gets dulled rather quickly."
One of the most inept sequels in recent memory. Even the cast can't save this one.
"In crafting its scares, The Vigil settles for far too many tropes. It's especially disappointing given the unique and intriguing setup."
"It's all good-natured enough, except for a weekend at Grandpa's retirement village which is truly cringe-making, but it can all be seen on TV any night of the week."
"The latest iteration of ""Fantastic Four"" is far from what its name suggests. Profoundly uninteresting, it hits all the beats of the standard superhero movie, but provides nothing in the way of imagination or magic."
"If it had been more elegant in its storytelling, it could have been a fun genre crossover, but the best efforts of Steers and his cast can't turn the overstuffed book into a film that makes any real sense."
"A blast of Holly-Kong glitz that never approaches the stylistic cohesiveness of, say, John Woo's Face/Off or the charisma of that film's propulsive star John Travolta."
"I wanted to watch one of the great comic geniuses of the last 50 years make me laugh, and I got stuck watching Steve Martin in a wetsuit being dragged behind a boat. Life's full of disappointments, isn't it?"
"An innocuous, inconsequential bit of fluff...notable for both its energetic but predictable court action and an unfortunate lack of chemistry between the leads."
"It's a laboured, glossy affair in which the complexity and challenge of Lili's process of becoming are buried under a glaze of sumptuous design and arch acting."
"Save your money and, more important, your precious time."
There is no life in these scenes-none of the gumption that must have fueled Mary's early decisions.
"Only Penélope Cruz can shine in this bland, fragmented series of snapshots. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"""Act of Valor"" is a competently directed action movie, but forcing the audience to wear such narrow goggles is a dereliction of duty."
The film's climax ultimately seems less an example of its protagonist's irrational fury than of cockeyed storytelling.
"A routine thriller marred by inconsistent performances, a sluggish pace and stylistic flourishes that frequently feel affected."
"Season of the Witch begins in a Crusade taking place after the Crusades, in a 14th Century for Dummies about as immersive and real as the Ohio State Renaissance Festival."
"The film doesn't have a 'plot' so much as it has a series of weak, pointless scenes that aren't funny, don't develop the characters and don't further the story."
"All we get is unintentionally hilarious dialogue in which the characters speak lines that not only seem to have been torn straight from the tag lines of movie posters, they seem to have been selected exclusively from films that went direct-to-video."
Unmemorable and mostly generic.
A real snoozer.
"Deepwater Horizon, saddled with a collection of one-dimensional mouthpieces, proves unable to generate the thrills one might've anticipated in its action-heavy second half..."
"At best, it's an example of what not to do with your low-budget slasher flick."
"More and more about acknowledging that Bergman wasn't a great person... which Searching basically shrugs off because artists, right?"
"Those interested in the abrupt rise and fall of Internet commerce may recognize familiar themes and even draw comfort from the story arc, but for a general audience the entertainment factor is quite low."
An unimaginative plot and a cast of unbelievably wholesome jailbirds.
Dolan's idea of how to build suspense involves shadowy close-ups and keeping his scene partner out of the frame.
Egregiously self-indulgent and mawkish fairy tale.
"[A] cheesy, predictable thriller..."
It's good ol' fashion Oscar bait: beautiful to look at; hard to watch.
"At this point ""Kate"" feels like a routine exercise in the overworked assassin genre. Been there, killed that."
Never have I seen a more lifeless presentation of a Shakespeare play.
Falls smack-dab in the middle of terminal disposability.
"If The Blair Witch Project signalled a new dawn of horror, Blair Witch is the loud death rattle of a once exciting sub-genre, disappearing into the darkness."
"The script is blaring and obvious at all times, and in his second directorial effort, David Schwimmer doesn't have a clue how dull it is for the audience to endure scene after scene of anguish, crying and screaming matches."
"Because it fails on so many levels, one wonders why ""See Spot Run"" wasn't put to sleep during development."
"The film is, in the end, like a roller-coaster ride: it's dizzying and thrilling but you don't go anywhere. It's a series of such glittering but hollow exchanges between characters who always look and act like characters."
"It's hard to believe Irresistible was shot only just over a year ago - while blandly watchable, it feels tired and off-the-pulse, an instant irrelevancy."
"Bravely riding full speed ahead, Biker Fox nevertheless ends up in the very same place."
The most amazing thing about this by this idiotic sci-fi thriller is that the actors do not crack up when delivering their lines.
"As always, Refn's style is captivating, but the fascination with extreme gore never amounts to more than a fetish, and there's none of the deft characterization that made his revered Pusher trilogy and British biopic Bronson so engaging."
"Like the titular doll, this thing's off the shelf."
A multi-million dollar fiasco.
Paprika is for dyed-in-the-wool anime fans only. Others will likely see it for what it is -- a pretentious piece of animated nonsense.
The type of strictly formulaic buddy-action-comedy that should have slipped through the cracks and gone to straight-to-video hell.
"Based on the sleeper bestseller by Canadian author William P. Young, The Shack offers an enlightening - if dispiriting - vantage on contemporary, non-denominational Christianity."
"A drama that wears its gritty poetry on its sleeve like a macho film-school merit badge, trivializing war, trauma and addiction with its veneration of style over psychological complexity."
A horse of a different color!
The concept is rich but this virus thriller lacks savvy execution... and thrills.
Steve Carell with a puppy down his pants in a role that Will Ferrell must have turned down.
What really killed me is that I hardly laughed at all&#46; 
"The trouble with celebrating old-fashioned entertainment is that Scardino needs to complete the hardest trick in Hollywood - making clichs seem fresh and funny. Sadly, the director is no David Copperfield..."
As visually great as &#8220;Strange World&#8221; is&#44; the story underneath isn&#8217;t as strange as it needs to be&#46;
"...Pacific Rim is rather generic, familiar and cliche-ridden; ambitious ideas and spectacular designs wrapped up in a banal and tediously told story that's as clamorous, loud and disorienting as any Michael Bay movie..."
"It's a paradox, but science fiction has to make sense: It can rest on the world's most outlandish premise, but only if its internal logic holds up to scrutiny. And Jumper can't make that leap."
"A film no one will remember, not even the people who star in it."
"A Rainy Day In New York is a wisp of a film, so lightweight it almost flies away at times, and is yet another reminder that Allen's best work is long behind us."
"Manages to disappoint as the pair sleepwalk through the film, seemingly unaware of how abjectly unfunny it is."
"It still is a sad commentary that so much creative energy should have gone into such a sordid, kinky and ultimately demoralizing look at such bizarre facets of human nature both on the screen and in the audience."
[It's] certainly an immersive experience that's decidedly difficult to shake. The problem is that it's also the most excruciating sit in recent cinematic memory.
"I doubt The Gunman will do much to advance Penn's foray into action-hero bankability, and that's probably a good thing. He's too fine an actor to be mired in nonstop shootouts while flashing his pecs and looking scowly."
"...its CGI is frankly cartoonish, while the composites that make up that surfboard ride down Wilshire Boulevard are...unconvincing..."
The most surprising aspect of Hollow Man is the fact that Shue agreed to work in such garbage.
"Has obviously been hacked to pieces and is hampered by lazy supporting performances, several utterly pointless scenes and the fact that all the violence happens offscreen."
"The drama that ""Freeheld"" unsuccessfully strives for ultimately can't compete with the far-more-compelling facts that inspired it."
"Streep puts on an impeccable accent and finds plenty of emotional depth, but the oddly structured film never goes beyond a surface look at Thatcher's political career."
Possibly one of the most annoying movies I've seen in recent years. [Full review in Spanish]
"Falk is good, but this is ultimately an exercise in shameless manipulation."
Sandler unfortunately brings nothing new to the table.
Crowe is a commanding lead actor who could have made it into something special if he'd stayed out of his own way. Maybe he should have stayed home. You should.

The film winds up muffling its own powerful protest.
Could we please try telling a decent story for a change instead of worrying so much about setting up a damn franchise?
"You're likely to leave this movie wondering what you've just watched, as if you've been abused worse than the poor kidnapped girl."
...the most disappointing Sparks adaptation since 2002's A Walk to Remember...
"Kimi, the new thriller from director Steven Soderbergh, is an ordinary genre piece — so ordinary that not even its insistent topicality can make it seem more compelling."
"In an age when more and more movies just feel like stepping-stones toward the next, bigger things, is it so much to ask that it be a good movie all on its own?"
This laser gun story misfires.
Khandaani Shafakhana puts too much pressure on Sonakshi Sinha. She is in almost every frame of the film. We see her in close-up - literally and figuratively. But her performance is largely confined to pouting and scowling.
Every comic turn is predictable-from the electrocuted cat to the Scrooge-ified ending.
"The Edge of Love is the sort of muddled melodrama that has little to say about love, or anything else."
[T]he most unnecessary remake since Gus van Sant's peculiar shot-for-shot remake of Psycho...
Horns is the sort of concept that just didn't translate effectively from page to screen.
A feeble entry into the teen-movie lexicon.
"The show, no matter how fantastical, was about something real. The movie is about Hollywood."
The gaps in logic are more like crevasses and they occur right up to the credits.
"Tonally schizoid and rife with anachronisms (a David Bowie song on the sound track, out-of-era vernacular), Tarantino's Third Reich folly is utterly exasperating."
The problem isn&#8217;t so much that the quantum realm looks unreal&#59; it&#8217;s more that it looks unrealized&#44; unfinished&#46; Digital doodles&#46;
"Just when Joe Dirt thought it had a lock on being this year's worst film, along comes Jeepers Creepers snatching that distinction from its grasp."
Irresistible is little more than a cinematic monument to how much the current movement has passed Jon Stewart and his obsession with media failings by. He is still focusing on the symptoms of society's ills instead of the disease itself.
Who needs all that noise??
"Instead of cranking up the suspense, the film turns into mush."
"Despite a good amount of balance allowing for the expression of some anti-American sentiment, Voices of Iraq comes down squarely on the side supporting the war in Iraq."
"The picture is entertaining enough, but its cloying goodness will make you yourself feel like a problem child."
"This unbearably cutesy and hackneyed movie is a vanity piece starring, and written and directed by, mild sitcom presence Josh Radnor."
"I was so tempted to walk out of License to Wed. And I have never walked out of a movie, not in my ten-year career as a film critic, not before."
"Pretty much the Marley and Me of this holiday season, except in the place of an adorable yellow lab there's adorable Robert De Niro."
"Diverting but dumb and more goth than gothic, Blade: Trinity builds up to a less-than-epochal smackdown."
"A determined historical sweep masks a small-minded bid for easy outrage and heartstrings-pulling in the schematic World War II drama ""Walking With the Enemy."""
Summoning sympathy for poor-little-obnoxious-rich-man Drew is nearly as difficult as swallowing Grandma's decade-old fruitcake.
[I] wanted to reach up to the screen and switch Bratt off.
"Clichéd, bland and a slog."
"The director, Christopher Cain, brings not a hint of irony to any of this -- not even to the Vegas finale in which Dusty is supposed to rescue himself from glitz."
Eventually sunk by its cobbled-together premise and the filmmakers' inability to deliver an appropriate payoff.
"Any time...personal history is touched upon, it is quickly shoved under the carpet in favor of yet another sailing montage, complete with compulsory sunset."
"The stage show was the usual product of the R. & H. collaboration... In the movie nothing of value has been eliminated, but nothing of interest has been added."
"A drippy romance, spending the vast majority of its time in private, two-hander scenes imagining inane dialogue between a dead Princess and a famously reclusive, private surgeon; it only exists because it knows neither of them is going to complain."
Maybe the less said about Don't Say a Word the better.
"When it comes to overexposure, Stiller ranks up there with Janet Jackson's right breast."
"Feels oddly perfunctory, despite valiant turns from Carey Mulligan and Helena Bonham Carter."
"At the very least, it is a complete waste of time."
Terminator Genisys fails to provide what this series has needed for a full quarter-century: the soul of a new machine.
"If making movies like this for himself is the reason Downey makes movies like The Shaggy Dog for us -- well then, that's a bargain that benefits no one."
the film's supernatural dread might have escalated even more had it been tied to the characters' own psyches
"Predictable, if disappointing, considering the star power."
"This is not so much a movie as sending-off party in which everyone has been invited, even people who do not matter that much, and no one can remember the theme."
"Richard Benjamin's strategy in directing ''Little Nikita'' seems to have been to paper over the holes in the plot with routine moves from spy shows past, in hopes of making the improbable passable."
"As cute and energetic as it is, ""The Lego Movie"" is more exhausting than fun, too unsure of itself to stick with any story thread for too long."
"No movie star appears to have more fun in a crap movie than John Travolta, and his inimitable my-check-has-cleared! glee is the best thing about this lame espionage thriller."
"The good bits are like the seeds that end up on the bottom of bird cages, tasty tidbits momentarily visible before getting covered in crap."
"It's a hectic, sour and muddled film - a flailing counterfeit of satire that keeps slipping on its own banana skin supply, and never remotely gets to grips with what it thinks it's sending up."
"After your heart has been beaten, bludgeoned, anally raped and stomped upon, there's still another hour left to go..."
"Ultimately falls flatter than a floppy disk, relying solely on style to divert attention from the lack of an original plot."
The characters stop just short of speaking directly to the camera and scolding the audience.
I think the film is so worried about us not having an uplifting cinematic experience that it never risks presenting the ugliest parts of Vance's culture as unmitigatedly ugly.
"Don't you hate it when you're holed up in a bathroom with two egocentric guys snorting coke and kibitzing about the meaning of life and their failing love lives? Me, too."
"A slow, episodic endurance contest of a film that has one thing going for it -- scenery."
Every frame aims to be a visual poem and the film sums up in sweaty sensuality. [Full review in Spanish]
"[An] absolutely bewildering waste of time, talent, energy and money."

Soap.
"Turner at least has a natural ease with the camera and a sense of the character, but everyone else either hopelessly overplays or is so resolutely laid back they almost fall off the screen."
Blackhat feels like the vehicle that Mann wanted to explore the hacking world but the casting and the script's counterintuitive motivations it mutated away from his intent. It's a shame.
A tiresome and unnecessary dated remake&#46;
"Suburbicon is not only unfunny, a bad sign for a black comedy, but deep-dyed dislikable."
"Even with its over-the-top spirit, The Independent's sense of spoof quickly goes flat."
"It's hard not to be disappointed with ""I Do."" The territory is obviously well-worn, and while the heart is there, for the most part, the film is surprisingly light on the laughs."
"Flickers of incoherence serve as foreshadowing for the chaotic climax, which doesn't resemble Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey as much as it does The Shining."
"The Return doesn't have enough scares to be a good thriller, and it doesn't have the depth to work on an arty level. This isn't a bad movie; it's just painfully thin."
"""Pixels"" may feel flatter to kids of the '80s than it does to moviegoers too young to have known Pac-Man from Ant-Man."
"Apatow and Green are just throwing whatever they can at the screen, to see what will get either a laugh or a grimace. More likely the latter, since you'll likely leave the theatre wondering if you saw a comedy or a Sam Peckinpah movie."
"(Casey) Affleck is adequate as the lead, although I kept wondering how much lower Buscemi could take Jim."
"Despite the consistency of the film's droll take on murder and mayhem, it still feels oddly uneven and skimpy, as if there just isn't quite enough meat on its narrative bones."
There's the core of a fascinating amoral movie here before it gets amped up into a standard thriller
"While some of its individual, gross out moments will probably be remembered, the film itself is too easily forgotten."
The filmmakers are so intent on formulating a grand argument in favor of nontraditional families that they sacrifice most of their story's momentum and coherence to do it.
Not even half a dozen Oscar winners and nominees can save a story that manages to be both formulaic and convoluted.
"For a movie as short as it is, Italian Studies a slog and a half that is hoisted by Vanessa Kirby's captivating performance and some technical aspects."
"Sentiment isn't enough. You need believable characters, good dialogue and consistent performances, and they're not always found in this film."
"I usually bypass puns based upon a film's title, but here I can't help myself: Aeon Flux is a flux-up of prodigious proportions."
"Enjoyment will vary vastly depending on where you fall on the schlocky humor spectrum and your Cage-tolerance level, but it's all surprisingly empty and forgettable."
"Horror fans may be disappointed by this handsome exorcism drama, which aspires to the serious religious feeling of William Friedkin's The Exorcist but delivers little of its shock or gore."
"Danger doesn't quite translate into sustained drama here, in part because the reliance on voiceover distances us from the action."
The screenplay has such unspeakable dialogue that you don't even believe in the characters you're watching.
"All in all, not quite as good as it gets."
"How these guys are broken by their babies is hit-and-miss comedy, but the film's element of truth ... keeps it from sailing off the screen like the gas from its oh-so-many flatulence jokes."
"Musters only a few lackluster laughs...[but] has one trump card: it's a kid-friendly, ""PG"" film that celebrates museums."
Dragged Across Concrete is an admittedly distinctive but ultimately mediocre movie that provides far more empty calories of exploitation than genuine food for thought.
"Instead of chasing laughs, ""Accepted"" gets preachy about the pressures of getting into college and the pressures of attending college."
Seems too slight and shallow to really work as a drama.
Sparkling but slight glimpse into the lives of the lusty female dancers of the music video world.
"Overall, 'Black Easter' is somewhat goofy yet fun to watch just to while away time."
"Tyler Perry's The Single Moms Club is a sitcom masquerading as a feature film. And given Perry's snowballing small-screen presence, an eventual TV show of it would be no surprise."
"The director Carl Hunter, formerly the bassist of the Liverpudlian band the Farm, puts rather too much faith in quirkiness to see the film through."
Just rent ADVENTURELAND (a better coming-of-age movie) and the WOODSTOCK documentary (a better depiction of the festival) instead of wasting your time on this.
"Everything feels begged, borrowed and stolen from other better movies, from Quentin Tarantino's exclamation-point violence to the slo-mo bullet trajectory shots from The Matrix."
"Would be wholly unbearable if it weren't for Krasinski, who is on the scene with his goofy, bulbous nose and perfect comedic timing to partially redeem the almost unwatchable."
"Michael Clayton wants it both ways. It requires smarts to understand what's going on, and a lack of smarts to care and not be able to predict the outcome."
The derivative and dim-witted Blood and Chocolate at least provides a practical metaphor for its own detrimental impact on cinema culture.
The Informers becomes that rare movie that is so tedious it dares you to keep watching.
"Features moments so light, they alone could lift the economy."
"It's mangled into an Omen-lite disaster area, thanks to a script torn between making a moral point about cloning and cheap shocks."
"There's repetitious talk about forgiving and forgetting, and debate over which is preferable, but Solondz doesn't seem particularly interested in either."

Tedious - it's a total waster of time and talent...
"It might thrill those who haven't seen Hooper's original version, but there's no reason not to go back and find that one instead. It's simply better than this inferior attempt to cash in."
"Feel vindicated in the mad incongruity of popular foreign policies advocating war with ""the other"" for the sake of the innocents."
Stuber is one of those difficult movies to review. It is not good; it is not bad. It just ... is.
Te story is efficient but strangely uninvolving and not nearly as scary as the Korean version.
"This film just doesn't stop moving. The camera swirls around every shoot-out, every fight, every conversation. Nothing is still. Everyone shouts. The tone is hysterical and everyone is angry."
"Not even Robert De Niro can save this awful, lazy excuse for a thriller, which starts out tedious and quickly spirals into insulting stupidity."
"Undoubtedly gorgeous to look at. It's just a shame that it doesn't do nearly enough to hook, before laboriously meandering to its foreseeable conclusion."
"What we witness onscreen is horrifying and deeply disturbing (as it should be), but a little more context might help us to not feel so marooned."
Wince-inducing.
"Unfortunately, it is a tedious story with unrelatable characters and a script that make you wonder how it ever made it onto the big screen in the first place. It's just a waste of time."
works best as an Italian dramedy with its history used as window dressing and any original thought kept happily to itself.
Transfixed is interested in blood and gore and sexual titillation rather than character development or psychological depth.
"For every solid rib tickler, there are about three bits that make the film's brief running time seem a lot longer."
"He likes Social Distortion, she likes Alanis Morrissette. And quite frankly, either ""Ball and Chain"" or ""Isn't it Ironic"" are both better takes on the modern relationship."
"It's basically a 106-minute in-joke on the studio system heyday, complete with lovely period details of sets, costumes and visual effects."
"Paul Anderson, the director of such previous sci-fi turkeys as Event Horizon, Soldier and Mortal Combat, is back again with another loud, over-the-top picture."
"Because Lee is so quick to jump around, it leaves a lot uneven."
Oh Mr. De Niro...it hurts to see you like this.
"It wants to be Good Will Hunting set in the land of Entourage, but its bummed-out touchy-feeliness is every bit &#8232;as concocted as its overly jaded showbiz corruption."
"For Miike freaks only (and you know who you are). Everyone else: Stay far, far away."
A movie that thinks it's pretty smart but is really too dumb to hold together beyond its first few minutes.
"The spirit of inconsequential whimsy prevails throughout, with recurrent shots of traffic and the New York skyline helping blend different sensibilities into a multinational soup."
"Its retro melding of [The Conjuring and Insidious] with a heavy dose of Carrie-style telekinetic mayhem doesn't result in anything particularly memorable. Apart from the Slade, that is."
"A close-up portrait of disaffected youth in Middle America, Gummo is one of the most repellent cinematic efforts in recent memory."
much of Killer Elite is flummoxed by its own make-up
"Vulgar, unbalanced and short on laughs, Fist Fight entertains when the actual fight begins, but the rest just doesn't work. [Full review in Spanish]"
This is less a reimagining than a reanimation of the long dead corpse of an idea.
Damon Gameau copies the Super Size Me model for an investigatory experiment [with] more style and pizzazz and inconsistency.
"The overall tone is so uneven, and that blaring rock soundtrack so intrusive, the artistry of Miss Hokusai gets lost in translation."
A by-the-numbers action film that's not nearly as strong as its Damon-led predecessors.
Chronicle of an Escape pretty much lives up to its title and little else.
Racing Stripes is pretty standard family fare without too many charming moments.
Noel Coward's ghost might not return to haunt the makers of this new adaptation of his classic play but it's not hard to imagine the Master turning in his grave at some of the liberties director Edward Hall and his three screenwriters have taken.
Top-notch effects and a bottom-scraping script make this disaster flick a spectacular bore.
"After all the build up, just when you think we’re finally going to dive deeper, it simply ends, leaving much to be desired."
Dead cold
A very respectful sequel to Spielberg's original that offers constant entertainment but never really wows the audience. [full review in Spanish]
"""Why?! Why?!"" screams Morgan Freeman and you, the viewer."
"Disappointing that Ball didn't have someone offering good advice on handling material that will constantly have you groaning, ""What was the point?"""
The good news about the Robin Williams comedy RV is that it's not as bad as the TV commercials make it seem.
"A grueling experience, but not for the reason intended."
"There's a lot going on here, very little of it the least bit interesting."
"Elegantly gloomy but ultimately unsatisfying gothic rural horror that is all too-static mood. Tom Hughes makes a valiant go of a descent into madness, but the character is little more than his misery."
"The Ice Harvest is too tepid to have much taste either way, and it ends up lulling us to apathy."
"One capably staged chase sequence apart, it's not one to set the pulse racing."
"A glossy, paint-by-numbers portrait best hung in a bank lobby. Taymor seems to forget that what defined Kahlo's artistic output was the terrible pain she endured..."
It simply doesn't have the sharp inventiveness and insight we usually associate with the franchise.
"The movie is claimed ... by narrative incoherence, Tim Burton-envy and the usual demons of digital effects."
"Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny."
Disney's animated pirate tale has masterful visuals -- and an amateur's script.
"Sophie Scholl: The Final Days wants to avoid the sentiment that is inherent in the details of her tragic demise, but in doing so, it's leeched the emotional power out of her life and death."
Unfortunately Sandler and Wolf have given us nothing new. We are subjected to the same old sight gags we've all seen too many times.
How is it that Elvis has become the go-to sign of boys' obsessions?
It&apos;s further proof&#44; as if any were needed&#44; of &quot;SNL&quot; producer Lorne Michaels&apos; contempt for the audience&#46;
"Over Her Dead Body may be the worst romantic comedy I've ever seen, although I hesitate to make such a resolute pronouncement about a movie that's so barely even there."
"Violent, unsurprising thriller lacks tension despite twist."
"A lot of stuff happens on Skull Island, but none of it makes much sense, so there's no emotional movement."
"The creepy premise is rendered almost ineffective through weak, factory-issued dialogue and a disappointing finale."
The movie plays simply on the surface.
"A minimum effort horror movie. It does just enough to scare easily unnerved thirteen-year-old girls, and not much else."
...grimacing is about all Franco manages.
[An] ungainly Manhattan fairy tale.
"Stone has missed the moment with his belated sequel ... Instead of being ahead of the game, he's now lagging behind [and] he's made a movie that already seems out of date."
"Narratively, the story is dumbly predictable, but some choices made in its telling are fresh."
The dark force behind this movie is the relentless power of cliche.
"Without a consistent tone or any real measure of emotional consistency, Practical Magic occasionally manages to bubble, but it's barely worth the toil and trouble."
"David's a family man who never asked to play a central role in this story. By the end of ""The Tax Collector,"" it's hard to blame him."
This set of 'In-Laws' are stuck with each other -- but we have a choice. The right one opened in 1979.
"On January 26th, I have witnessed what is assured to be the worst film I will behold all year."
"Translates as sumptuous, hollow, overlong and dull."
"The script is a patchwork quilt: sometimes winsome, sometimes wisecracking, sometimes serious, usually just silly."
Full Grown Men doesn't even make childhood seem like all that much fun.
"I found it to be more irritating than scary, more tedious than exciting."
Parental Content Review
"It's supposed to look stylish, a film noir... but a psychological thriller cannot live by mood and atmosphere alone."
"Sadly, tragically, Early Man is just not very good."
"While the action itself is vividly shot and often quite tense, the characters are so thinly drawn that it's impossible to connect with them, much less care about whether they make a clean getaway with their stolen millions."
Anyone with the mental capacity to make it to high school will be embarrassed by the ineptness on display here.
"This stately chiller owes a lot to 1960s British flicks like ""The Innocents"" and ""The Haunting,"" but unfortunately heads towards cliches with every step."
"The kind of film that knows where its strengths reside, and how viewers are likely to react."
"While the first third of the film unfurls from Anna's perspective, including the effect the societal breakdown has on her control over her children, the rest is more general and much less interesting."
"Witherspoon is a genuine fireball, and it takes a lot to muffle her high spirits in a blanket of bland. So congratulations, Home Again. Against all odds, you've done it."
... an inevitably dated contemplation of the complexities of the American occupation of Iraq ...
I'll save you a couple of hours and tell you its message: Life can be a bummer. Deal with it.
"It is the worst kind of bad movie. It's not actively, confidently, exuberantly bad, in a way that engages with you and forces you to react in some way. It's passively bad."
"A ridiculous amount of the plot involves what I call the Magical Hacker Trope: a computer boffin uses her smartphone, laptop or other gizmo to do things Bill Gates never dreamed of as she unlocks doors, cars and computers on the fly, anywhere..."
The Skeleton Key delivers its share of cheap scares but never unlocks the door to the creepiness that would have made this is memorable movie-going experience.
Even the film's most ardent champions would likely concede that The Interview is a spectacularly weird film to end up at the center of a free speech brouhaha.
"Although this film has a simple and predictable story setup, it takes a long time to develop. The first part of the film has a rather slow pace."
"No movie starring these actors could possibly be all that bad. But Quartet is tepid when it wants to be sophisticated, a slow-moving, middlebrow endeavor."
"Dig if you must, but this is fool's gold."
"Those hoping for a knockabout action movie in the mould of the similarly set Sherlock Holmes will be sorely disappointed by this po-faced, moody, broody and sometimes slow film."
Selena Gomez is so laughably bad that Miley Cyrus twerking at the VMAs is only the second-most-awkward performance by a former Disney star this week.
Put Bruce Willis and this bewildering World War II movie in front of the firing line.
"Loud, hyperactive, almost incoherent, and with little to do with the games it's supposedly inspired by. [Full review in Spanish]"
"...without the continuing presence of Arnold and without any notable relationships, the movie is mostly noisy, blaring battles."
[An] atrocious misadventure in teen self-absorption...
Should be an engaging picture of the backrooms of power and the machinations that brought down a government but instead it is a talky affair that relies on exposition rather than thrills.
"By the time I got to the big plot payoff, I had lost interest in ""Serenity,"" its characters and whatever the payoff was going to be."
Blows any intrigue by piling on one gangster movie clich after another.
"A movie that features such old-fashioned comedic virtues can be refreshing, which makes it even more unfortunate that this particular G-rated comedy contains sexually suggestive humor and references."
It's quite a paradox that someone so acutely attuned to racism would so enthusiastically embrace the worst clichs of homophobia and misogyny.
"What is clear, however, is that Old is nowhere near the project many were hoping it would be and will leave many audience members and long-time Shyamalan fans shaking their heads. "
"It's refreshing to see an all black cast, in a film that places black women's stories front and centre; it's just a shame that the stories are such downers."
"In the latest from Netflix, Wine Country, a lot of funny women are brought together for little to no laughs"
"If there's a single spontaneous moment, I can't recall it."
"There are powerful moments along the way, even if the overall impact is slight and forgettable."
"Apparently, plowing through this much treacle is enough to gum up any mortal coil."
At least Disney was smart enough to cast Jolie. She has a genuinely heroic presence. If only the movie were equal to it.
It's handsome looking but stilted and pointless.
Uma triste ironia do Cinema que a nica colaborao entre Sturges e Wayne tenha sido neste policial urbano medocre que j nasceu anacrnico.
"It's refreshing to see a premise such as this one treated to a nonsmarmy telling. But the picture, intelligent but mild, has more of a 10-volt hum than a true spark."
The Rum Diary is too muted to convey the intensity that propelled Thompson past most of the other magazine feature writers of his boozy era.
Ends up feeling like a tossed-off Judd Apatow photocopy.
Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona exploits an international tragedy to tell a syrupy story about a wealthy white family dealing with adversity while completely ignoring the thousands of others who suffered as much or worse.
"Where to Invade Next is arguable at every turn, which can be said of all of Moore's movies, but this one doesn't seem worth the effort."
"There is only so long this concept can last - which, in truth, is around 20 minutes, never mind three bloody movies!"
"Biblically classical, tastefully vintage with aerial shots of wet umbrellas and Homburg hats and not a little staid considering its sensational source material, Changeling isn't so much dull as it is an open book."
"Those who get a catch in the throat just thinking about Valentines Day might not mind slogging through this epic... Everyone else will emerge from ""Bicentennial"" feeling about 200 years older than they were when they went in."
Add Suicide Squad to the growing list of summer 2016 disappointments.
"The role of Marcel Marceau should have been a highpoint of Eisenberg's career ambitions the way playing Charlie Chaplin was for Robert Downey Jr. Unfortunately, Eisenberg appreciates Marceau's art only for its historical utility."
"Angst-filled melodrama...as Carl Sagan would say: ""Deus Ex Machina."""
Swings further into the goofy abyss than necessary.
"An example of shamelessly bad screenwriting, laden with coincidence and clich and empty characterizations."
The film's eagerness to please... pushes everything into caricature and spoils its own based-on-reality claim.
"All the ingredients for a perfectly reasonable comedy would appear to be in place, but nothing catches fire, basically because Hart really has no one to play off."
"A depressing, dour film."
"You'll either love it or you'll admire it, while wishing it would calm down and, I don't know, maybe pick up a book for a while."
"Cecil B. de Mille's vastly expanded remake of his 1923 silent epic takes three hours and thirty-nine minutes to sit through, and the time, for me, often dragged heavily."
"The more sequels spun off, the clearer it becomes that one movie about these swashbucklers would have sufficed."
"if I were responsible for the maintenance of American prestige abroad, [I would] ban this picture out of hand, before it has a really disastrous effect in foreign countries."
"Since the natural audience for this is girls under 18, do they really need the message that brains are a bad thing, dooming them to a dateless high school career?"
Spritely scenarios are drowned out by the manic mayhem.
"Also the Predictables, the Forgettables and they kinda look like the Anabolic Steroidables..."
It makes sense that this Spanish-lingo farce plays very much like an SNL sketch. The only problem is that it packs about as many laughs into its 85 minutes as a good skit does in eight or 10.
The cold distance that LaBute brings to the material keeps the viewer at arms' length.
"It's a constipated thriller; a delusional pinch of misdirection and screenwriting runaround that should've been a bottle rocket to the brain, but instead suffocates in style and a lack of imagination."
A flimsy fantasy retcon&#46;
Early promise for a ripe inspection of brotherly unrest is quickly dismissed by limited actors and a helmer who never seems to know what he's doing.
The movie version of Nights begins with such promise before it drowns in the romance novelist's syrupy sentimentality.
"David Lowery's A Ghost Story is an ambitious tale filled with gorgeous imagery and pieces of an intriguing narrative, but the film is ultimately let down by its lack of substance, which leaves you with a beautiful, yet somewhat forgettable, experience."
Music isn't much more than elementary sentimentality.
No amount of slick style and visual invention can make up for a contrived and unsatisfying wrap-up.
"Combine so many unsteady elements that they eventually blow up in your face, leaving a sticky bubble-gum residue that's hard to wash off."
It's a movie that seems content to wade in the shallow end of jump scares and other cliched tropes rather than actually explore a story that could have been engaged with some depth.
"While no movie that stars Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard could signify nothing, this one doesn't signify a whole lot."
"It's all pretty low-stakes stuff, and director Marc Turtletaub presents it in a subdued manner that often drains the urgency from even the most dramatic moments."
Can't somebody make Friedberg and Seltzer stop?
"Mopey, dopey."
Felix Herngren's adaptation of Jonas Jonasson's best- selling novel is undermined by a fatal lack of charm.
Paul proves that these children of science fiction have bloomed into a rotten bunch indeed.
The movie is rigged for payoffs more linear than the Parthenon in its prime.
"The film fails at creating characters with credible emotional textures, a task easily, and vividly, demonstrated by Pixar time and time again."
It all feels like so much petty sniping against progress.
"After 2-12 hours of sitting through relentless CGI violent visuals and deafening sound effects, I was exhausted."
The contents of my iPod are more demonic than anything you'll see here.
"The acting and violence are appropriately impressive, but a choppy screenplay, a lack of real-world logic and mixed messages render this less of an update and more of a glorified fanfiction."
"A very funny and very entertaining, if not ultimately, very forgettable movie."
Seems like the video-game version of the original film -- with all the substance and intelligence dropped out.
"The pathetic gender politics, so common in dick-flicks like these, seem particularly simplistic and yucky here. Penn never manages the tough-guy shtick and the plot overburdens him with dilemmas. Director Morel can't offer any lights-out action sequences."
"The point of it all? Nothing more than a flash of steel in the darkness, it seems."
Perhaps a better title would have been Oh Brother! Bear.
This is horror at its worst.
"Ferrara's thin idea for a movie - life goes on, even when it's about to stop - would have been a lot better had he given his characters more to do."
"White trash caricature is the film's default mode, which comes across more as cruel and mean-spirited than anything else (Splice Today)"
"Features some good acting - you show them, Beyonce - but too many stories drain the effect of the film."
A comedy as disposable -- and stinky -- as loaded Pampers.
...a shockingly incompetent effort from a once-promising director.
"""Live by Night"" may look first-rate (though Affleck's direction, whether it's action or simply two people, seething, is routine) but it feels second-hand."
And what happened to Morgan Spurlock's inquisitive nature?
"Disappointingly, despite the top-notch cast headlining the film, Transcendence does not quite live up to its potential. The narrative is too clunky and the characters are a tad superficial."
A movie that drips with condescension.
"Macht's weary, fatalistic take on his heroic duties is right out of the Batman mold, while Jackson's Octopus seems little more than The Joker without all the face makeup."
"Amy Ryan has a nice turn as Don's naive assistant, but her humanity is more than this movie can handle."
"Both heavy-handed and ham-fisted, this is a self-important morality tale where you can see everyone's uppance coming long before it arrives."
"Pacing leaves a lot to be desired and the moment-of-attack sequences, full of jagged cuts and a great deal of noise, more closely resemble the view from inside a washing machine."
This King falls distressingly short of the crown.
"At once too literal and too phantasmagorical to make a coherent whole, but for fans of eco-horror it does offer plenty of weird moments, although the makers haven't contrived a satisfying conclusion."
A formulaic Disney comedy.
"Each next turn is so thoroughly telegraphed that it wasn't until the end that it dawned on me I was supposed to be wondering if one of the leads was playing the other and, if so, which one."
"The American is a film in which nothing happens for approximately 110 minutes. For long periods, you could be forgiven for thinking that you had walked into an extended perfume or clothes commercial."
Comedies really don't have to settle for this level of whatever.
"The points earned by its visual identity, promising concept, and talented cast are lost by an aimless script. [Full review in Spanish]"
Even the usually reliable Dennis Quaid flounders as a fellow parent in a film that is at least slickly put together but is ultimately a sheer waste of talent.
"It's reverential rather than revealing, predictably admiring where it needs to be nuanced and challenging."
"The whole thing leaves you feeling confused, especially the dénouement. That is not what good moviemaking is all about."
"An insipid and conventional melodrama, strictly academic in execution. [Full review in Spanish]"
Su argumento es bastante dbil y esta estructurado tan pobremente que no logra empatizar con la audiencia
"When faced with a boring movie during the holiday season, you can only use one quip, so I am going for it. BLAH humbug!"
"For a movie that never stops moving, Dead Men Tell No Tales is astoundingly dull, choked to death by expensive CGI, lumbering set-pieces, and a script seemingly cobbled together even after production was underway."
A long infomercial.
An endurance test filled with commonplace frustrations and woefully lacking in true multicultural insight.
"""While its story must be witnessed and engaged with, this is an unacceptable means through which we must do so."""
"This isn't the story of Barnum's life, but a formulaic rags-to-riches story grafted onto the broad outlines of Barnum's career as a circus entrepreneur."
"Lurches between sappiness and self-consciousness -- resulting in a movie which, for all its charms, fails to convince on either dramatic or whimsical terms."
"Knight and Day woke me up to just how awful some summer entertainments have become. It isn't that the film is harmful, except to moviegoers' wallets and movie lovers' morale, but that it is truly phenomenal for the purity of its incoherence."
"No doubt about it, Alison Eastwood has picked up a thing or two from her old man. Her debut feature is slow, deliberate, assured, and shot with a graceful feel for place -- none of which is enough to overcome the creaky themes."
"A been there, done that drama about a broken soul that is by no means terrible a film, but it certainly is forgettable."
"Jesus, man, Tony Stark died for this? Sad, it really is."
Stewart gives another great performance but the otherwise good film feels a little thin due to the lack of sub-plot.
Suburbicon's flaws are a result of its ambitions.
"Running Scared is about as hard an ""R"" rating as you can get, with buckets of blood, full- frontal nudity and swearing that would peel gum from the sidewalk."
Hough sleepwalks through Cody's worst effort to date as a writer and only supporting turns by the always-game Russell Brand and never-bad Octavia Spencer save the film from being a strong candidate for the worst of the year. It still comes close.
"The more frenzied the action gets, the duller the film becomes."
"In one scene, Terrence Howard kneels in a pair of shoes like Tim Conway in a 'Dorf on Golf' video, licks a lollipop and utters this line: 'I gotta go dookie.' I hope they paid him well."
Green Zone is the rare miss from frequent collaborators Matt Damon and director Paul Greengrass.
The frenzied drama has no clear point of view besides its air of celebrity condescension.
"In many films, you must suspend belief, but this film attempts to meld two worlds -- one of reality and one of absurdity -- and it just doesn't work."
It's not quite right to call W. a wasted opportunity: that would suggest that the idea of a biopic of the sitting president had some value in the first place.
"[Burstyn's] best scenes with a Bee are with Loretta Devine's Sally, whose uproarious bit on 'underboob sweat' is the film's funniest. But these elements are like a life raft on the Titanic."
"For most of the movie, Luhrmann fillets incident into montage, his slice-and-dice approach thwarting any possible momentum; we long for a scene that lasts more than ten seconds. "
I suppose it's a genuine achievement that a movie packed with as much delightful canine (and agreeable human) talent as this one should be so insufferable.
Tackles its Iraq War subject matter with such sledgehammer clumsiness that it risks giving viewers blunt head trauma.
So bad it must be a Badham picture.
"It's big, loud, about half-an-hour to an hour overlong, and devoid of the things that make big, loud action flicks entertaining."
"Bad news: Donald Trump is in Two Weeks Notice, and he's not even the most annoying thing in the movie."
"A diluted interpretation of Aughts torture-porn with a film-student appreciation for Gaspar No's color palette, Rupture is a sci-fi abduction thriller that leaves little to be thrilled about."
the kind of instantly forgettable film that seems to have been designed to play in empty multiplexes in the early weeks of the year before the movies that people actually want to see finally start coming out.
"It's a complex, conflicted movie that is as well intentioned as it is ultimately meaningless."
"John Crowley emails in his directing: ""Get actor A to say his line, then get actor B to say hers."""
"A misguided sequel that seems meandering and carelessly thrown together with no attention paid to its mixed messaging and detrimental alteration in location. ""Rio 2"" takes a property that was already on the mediocre side and cuts it at the knees."
"Inevitably, many viewers will contrast Collateral Beauty with Manchester by the Sea, this season's other grief drama, and Collateral Beauty will crumble in the comparison."
The underwater sequences intended to visualize Talokan are drab and washed-out to the point of distraction&#44; and even a street-level car chase shot at night is near-impossible to track&#44; all the darkness seemingly intended to cover for lackluster CGI&#46;
"With only one member of its love triangle really delivering, this packs less of an emotional punch than it ought. And who'd be a courtier, eh?"
"The film soars early as a fantasy steeped in life and crashes into a drag of a crime drama, one ripped from the movies rather than anyone's idea of small-town Colorado."
One hour and 47 minutes of cheap jump scares and dull grinding of gears.
A Final Destination knock-off.
"A trip to the corner store with this cast of characters would be an endurance test - which, with any luck, is as far as the movie's box office returns will carry it."
"Dee Rees's Joan Didion adaptation The Last Thing He Wanted very nearly works thanks to Anne Hathaway, but the film's narrative shortcomings crater it."
"Elektra's muddled story and formal unsightliness aren't filmmaking tragedies of Greek proportions, just Hollywood's latest casualty of concept over character."
"But as the stakes escalate, Hákonarson seems to lose interest, settling for a cynical resolution that feels more like a shrug than an actual ending."
"It's hard to imagine a more anodyne, low-impact, aimless version of this film."
"Marred by a worthless script, meandering performances and leaden direction. And a worthless script."
"The narrative plays it too safe and straightforward, making for a serviceable but generic effort."
"Zoolander No. 2 is embarrassing, lazy, and aggressively unfunny. The only good news is that at the pace the franchise is moving, we won't get Zoolander 3 until 2030."
The energy of Malek's imitation helps to bind what amounts to a series of gossipy but harmless rock-world anecdotes into something vaguely coherent.
"With the movie's gaping holes in character arcs and important plot discoveries, it feels as if there is an entire reel missing from The Paperboy."
This pastiche comedy is a piecemeal procedure in Hollywood excess.
Jack Frost is so treacly and fake it makes you feel like you're trapped in a winter-wonderland paperweight.
The struggle unfolds in a predictable and nasty way in a film that is technically polished but way too long and tiresome.
"Typical Sandler contrived comedy, with more heart and the likeable Drew Barrymore to help keep the African safari-themed absurdity and crudity to tolerant levels."
"With Massoud himself gradually questioning his unbending convictions, Amiri does not present a concrete or clear stance on the subject, depriving his treatise of the depth and complexity it thoroughly needs."
"Johnson's lube of choice is whimsy, and as the filmmaker pours an endless stream of cutesy behaviors and larger-than-life screenwriting into the stew, Brothers Bloom eventually curdles altogether"
"Except for the five-star chemistry between the pair, Stuber ends up mostly a middling ride."
"Despite a certain amount of production dash and polish and a few silly-funny lines of dialog, Barbarella isn't very much of a film."
"Pearce's debut as a writer-director is not merely a lemon. It's a lemon mélange pie of contemporary action, futuristic 'world-building,' and high and low cultural references."
"A subtle, sporadically powerful portrait of a young woman in turmoil. But unfortunately its fractured, elliptical form--while defensible from a stylistic perspective--ultimately undermines its effectiveness as drama."
Lacks a sense of humor and a notion about the essential silliness of this premise.
"The first Noel Coward play to hit the big screen in more than 40 years, Easy Virtue is a crass, heavy- handed and -- most unfor givably -- largely laugh-free adaptation of The Master's infrequently revived 1924 comic melodrama."
"The word 'comedy' only applies loosely; the laughs are strictly sporadic, and not even Danny DeVito's gruff appeal is enough to overcome the soulless cynicism at the heart of this paint-by-numbers exercise."
"[Norton] seems to resent that in the Fight Club food chain, he's Edward Norton and not Brad Pitt."
"Only people with a serious interest in the recent history of Abercrombie & Fitch, or mall retail in general, should bother with this movie."
The vacuous but well-meaning pic is poorly executed and seems as if it were a TV movie.
"Not even the buoyant, self-deprecating spirit that spills from the band members can mask the fact that Angio never makes the most fundamental case: why there should be a Mekons movie in the first place."
The acting is so pallid that you're never sure the cast members quite get the jokes.
"New World Order essentially offers nothing 'new' on the topic, nor displays any concrete 'order' in structuring its haphazard collage of hit and run gotcha moments."
Directed with a conspicuous lack of inspiration.
"Whereas a single, stinging one-liner would have sufficed Jacques Tourneur or Fritz Lang, Frank Miller's overcompensating flood of pulpy dialogue only renders his characters flat and sans empathy."
It's possibly the director's worst film to date. Let's hope it's just a blip.
"The sound design in Surge submerges us in a fractured mind, but that doesn't save the film from feeling like Ben Whishaw's discarded Joker audition tape."
"Like the earlier Divergent films, Allegiant is studded with enticing science-fiction ideas, but it keeps such a poker-straight face while presenting them, you often can't help but crack up."
"The script is stupid and debasing, subjecting the tycoon to numerous cat-piss and emasculation jokes after he turns into ""Mister Fuzzypants."""
...director Todd Phillips wrongly seems to think he can solve any problem with more mayhem. How about better jokes instead?
"No matter how many times you scour afterward, the filmy scum left by Hot Tub Time Machine 2 lingers like greasy dark ring around the brain."
"The Nightingale remains a film of grand intent and ambition, but it just does not soar."
"There's nothing wrong with a survival-against-all-odds story that aims for the heart instead of the head, but this one keeps blasting indiscriminately away at the heart, destroying all the other vital organs along the way."
"The screenplay has social-commentary ambitions, but the directors can't shake the stench of bargain-bin imitation that clings to the whole thing."
[A] hilariously absurd slice of American cheese...
There are forty minutes of A+ movie here. Then the story you came to see is tossed in the garbage can and replaced with a different one.
...'forgettable' is one of the best things one could call this film.
"It's possible the movie seemed to Lohan and/or her handlers a means to transition from her Disney movies into ""adult"" fare. It's also possible that no one read a script."
The Empire strikes out with a lot of life lessons we already know and stuff we've all seen before.
"Preposterous, and a bit low-budget, but the story is socked over with earnest energy."
"First, you try to understand what the hell is going on. Then you slowly realize that you will never understand what is going on. And, last, you wind up with the distinct impression that, if there was anything to understand, it wasn't worth the sweat."
"This lightness finally overshadows the story's elegiac potential and leaves the toll of Cassidy's exile largely untapped, and even Shepard's magnetism can't lift Blackthorn above the status of cinematic lark."
"While sporadically funny, the sophomoric My Name Is Bruce is no Bubba Ho-Tep."
"Walking Tall, at the very least, can turn in its claim ticket as the silliest movie of the new year."
"Plenty of twisty scripting makes the queasy damage seem conceptually neat and tidy, as if that's a good idea, but what we need here is a little more meat."
How do you satirize something that's already a joke?
If only the filmmakers had put as much creative energy into the character of Hal Jordan as they did into his lovingly rendered CGI-enhanced suit
"[VIDEO] It's doubtful that even Roman Polanski could have made ""The Rite"" a good horror film, but he would have at least made it into a competent one."
"Jennifer Lopez plays a lesbian in Gigli, and Ben Affleck plays a heterosexual man, which means they have one thing in common: Both of them are in a crummy movie."
It's a missed opportunity...
"Requires that Terry, Erin and other villains act increasingly stupid, making dumb moves that would ruin them in church bingo."
Don't subject yourself to this crap ...
A scarily stupid mix of Flashdance superficiality and small-town-girl-conquers-the-music-biz cliches.
Promising premise devolves into a by-the-numbers espionage thriller.
"Diane Keaton and Brendan Gleeson aren't an obvious match; despite their combined lovability, this slender romcom doesn't prove otherwise."
"...a fairly routine sci-fi thriller where most of the scenes tend to work as single units, but don't connect together nearly as well as they should..."
the script and Martha Coolidge direction are so play-it-safe formulaic that the film lacks fairy-tale luster. It's as predictable as an Elvis movie-without the music.
50 First Dates is working awfully hard to be romantic and not hard enough to be a comedy.
"For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - ""The Age of Adaline"" doesn't have a lot of wisdom."
"The Unholy teases us with a clever and eerie tale about the twisting of faith, but it gradually and finally becomes little more than a generic horror show."
It's just a generic teen product lacking the attitude that the title suggests. [Full Review in Spanish]
Having the means to do something doesn't always mean it should be done.
"big-budget schlock too content to rely on cheap theatrics to tap into anything more substantive, even if its reportedly extensive re-shoots resulted in a third act that is considerably more engaging than the previous two."
What made anyone believe this was a movie worth making or that there would be an audience for it?
the beginning of the end for Eddie Murphy
Megan progresses into an increasingly underwhelming midsection and second half&#46;&#46;&#46;
"The more I write about this film, the more ridiculous it sounds."
"Though it is quite possible that the neutered feel of Luhrmann's Gatsby is entirely due to studio meddling, the finished product isn't enjoyable, either as campy fun or a serious attempt at dismantling the American dream."
"May not do much for its director's resume, but it certainly must have filled out his passport."
You should read what happens in the book. It would make a helluva movie.
"Irritating characters, little semblance of a plot, weak gags, and sub-par performances ... result in a film that doesn't even have enough going on to interest a five-year-old."
"It lives in that kinda-sorta, okay-not-great, this-worked-that-didn't in-between for which words like ""better"" and ""worse"" fall woefully short."
"Unfortunately, while Hitman: Agent 47 may offer a passable diversion for the action fans among us, for everyone else it's best avoided."
"Feels like an elementary school recess that's gone on too long, the merrymaking strained and the participants looking tired even when they're in full comic dudgeon."
The Beach is quite easily the most colorful bad movie of the year...
Man on a Ledge flirts with B-movie greatness but comes up short thanks to the far-fetched plot device used to power a clunky hybrid of heist flick/Hitchcockian wrong-man thriller.
Very long and doesn't work. [Full review in Spanish]
"It is perhaps Spirit's greatest achievement that the horses upstage the human actors, but it's also its greatest weakness. The human characters have no depth or personality, but are rather completely forgettable, stiff stereotypes."
"A near-miss, but a miss all the same."
"Overall, the film itself is a sleep-inducing bore."
"A repulsive movie, marred by grotesquely hammy acting and inscrutable presentation by Brian De Palma."
Doesn't quite justify itself despite some strong performances.
Just when we think we've come to terms with its brand of poorly-plotted silliness it ups the ante once more.
3000 Miles To Graceland would have worked if even one main character were attractive as a human being.

"Gods of Egypt is a dull, meandering, plastic mess of pre-2002 CGI and performances as flat as the green screens behind them."
"...the human subjects of Dana Brown's documentary don't have much to say. Everyone recites the same ""Surfing's great"" mantra."
Stylish but shallow horror
The Coen Bros. spin their wheels by calling so much attention to every stab at humor.
Doesn't evince a firm enough grasp on the rhythms of lower-middle-class life in Rust Belt Pennsylvania to compensate for the over-dependence on crisis melodrama in Brad Inglesby's script.
"The ""joke"" soon wears thin, however, and the film, with few actual ideas to express, resorts to slapdash plotting and dead-end gore."
Well below de line of recent animated features. A generic adventure family film with weak visuals and story. [Full review in Spanish]
"It's a film about style that has none, a film about tough guys that has no punch, a cocktail without the booze."
"This film is sincere, earnest and irritating."
"Once again, mixing tragedy and comedy is not something that everyone knows how to do. Scott has plenty of talent not to fall for fashion. And yet he does. [Full Review in Spanish]"

A passably entertaining adventure best suited to 10-year-old boys.
The Will Ferrell Comedy Train might be out of steam.
"A much darker, French version of He Said, She Said with several pinches of Fatal Attraction caught between its aspirations and execution."

"The film tracks the history of the country, but viewers may feel the documentarian inserts herself too much into the story."
"Unfortunately, despite Rosewater's earnest and intelligent approach, it remains a shallow treatment of a topic that deserves much more."
Watching On_Line is a dispiriting experience that leaves you with a nagging 'Is that all there is?' feeling about sex in general.
"This ""Midsummer"" is a chore."
"High school sucks, especially when the bullies can toss you from wall to wall or throw fireballs."
"I'm not even really sure where it gets lost, but it ends up going nowhere."
tired instead of touching
"Scenes run on and on, begging to be trimmed so that this cinematic vessel can become one tight ship."
There are bits of brilliance here as in all Coen Brothers movies. Just not enough of them.
"Each development is unadorned and plain. This, you could get from a plot summary."
"Despite its wild premise - Chris Pratt goes to the future to fight aliens! - and considerable talent, The Tomorrow War is mostly just bloated blockbuster business as usual."
"Everything was fine, until the plot kicked in, which was only ten minutes into the movie..."
Glaring in its absurdity is cowing to presentism by picturing innumerable Africans as prominent members of society&#44; even members of Royalty and members of bi-racial marriages&#46; In 1290 England&#63; That needs to be exposed and rejected in defense of honesty&#46;
Truth in advertising 'Vampires suck' and so does this movie
"Silk is a languid, too languid, story of romantic regrets, mostly ours, because romance is expected to carry the film without explaining it."
Thanks but no thanks.
"When the [ending] surprises finally come, the letdown in the audience is palpable, as the twists are small and relatively inconsequential."
"Parts of this movie should appeal to Venom fans, but it's difficult to argue this as a solid feature. Unless you're dying to see this, skip it until its available to stream."
"Scorsese's regular team, including production designer Dante Ferretti, turns Moroccan locations into a splendid backdrop for the Dalai Lama's life. It's what happens in front of that backdrop which may cause you do drop back in your seat and grab a nap."
"Monotony soon sinks in thanks to side-tracking flashbacks, trite dialogue and snigger-inducing seriousness."
"We haven't even mentioned the hockey puck torture scene, or the relentless ricochetting camerawork, or the multiple last minute switcheroos -- it's got more endings than Lord Of The Rings."
"The equivalent of watching a game of Risk, with all the emotional involvement such an activity would hold."
"The jokes are predominantly tired, unimaginative and poorly delivered."
A witless examination of a woman who is only ever seen in superficial details.
Develops in a very unsatisfactory way. [Full review in Spanish]
"Mal actuada, mal editada, mal musicalizada y peor dirigida"
"The acrobatic repetition bores you breathless. Spare Benjamin Walker, who deserves to go on to better things. But the movie deserves a stake through the heart."
"Heartbreaker's best ideas come courtesy of There's Something About Mary, while its worst are ripped straight from the rom-com boilerplate."
I come here not to bury Derek Zoolander - only to eugoogalise him.
"The Gentlemen is at times nauseatingly overwritten and pleased with itself, which is rather infuriating considering that it's a decent little potboiler when it isn't trying so hard."
"Perhaps only Visconti, who seems obsessed with the gloomy side of decadence, could have made Ludwig II of Bavaria seem boring."
Do Revenge is a mildly funny dark comedy that provides characters who are terrible and places them in situations that should have created laughs&#46;
Disjointed and predictable.
"Perhaps Iron Sky can be best appreciated as an experiment in filmmaking, but as a film to watch for entertainment value it fails almost completely."
"The young ""Four"" cast appears to have been plucked from an Abercrombie & Fitch catalogue - which isn't an issue until you realize that the characters they're playing are about as thin as the pages in that Gen-Y fashion Bible."
"There's nothing in Prisoners of the Ghostland that marks the film out as memorable or, worse, original. It's a mess, and not a particularly fun one at that."
"As a superficial treatment of this important subject, it has its moments."
"This is the crucial proposition The Proposition misses: To make us truly despair about the face of violence, it must be firmly attached to someone we know, and not merely blown off someone we don't."
"It all adds up to not much, but it is still a serviceable example of the way big-budget, potential blockbuster movies are currently required to be made."
Ambitious but pretentious.
It's hard not to watch the somber Jane without thinking that this is one of those cases where the making-of could be better - and definitely more fun - than the final product.
"The ugly truth of The Ugly Truth is that it is, yet again, another in a long line of recent Hollywood romantic comedies that for some reason hates women."
"in a lackadaisical sequel no one asked for except perhaps his creditors, Bruce Willis seems unmotivated to smile at all, much less offer a series of emotions that constitute a believable or compelling performance."
It&#8217;s the serious tone and repetitiveness that unmoors a lot of what works about 65&#46; 
It was hilariously bad.
I don't know when I've seen a movie so completely smug in its belief that its audience is on a par with Pavlov's dogs.
"Except for a few nice, honest moments that manage to sneak in, watching Nanny McPhee is like being beaten over the head with a toy mallet: harmless, yet awfully irritating."
"Gibney offers no conclusion but the familiar paradox: great products, unpleasant person."
Only the most masochistic connoisseurs of the truly awful need check it out.
"It would be easy to say that the final minutes of this mixed-up thriller make everything before it meaningless, but that would indicate the odd conclusion has meaning, too."
"Sherry may represent a generation detached from its moorings, but as an individual, she's no more than the sum of her pathologies."
[The] floppiest of the floppy-haired British romantic comedies... Toothless and bland...
"If Hollywood decides to do a remake of Grumpy Old Men in about 10 years, let me present you with the ideal candidate to fill one of the lead roles: Harrison Ford."
"More skin is shown in Spread than in most Hollywood movies. But despite twitches of insight into its characters and their world, Spread refuses go more than skin deep."
"Chilling, ominous mood balances well with comic relief, at least at first. After that, the two disparate elements clash in a manner difficult to reconcile, the film loses focus on underdeveloped threads, and it meanders to a shrug of an ending."
The Bye Bye Man is an uneven mixture of effective scares and ineffective filler.
"High concept still fails without writers filling in the blank spots, and 'Jack Black in wrestling tights' is funny for about as long as the trailer you've already seen."
"If you've seen Independence Day, then you've seen War of the Worlds."
"[W]here the original Tunes were subversive, *Back in Action* is smarmy; instead of lobbing zingers, it's lobbing spitballs. And it's all anvil, no anticipation."
"It's a promising start for director Tze Chun, but despite the film's charms, the story doesn't get interesting enough early enough."
"The Rising Sun flip-side of Flags of Our Fathers, Letters deserves a salute for its profiles in Japanese courage. P.S. It's still stamped with Eastwood's flogging of the moral high ground."
"Too good to abandon, but not some ""lost classic"" either."
The only thing scary about Dark Water is the fact the movie never seems to end.
"The word 'amandla' means power, and the music undeniably has that, but it lacks the archival footage to put the music in context."
Nowhere near as fun as that premise probably sounds.
"It is hard to hate cute little talking chipmunks who love waffles, so maybe you can say I was annoyed."
The truth remains that Lagerfeld's expertly cultured air of mystique is one of his unique selling points and he's unlikely to give up any family secrets to anyone with the clunking interview technique of Marconi.
"Maria Bello's skill and onscreen presence speak volumes about the mother's thoughts and feelings, even when the script leaves her high and dry."
Fashion biopic is OK for teens; more style than substance.
"A respectful treatise on one of the great international sports figures. But unless you're a fan tuned to the technical and historical sides of racing, A Life of Speed is kind of a drag."
There's an undercurrent of anxiety navigating the calm waters...
The artwork has the familiar saucer-eyed look of Japanese anime but with a scuffed angularity that's a long way from Hayao Miyazaki's sublime magic.
"Jokes do arrive thick and fast but with an emphasis on the former, constantly lowering the tone with gags that are at best uncomfortable and at worst downright inappropriate."

The Wachowskis have collected their last blank check from The Warner Brothers

"Hancock and Fusco want their protagonists to be the good guys so badly that they have rigged the game, creating a world were everything they do becomes right by virtue of having been done by them."
Fundamentally Ramis plays it way too safe with the religious material. Think less Life Of Brian than a teacher trying to jolly up the parables at Hebrew school - it still beats being smited by a plague of frogs.
It takes brains to be this idiotic.
"... an angry, bitter and abhorrent display of masochism masquerading around as a legitimate horror film."
"Scene after ponderous scene is presented in a nausea-inspiring conflagration of pointless close-ups, out-of-focus expositions and handheld ""wobble"" shots"
It&apos;s fine if &#8220;Champions&#8221; wants to double-dribble across sports-movie tropes&#46; But it&#8217;s far too easy to call foul on a story that can feel as reductive off the court as it is empowering on it&#46;
Isn't this just one big conspiracy by the rich old guys who run Hollywood (and the world) to scare sexy women like Jennifer Lopez away from chasing after young hot dudes?
"It's campy, bad, and fun. Unfortunately, ""bad"" isn't always good."
Another elevator pitch that [Shyamalan] never develops into a compelling story.
The movie's central story is too slight and predictable to justify all the embroidery Sayles adds around the edges.
A very aptly named movie.
The material is just too familiar and we are given know reason to care if Modigliani lives or dies.
Out Of The Dark employs the usual scare tactics of creepy children and spooky legends.
"By seeing this kind of story in the context of ultimately triumphalist entertainment, we risk seeing every tragic event, every terrorist activity, as just more fodder for big-screen storytelling, rather than as part of a larger picture."
A $20 million paycheck for this?
"As much a bore as its predecessor, the ""Yellow"" movie."
"The first 20 minutes are gripping, but once we flash forward, a soporific pattern sets in."
"The movie's biggest sin lies not in where it chooses to cast blame, but in its bungled attempt at manufacturing what I suppose you'd have to call an epiphany of excess."
A visual treat but a less-than-tantalizing mystery.
The problem with They Came Together is that what it settles on as the parody-able thing about romantic comedy is how generic it can feel.
"The result is a polished and satisfying film, yet one that conspicuously feels even more like a consumer product than most Disney revivals of its animated classics."
The final act is so wildly pretentious that it destroys any speck of humanity that the skeleton - buried under layers of charred flesh - is built to express...
"Ready Player One is a pageant of now-dated pop culture references, an elaborate feat of CGI and copyright clearance, with images from games and movies speeding past, to the tune of Van Halen and A-Ha."
"On the evidence of Pixar's latest cartoon, 'Monsters University,' the studio's brain trust is beginning to run thin in the ideas department."
"Is it possible for a film to be entirely composed of filler? Pick up those tickets to your local ballet show instead, and dodge this bullet of mediocrity while funding the (actual) arts."
There are bags of atmosphere and style in A Cure For Wellness but not much of a story.
"... occupies a safe middle ground between exposé and unrequited romance.... the opposite of an Oliver Stone smear job: a careful, rigorously fair-mined depiction of a man who deserved less and, in a bizarre way, more."
"A dreary, uninspired tale."
"The Farewell Party leaves no doubt as to where it stands on the right to die with dignity when facing terminal illness, but it's so clumsily made that it serves only to exasperate."
"Shhh. Hear that sound? That's Silencio, an overambitious sci-fi melodrama written, produced and directed by Lorena Villarreal, landing with a gigantic thud."
"Even though this oddball ensemble boasts intelligent ideas and a smorgasbord of against-type performances from A-list names, “Amsterdam” amounts to less than the sum of its parts."
"Closer to the culprit to pinpoint first-time screenwriter Stel Pavlou, who writes in English like I write in Tagalong. I don't, is what I'm saying."
"While there are some beautifully shot, subtle moments in the film that encapsulate the desperation and degradation of the characters, the director ends up alienating his audience in an attempt to display the alienation of his characters."
"Sadly, the ending suggests a part three. Talk about beating an undead horse."
"Despite its title, it's too soft and squishy for comfort, and while it can't be counted a strike-out on the cinematic scoreboard, it's at best a weak single."
A prime example of risk-free film-making.
"SON OF RAMBOW is full of ideas and imagination, but I think Jennings buries himself with all of his ambition."
"Despite some glorious passages, Alice and Martin is play-act passion."
It takes some effort to neutralize the charm of a modestly charismatic Robert De Niro performance. But Everybody's Fine does a stupendous job.
"[Farrel], who seems to be trying to salvage his dignity, . . .gets points for keeping a straight face as Pacino constantly beetles in on him to deliver his lines."
"Action hero may not be what [Gabrielle] Union does best, but her versatility stands her in good enough stead; here's hoping this potboiler makes enough money to bring her vehicles more worthy of her."
Is there such a thing as a low-octane thriller?
"All the King's Men is the noblest kind of film failure -- high-minded, literary, cautionary, well-cast and pretty well-acted."
"Dupieux's movie is all script twists, lacking both the nave wonder of the films to which he pays homage and the inventive sophistication of grand Surrealist fantasy."
"The good news: it is easily a step up from the worthless, dirge-worthy likes of Saw IV and Saw V. The not-so-good news, then, is that the film is still unnecessary and convoluted, the series having long since run out of steam and freshness."
Warmly affectionate yet curiously hollow.
"Please, shoot me now."
"A gory, dreary dud of a potboiler -- and a brazen, hackish ripoff of 'Psycho'."
"Tonally adolescent, the film is enraptured with the emo-ness and ecstasy of love...Love may be all you need, but, sheesh, give it a rest for a second."
The film struggles constantly just to maintain mediocrity.
"Durkin's latest tale keeps do-si-do-ing around a real plot with real characters, but ""The Nest,"" like ""Mary Marcy May Marlene,"" is exhausting and a little embarrassing."
"The FP has a one-note joke of a conceit, and when that runs out, it has few actual jokes to fill the humorless void."
"For a movie that insists on the truth of humanity's mutual dependency, Babel feels disconnected from anything but its own artistic determinism."
With an intriguing premise and some fine camerawork Old starts off strong but the dubious script and narrative meandering weigh it down.
"""It's as lack of nuance and objectivity which turns a potentially complex film into a simple, mostly one noted message movie."""
"Nothing but a transparent attempt to keep the brand name alive and the marketing spigot open, and it really does not attempt to go above that horribly mediocre bar."

This ludicrously melodramatic adaptation of The Wild Duck makes mincemeat out of Ibsen's play.
Mr Hall's halfway house between screen and stage looks almost as uncomfortable a perch as the curious grave-like earthwork in which Judy Dench's Titania has her sleeping-quarters.
"Scene after rambling scene, everyone in front of the camera spells out the script's messaging with verbose, bold-faced statements that do nothing to improve the overall quality of the cast's efforts. Overacting runs rampant."
"Co-directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel, whose visual schemes lent a hypnotic aura to their previous collaborations ... don't find the right balance of story and image this time."
Besson's futuristic fable is flawed by a messy narrative which strains to incorporate far too many grotesque and eccentric characters.
"Dynamic but obsessively remote from reality, Out of Time is like a drive-in movie for a car junkyard. The motor races, but the tires are flat, while the characters are given sizzle by their cell phones."

Greenberg would be a heckuva movie if we could just get Greenberg out of there.

&#8230;music is the one thing this sequel gets right&#8230;

"Director Michael Scott wastes little time before starting to drop sinister hints, but they're so unsubtle that they undermine the script's attempts to create a shadowy noir atmosphere."
"RR and QT do an excellent job of simulating the content of grindhouse offerings, but they don't simulate the experience or the giddy kick."
Lasse Hallstrom never met a case of advanced emotional constipation he couldn't unplug in two psychobabbly hours or less.
While the blending of genres has become a tentpole for modern superhero movies&#44; Love and Thunder is a vampire&#44; sucking all the life from each genre it emulates&#46;

"Not quite a parody but broader than an homage, The Lone Ranger fights itself at every turn."
"To Rome With Love is carelessly written, uneven in quality, and nowhere near as charming as Midnight In Paris; but its good points place it in the lower-middle range of Allen's output."
"This is the worst sort of horror film, one that cloaks its shameless pulls at the heartstrings in overemphatic sound design, hyped-up visuals, and a tear-streaked lead performance by Belen Rueda."
"Jordan takes his fey protagonist the most seriously of all, picturing him as just about the most perfect and true creature in the universe."
"Meant to be a wild, witty and playful comedy-actioner, Killers disappoints on both counts, unfolding as a series of ideas and cliches borrowed from pictures like To Catch a Thief, True Lies, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and others."
It's almost as if the creators couldn't be bothered to develop the scenario beyond a slapdash first draft.
"Bottom line: should you watch Triple 9? No! Is it a slick thriller? Yes, but only in its looks."
"The film's 114-minute running time is hardly outrageous for a story of this type, but it feels a whole lot longer than that."
The Other Woman is as insightful about infidelity as Kim Kardashian would be about nuclear physics. What a detestable piece of crud this picture is.
"Like many movies with morals at the end, however, it has its slasher and eats him, too."
"It treats arms dealing as a heady adventure, ignores its consequences, and Hill and Teller manage to make their characters even more dislikeable than they were intended to be."
"Nina has been so thoroughly misconceived, on virtually every level, that the only less interesting portrait imaginable would be one that takes place entirely when Nina Simone was in utero."
"Fully-stocked, well-oiled and soulless, You've Got Mail sure feels like a franchise operation -- all that's missing is a greeter and a discount card."
"Watching a single athlete for the duration of a game is an interesting concept, but Zidane is better in theory than in execution."
There&#8217;s a reason this 1985 work hasn&#8217;t been filmed before now&#46; And throwing &#36;140 million and Noah Baumbach&#46;&#46;&#46;at it explains why&#46;&#10;&#10;
The Runaways does nothing to distinguish itself from previous depictions of the lives and excesses of our most beloved and most tragic rock and pop icons.
It's a great big snore.

"Just a bad low-budget 3D B-movie creature sci-fi adventure film, but (oy vez) with deadly spiders."
These themes have been handled with more depth on I Love Lucy and The Brady Bunch.
'The Ring Two' joins the vast majority of film follow-ups that don't measure up to the original.
So generic that it sometimes approaches the self-parody of a Naked Gun movie!
The casting is such a mystery that you could be forgiven for thinking the whole process was done by small ads in an LA trade paper.
"You can't spell ""law force"" without ""orc."" And you can't spell ""David Ayer's twelfth cop movie??"" without ""Why develop? Is it a dare?"""
"The flitting glimpses of interesting moments and grand rooms don't shape into much of a narrative here, perhaps because the people featured also seem detached from a greater purpose."
At 70-odd minutes it's a short film but not engrossing enough to make time fly.
"'Standing Up, Falling Down' falters by presenting too many awkward scenes that don't seem real. But Billy Crystal fans should enjoy his splendid performance as an alcoholic estranged from his angry son."
"Although Diallo makes some trenchant observations about diversity-equity-inclusion initiatives and cultural appropriation, she jams too many plot beats, characters and polemical points into the narrative for all of them to pay off satisfactorily."

"As aggressively unpleasant as the movie often is to watch, the quality of Brotherhood's badness throws the viewer clear, marking it as spectacle -- one notch below ordeal"

"Transformers: Age of Extinction is simply more of the same mindless action, flat characters, and utter boredom that we've come to expect from these bloated mechanical sequels."
"Amid all this flexing of moviemaking muscle, there's possible evidence of uncertainty as well."
"It isn't as nutty as it could have been, and it certainly isn't as nutty as its description suggests."
The effect is like looking at a portrait of passion instead of a portrait of people feeling passionate. The humanity feels one step removed.
Parental Content Review
"We've known this franchise bleeds since the first Alien v. Predator, but Black has proven that we can kill it."
Throughout the movie you&#8217;ll find huge gaps in logic&#44; glaring plot holes&#44; and numerous moments where all you can do is bury your face in your hands&#46;

"As flippant vaudeville-style comedies go, Cote d'Azur is rather weak."
"""I don't have a soul,"" Berg laments as a Brancusi sculpture is packed away. ""These objects don't have a soul."" Neither does this movie."

"Deceptive, disgraceful and deplorable..."
The bottom line is that Byrne and company offer us nothing more than another patronizing view of small-town America.
Scott Cooper&#44; while still adept at directing performance&#44; remains shamefully unable to mold his characters into something resembling a story&#44; leaving too many themes and ideas on the table for his movie to work&#46;
"All told, the film has plenty of enjoyable moments, but it's just not the deep experience the filmmakers want you to believe it is."
"There's some powerful material in The Barefoot Artist, but we're presented with only a cursory and unsatisfactory glimpse of it."
"King Arthur: Legend of the Sword often felt like two movies blended together to create an unappetizing, diet shake."

"For a movie that is based on a true story, We Were Soldiers has a lot of war movie cliches."
"Kaufman's other works at least weaved a thread of hope within all their bends; here, the lack of it is glaring and sinks the viewer's spirit along with the film itself."
Ten years ago it was cool to be s-s-s-mokin'. This is the punishment for enjoying that.

"It falls on the velvety-voiced Strong himself, much like his character, to salvage the mission and plow through the overly philosophical dialogue."
Dull-witted caper.

A nostalgic thirst trap with no reverence for the pop culture moments it deploys haphazardly.
"Structured a little like a hypothetical 1963 Twitter timeline, narrowed by the hashtag #JFKRIP: none of the participants have much to say about the man or his absence, but they're appropriately sad about it."
"Fifty Shades Freed is as sexy as a pie fight, and just as funny."
Just Friends is sweet and mostly pleasant to pass the time with...but there's little justification to enter into a serious engagement with it.
"In a morally confused age, a take-no-prisoner, seemingly heartless predator like Tommy Lee Jones' Gerard could easily be elected to high political office."
"Overall, All the Money in the World is a mediocre artistic effort. It displays Scott's propensity for unnecessary brutality..."
"The comedy is pleasant for a while, and it's a totally harmless movie for kids, but it runs mostly on a high-octane mix of slapstick comedy and special effects -- with little for discriminating moviegoers to enjoy."
"The themes of redemption and forgiveness are both timely and timeless, but the connecting narrative proves a tad episodic, and the erosion of ill feelings and grudging respect, however admirable, doesn't feel entirely earned."
"Not so much thought out as strung together -- colorful incident upon colorful incident, but without logic, gathering suspense or any attempt to establish emotional connections between audience and actors."
"The movie strains far too hard to make what Rachel and Dex have done all right, as if their guilty anguish - and the movie's saccharine score - frees us to root for them."
Vice takes the basic premise from 1973's Westworld and morphs it into an incoherent slog.
"The Movie has the same tone and feel as the cable-TV show and should thrill little girls everywhere. Parents should do OK, too."
"Jupiter Ascending feels like some sweatshop-factory assembly of tidbits vaguely recalled from the last 40 years of fantasy, adventure, and sci-fi movies, and hoarded into a forcible orgy of mostly joyless cosplay."
"It's a shame the story in ""First Man,"" which on paper should be effective, is overshadowed by the film's colder aspects."
What you get here is a movie where you can always tell who the wealthy family is because they're the ones whose hair always looks well-shampooed and treated with conditioner.
"It's disposable, watchable and forgettable filmmaking for would-be easy millionaires."
Shall We Dance? never seems to rise above its syrupy premise and ballroom antics.
It's simply incapable of overcoming its leading man's leaden performance.
"Though anchored by strong performances, The Upside stumbles along thanks to a bumbling script that's devoid of any originality."
This movie is definitely for young kids--anyone over the age of 8 will be insulted by how predictable it is.
A misguided runaway trainbound detective story.
Wants to be dystopian sci-fi with postmodern ethics about body autonomy in the face of evolution&#44; wanting to draw that line between what is and isn&#8217;t human &#46;&#46;&#46; It&#8217;s a jumbled mess of student film&#44; self-righteous prognostication&#44; and closed head injury&#46;
"By the end of the movie, Ava comes across less like a feature film and more like a weak pilot for a show that never got picked up to series."
"Suffers from a schematic, overdetermined rigidity, as if screenwriter Ken Hixon had plotted the scenario on graph paper before setting it down in type."
Overlong&#44; maudlin&#44; overstuffed and contrived despite a moving performance by the always-reliable Florence Pugh&#46;&#10;
"No terror or suspense occupies this tired, gloomy vacuum, not to mention wit or humor."
Wonderland feels predictable.

Its fundamental stumbling block [is] ... a story that splits at the seams with plot holes and bloat.
A formulaic hodge-podge that trades on a certain demographic's affection for the bogeymen of their formative years.
Little more than stock characters acting out a generic drama of sin and redemption against a lascivious backdrop that is far more interesting than the story it serves.
Rosaline&apos;s shows its strengths when it focuses on the parallel story of Rosaline and Dario&#44; but when the narrative crosses paths directly with Shakespeare&#8217;s story&#44; Rosaline starts to fall apart&#46;
"A lame love triangle, suffragist speechifying and a wee bit of coy tittering regarding ladies' private parts."
More like Coyote Awful.
"The only thing worth watching in this film is Linc's 1973 Lincoln Continental, a car today that would be hard pressed to fit into any garage in The Woodlands. It's a reminder of why we had an energy crisis back in the 70's."
"Pity about Teen Spirit, since it opens so well."
"The Lorax is so big, flashy and redundant that it courts precisely the kind of blind consumerism it's supposed to be condemning. It doesn't trust kids to sit still and pay attention for even a minute."
"The climactic battle is long, repetitious and boring, while the film's anti-violence message is crassly expressed."
It has all the depth of a 105-minute Jay Leno routine on growing old.
"As modern-day re-stagings of Bible stories go, this is oddly less funny than The Reaping. Next time, for real laughs, do the story of Job."
"[T]his is a movie that's mostly about attitude -- ultimately hollow, while being apathetic about everything it shows and anything it could be saying."
A film that is often as insipid as one of Nicholas Sparks's commercial melodramas.
"Late Night's issues aren't just old jokes, it's old scenarios."
It's not just the sound of crickets you hear watching this movie. It's the sound of dead crickets.
A comedic train wreck that could very well make Carvey the next Joe Piscopo.
Human Capital works hard to keep things ticking evenly in each chapter but doesn't quite manage it.
"BJ McDonnell, too hesitant to stray from the beaten path set by Green's previous films, lacks the looser, more whimsical hand that would have allowed Hatchet III to transcend its thoughtlessly imitative state."
The Millers script -- it took four writers to cobble together something that seems so slight -- hits too many obvious notes between the moments when Aniston can strut her stuff.
Stop me if you've heard this one before...
Where Lucille Ball and Cuban bandleader Desi Arnaz first met.
None of the actors is really any good -- though some have been impressive elsewhere -- but it would be unjust to single them out for failing to rise above the material; what would be remarkable is if anyone could.
"""Kate"" is like ""Crank"" minus the hyper-caffeinated jolt of outlandish nonsense."
"Slick direction and meaty performances may be enough for some viewers, but this boxing drama's complete lack of originality keeps it from being something memorable."
"What sucks more than vampires? Lame, lazy movie parodies aimed at attention-deficient tweens."
In the end Richard Richard Burton's performance ceases to rely on the -profession of acting; it becomes entirely dependent on the exercise of violence.
"Adam is burdened with its predictability, as an archetypal redemption tale told countless times before."
"Naive and amateurish in both the negative and positive sense of these terms, Crossroads provides a disappointing showcase for pop icon and youth symbol Britney Spears, who pretends to be the new-retro Sandra Dee."
"Beautiful to look at, Last Days in the Desert still feels nearly as empty as the land Jesus is traversing."
So one-sided that it nearly validates what the Right says about Hollywood's liberal crusaders.
"A daft and directionless thriller from Steven Spielberg, cynically hijacking Israeli-Palestinian tensions to fuel the engine of an over-heated action vehicle."
"Some things, however, never go out of fashion: like sympathetic characters and coherent storytelling. Alice Through the Looking Glass has neither."
[The Captive] is undone by one too many ill-timed flashbacks and some garish melodrama which reduces the human element.
This handsome movie is an oddly well-behaved one to come from the preternaturally energetic Scorsese.
Why Him? Why me?
Plays it very safe and sticks to a tried-and-true children's movie formula.
If only the story that surrounds this watchable heroine were as well-stacked.
"""The Hunter"" loses its way."
"People have told me they really liked it, so go for the score and sets, stay for when it finally grabs you: be prepared for an uphill climb to the intended transcendence."
"The true test of its efficacy will be how much it motivates viewers after the credits roll. It's an admirable aim, but the project itself feels disposable."
What bothers me about this film is that it rambles a bit and it seems to me inappropriate to be interviewing a 7-year-old saying goodbye to his father... It feels intrusive to me.
"okay, but more silver than gold this time out."
"Ultimately registers as old-fashioned and artificial, like a WWII propaganda movie trying to drum up sales for war bonds."
It begins in a muddle and ends in confusion.
"Taking pages from a well-worn playbook, this hokey football drama lacks subtlety and surprise."
"The repugnant fog of entitlement and inflated hubris that shrouds the film isn't just palpable, it's positively suffocating."
"An unwieldy mash-up of a 1940s-style cliffhanger serial and 'The Breakfast Club' [that] boasts, however, a game cast that gives the material more than it's worth."
The story and set-up feel conceptually flawed from the get-go. This was never going to end well.
"It's a mix of a pathetic, soft-core potboiler and a musical extravaganza of yore that leaves a sour taste at its conclusion."
Shattered crashes from beginning to end.  [Full review in Spanish] 
"Lots of eye candy, but where's the story?"
An honorable attempt to portray the family dynamic of two men who had a powerful impact on the development of golf as a sport of the common man...but ultimately the staid reverence with which it treats their story undermines its dramatic impact.
One of the most vapid and unentertaining stories I've had the displeasure of seeing this year.
"The only reason to watch The Kindergarten Teacher is Ms. Gyllenhaal's performance, whose quality makes us resist until it's possible."
"Suffers from too many of the genre's cliches, ultimately proving to be nothing more than the same slasher retread we've seen since Carpenter's first film arrived in theaters 40 years ago."
"Directors are always digging around in their psyches for material - David Lynch, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Lars von Trier ... Refn's anxiety seems out to top theirs. But there's no joy or folly or transcendence. It's a one-dimensional video game of death."
A rock-doc less vibrant than most.
"While Nick comes to appreciate women in all their complexity and depth, the movie is only interested in them as props and tools to aid in his eventual enlightenment."
"""Rough Night"" should have been a hilarity-filled, albeit derivative, free-for-all. Instead, the undernourished yet excessively clunky script meanders more than zings."
"Renner's Aaron Cross races to get his fix, in what seems like an overblown metaphor for the ideal viewer's addiction to chasing the Bourne dragon. 'No more', indeed."
surprisingly unpleasant
"You end up feeling sorry for all the actors forced to humiliate themselves, except for McConaughey, whose portrayal of sadistic, manipulative evil is mesmerizing."
"Doesn't seem to be concerned with approaching the storytelling from its political angle, instead settling for generic prison escape tropes and relatively tension-free plotting that eventually gets dragged down by repetitiveness"
A feather-light romantic comedy that's laborious when it ought to be effervescent; The Other End of the Line is the latest exchange in an awkward conversation between two film industries.
The romantic and medical twists that ensue may make you gag more readily than a stomachful of tranquilizers.
So ordinary it is headed for a quickie divorce from the audience
"You'd think Jackie Earle Haley as pedophile Freddy would kill. Oh, hardly."
"It's The Andy Griffith Show meets Seinfeld in the sack in Play the Game, which shows Andy is not too old to star in a sex comedy, I guess."
"So many people are being moved to think and feel things that this movie doesn't actually provide, which is usually a good thing. It just didn't happen for me."
"glitonei ti mayri trypa shedon apokleistika hari sti hazomara tis synthesis tis ideas tis tainias, poy kalyptei me ena campy peplo tin asynartisia tis ektelesis"
Kevin Clash fails to hold the screen as either a telegenic presence or as someone whose story is worthy of 76 minutes of anyone's time.
"As a consideration of faith and propriety, the movie never managed to boil my blood or break my heart."
"The script is very good within its limitations, but there is insufficient identification with the main characters."
"An intriguing, keenly observed journey, but one that demands too much patience from the audience."
Three Peaks never quite reaches the dramatic peak that the movie's deliberate pacing and tense interplay seem to promise.
"While the whole is diverting, the ending's utter repudiation of reality seems like pissing on the audience."
"The conceit of a strongarm hoodlum doubling as a concert pianist seemed really silly to me back in 1978, and it seems no less silly today."
"A little like Knocked Up, if Knocked Up were knocked up by Hot Rod and delivered by Dumb and Dumber."
"The Front Runner is a disappointing effort from Jason Reitman. It's all style and little substance, a Gary Hart masquerade."
"A preachy, episodic, arid movie that strains to be a culturally friendly/anonymous confection."
"Like the world's longest advertisement for cleaning products, Hateship Loveship might well have come with the tagline: scrub your way to a better life."
"Cue 90 minutes of dutiful twisting and turning, crossing and bloody double-crossing, but not one moment of actual surprise."
You're likely to still be searching for laughs when the credits roll.
Introducing the Dwights has its moments -- just not enough of them.
You may feel like taking a vow of abstinence yourself -- at least from Hollywood youth-sex comedies.
The worst kung fu movie since Sammo Hung's Heart of Dragon.
"It's just too bad ""The Old Guard"" chooses to restrict itself in terms of scope and ambition."
"...like witnessing your favorite slugger in a slump, or your favorite scorer go cold."
"In this dynamic, Hitchcock himself has something similar to Rebecca. If every remake is a way to revive that first love, fat Alfred also appears spectrally in each shot, reminding us how good the first version was"
"Often feels like an acting exercise documented on video for teaching purposes-lots of unnecessary histrionics and ostentatious zooms, with both the story and the improv-like dialogue predicated on contrivances and glaring improbabilities."
A rather offensive misfire of style.
Ronin plays like death warmed over!
"The entire movie is infused with a revolutionary, Year Zero spirit that becomes as exhausting as an undergraduate bull session."
"So reverential is this play of the play, the Bard would likely blush."
The very audience most likely to respond to blood and gunfire is least likely to respond to stridently delivered messages.
Plain and vanilla
"If it sends audiences home to log on to the Amnesty International website, terrific -- but that still doesn't make it a very good movie."
[E]veryone involved here goes through their motions with the attitude that there's a paycheck either waiting for them at the end of this or already safely deposited in the bank.
"A regrettable comedy, with no grace, no heart, and no message. [Full review in Spanish]"
Forget the mess 88 Minutes as it only takes five minutes for viewers to recognize a loser.
"Years on the Hannah Montana TV series have not adequately prepared Miley Cyrus for screen acting, even in a vehicle as unchallenging as this adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks novel."
"Here's a movie so cockeyed, the fact that Vin Diesel gives a decent performance isn't even the weirdest thing about it."
Leslie Nielsen plays it too straight in Mel Brooks' alleged comedy...
"Director Elie Chouraqui and co-writer Didier Lepecheur [fall] prey to a fatal evenhandedness that reduces a complex battle for the loveliest, most fought-over city in the world to a pile of heroic clichs."
Who is this for? Not the kid next to me squirming impatiently as Bella nearly dies of dehydration.
"A film that is fascinating to watch for the most part, and never dull, but without anyone for whom the audience can have a real rooting interest."
"If only the script had more attention given to details, then The Identical wouldn't have ended up looking like a pale imitation of what could have been a better movie."
"Dario Argento is much better than this. Hell, Asia Argento is much better than this."
"Works as a B-type monster movie, but considering both the prestige of its director and the franchise, it definitely could have been something more. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Sly Stallone writes, directs, produces, and stars -- a real quadruple threat, assuming you're talking about unintelligible, monotonous, pandering, and (presumably) incontinent."
"It's ambitious but, ultimately, a failure."
Unintentionally hilarious.
"I expected more humor, more fun, more action and ultimately, more scares and terror between the two big guys."
"For a reason I cannot fathom, Giant still has a reputation as a fine film, and it will no doubt go on boring audiences forever and a day."
"Red flags (not checkered) abound in the banal script, silly dialogue, and the age-defying stretch marks on the face of Burt Reynold."
Those viewers who watched NUEVE REINAS beforehand will be affected with increasingly unpleasant feeling of deja vu.
Excruciating!
 A cheesy C-movie polished up to look like a B&#46;
"As a big fan of the original, I'd just as soon not acknowledge this film exists. My hunch is that stars Eric Christian Olsen and Derek Richardson feel similarly."
Josh Kriegman and Elyse Sternberg's film never discovers a greater purpose beyond its undeniable sideshow appeal.
"A bogus, trumped-up 'inspirational' ending goes on forever and all but ruins everything."
This remake of Lina Wertmuller's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since John and Bo Derek made the ridiculous Bolero.
"For all the arresting imagery and intensity on display here, there doesn't seem to be a point to this very long film beyond a very obvious one: showing just how terribly stupid and destructive belief can be when not underpinned by some measure of reason."
There's precious little to like about the witless and decidedly tedious Black Knight.
"Starts out as a nifty satire, then turns ghastly for most of its running time."
"Quantumania is somehow heavy without feeling substantial, almost desperate in its dourness. Even scattered with occasional wisecracks, it makes Eternals feel positively breezy by comparison."
Performers capable of exquisite work elsewhere are undirected here.
A fantastic performance from Mary Elizabeth Winstead and some well-staged action can't prevent Kate from falling into over-familiar and derivative territory.
"If you go to the movies to ogle topless young women, Simon is definitely for you. If, on the other hand, you want something more cerebral with your $10 ticket and overpriced snacks, stay clear of this Dutch melodrama."
Although it may work for its target audience - video game-consuming pre-teen boys - other viewers may find the production to be lacking in anything beyond a little visual razzle-dazzle.
"Broader, bigger and more traditional than Boden and Fleck's previous work-- and unfortunately, significantly less successful."
"Return of Xander Cage has no regard for the existence of ""the top,"" so there's no time to care about going over it."
I was bored to tears (of a prosaic hue).
...the nadir of Sandler's progressively underwhelming filmography...
"More a dark fairy tale about vengeance than the action-packed crime thriller it purports to be, the film is at times exhilarating, bold, and beautiful -- when it's not busy being ludicrous, fragmented, and just plain stupid."
There's nothing terribly wrong with The November Man in a serviceable late-night cable TV sort of way but neither is there anything terribly right about it. It's unnecessary and derivative.
"This is a British film so depressingly bad that cinemas should play the adagietto from Mahler's Fifth over a loudspeaker as audiences file out grimly into the foyer afterwards, silently asking themselves if life has any value."
Feels like a rough sketch of a movie rather than a fleshed-out joke-dense script.
Instead of tossing the bouquet&#44; Jennifer Lopez unloads semi-automatic weapons on a band of brazen pirates who dare to crash her umpteenth matrimonial flick&#46; It&#8217;s as dumb as it sounds&#46; Perhaps&#44; even dumber&#46; 
"Luke Scott's directorial debut is too derivative of previous science fiction films, although the performances are good."
Neither as moving nor as illuminating as it should be.
After about an hour ... the film undergoes a precipitous decline marked by absurdity and Victorian sentiment.
Kramer's grating bombast exists only to call attention to itself as well as the complete absence of any moral implications or recognizable human behavior in the film.
The fact that Dusty is actually a bit of a sad sack is something a smarter movie could have developed. But director Sean Anders's film tells a basic story in which strutting males repeatedly lock horns to varying degrees of comic effect.
Essentially everything here is macho-posturing eye candy.
It's become so tiresome watching [Neeson] play the same character again and again that the film is even more forgettable than usual.
I like Stiles and Thomas together. I did not like the movie in which they found themselves stuck.
"With all due respect for Harris's ability to overact even while underacting, and given the hour-plus of citywide demolition, the stakes for the action here are awfully low."
"As for Mr. Chan, he has some passably choreographed bits with folding chairs, a bicycle and, later, some pots and pans at Gillian's house. But it's hardly enough to redeem -- or even make bearable -- this half-hearted hodgepodge."
A horrifically dreadful vampire teensploitation entry.
"The movie needs twenty more minutes, five fewer subplots, and a compass."
"Typically hollow and patchy, the script is low par for the course, the acting close behind."
A disappointing follow-up to Midnight in Paris.
"For a Jacobean-style drama about deadly emotions, the film lacks passion; only in the final half-hour, with Michael Nyman's funereal music supplying a welcome gravity, does it at last exert a stately power."
"There should have been more put to the end of the film...there was a lot left on the table that we didn't get to see. You'll definitely enjoy the soundtrack, though."
"Mo' monsters, mo' problems."
"Contains the germ of a great movie, but it's quickly over, and then we're back to the dogs."
A Black experience film whose horror satire is good for a few laughs.
Simply horrible.
Half-baked.
...this could very well be the premise for an off-the-wall new sitcom...
"The final effect... is a disheartening vacuum. Having torn down a myth, it leaves little but a dropped mic in its wake."
"This gothic retelling, which basically strips the play to its bare essentials, never really wakes up."
Loud music and an awful lot of swearing fail to disguise the obvious shortcomings.
"Works on a fairly basic espionage level, though like most of the author's post-Cold War work it lacks the complexity and nuance that marked his earlier novels."
"This movie worries that humanity is wasting its potential, which is a bizarre fear for a movie that has this many nonsensical shootouts. But that's what on Besson's mind: the Big Bang and bang-bang."
"There's barely a laugh on the horizon as Fun Size ambles through a series of unremarkable set pieces, tumbleweed one-liners and awkward tonal shifts."
If it had been a complete drama or a complete comedy it would have been a better film. The schizoid approach just didn't work.
"During the fallow opening minutes of The Brothers Solomon, I started keeping track of how much time would elapse before it made me laugh. Still waiting."
"If you're going to start unravelling those titular 45 years in 95 minutes, you need to bring a little more to the table."
"Wan humor, no spark."
"...the final act is a slow fizzling out, which takes longer than the story's momentum can maintain. There's rarely such an obvious cause and effect. It's such a shame."
"The true story is extraordinary; the film is not, although the actors are all fine."
"The epic film is a breakthrough in transforming a painting into a moving picture, but sadly the drama doesn't rise to the level of its novelty and ambition."
What was appealing and understandably reserved in print is practically glum on screen.
"It's rare that a movie fails on absolutely every level, but ""Moms' Night Out"" is a remarkably vivid example."
"Dead Snow 2: Red vs Dead is a film that wants to make you like it, but succeeds only in making you wish you liked it more."
"I'm not sure The Tree of Life is as bad as The New World, but it's certainly more pretentious."
"Rough Night feels like a rough draft, one that could have used at least one more pass by its writers before committing it to the screen."
"Once the finest hack minds in Hollywood finished fleshing out this project, they took the pregnancy-is-hard message and matched it up to characters with the hubris to believe otherwise. With (un)hilarious results."
...the film doesn't just run out of laughs; it becomes positively leaden by the last half hour.
Babe needed a sequel as much as Citizen Kane or Casablanca.
Take away the cameos -- in the recording booth&#44; and animated on-screen -- and you get something that&apos;s a little too close to the same old junk&#46;
"A charm-free wisp of a movie about that most annoying of recent archetypes: the mopey, privileged adolescent."
"Here we have a nightclub where Mick Jagger danced with Truman Capote, and the drama of the film is two bare-chested hunks shouting 'You've changed, man!' while carrying tubs of dirty glasses."
A compendium of dull gangster shenanigans which shirks hard reality at every turn.
"Yes, Spirited Away is a triumph of imagination, but it's also a failure of storytelling."
"On the page, it sounds like everything you might expect from a Tom Clancy story, but... Clancy's work is often revered for its more cerebral qualities, [and] those are conspicuously absent here."
"The movie never quite commits to one tone, instead half-heartedly trying out wacky comedy, sweet romance and inspirational drama."
It's complete trash and makes a mockery of Holmes's vaunted deductive reasoning.
Some comics just shouldn't be turned in to movies...
It's an action movie without an exciting moment. It's a special effects flick with chintzy visuals. And it's a Gerard Butler vehicle without enough Gerard to go around.
"Voyagers is not a film blessed with subtlety, especially not when it comes to laughable wild animal montages when the kids go, err, wild"
"Dull, jokey, and insubstantial!"
"As a suspense film, The Bodyguard delivers a big chill. And as a love story, it erects a grand canyon between its unromantic, reluctant Romeo and its glitzy, but boring Juliet."
Concussion is an interesting story that's diminished by it's own apparent desire to be seen as significantly greater than the sum of its parts.
"As Ouija board movies go, Witchboard is a lot better, and Witchboard isn't even all that good."
The result is that a story with a couple of good ideas founders for lack of a third or fourth good idea.
"...yes, Survivor's Eye of the Tiger can be heard on the soundtrack - a whopping and wholly unnecessary three times..."
"The troll scenes offer a mix of neon pastels that suggest someone ate a Lisa Frank store and promptly regurgitated it, while Bergentown features the vast spectrum of tones you might find in a baby's full diaper."
"To its credit, the movie eschews cheap dramatics, but at times it eschews dramatics altogether."
"A well-made but empty spectacle that is missing dread, thrills, and, most importantly, variation."
"It won't do much for grown-ups, but a camp slumber-party classic is born."
When the wind isn't tearing the town apart it's as if Quale doesn't know what to do with the characters or the story.
"A clunky, middling rehash of tired apocalyptic-fiction tropes."
"Well, I'm not sure the world needed two whole minutes of a gastrically panicked Neil Patrick Harris defecating in hats."
"Innocuous and sporadically diverting, but also formulaic and undistinguished."
"It's lazy filmmaking for a lazy audience, and it's truly shameful."
"The film shares many qualities with its rambling and at times honestly endearing characters: it's sloppy, decent-hearted and most often embarrassing."
[T]his movie leaves one with the discomforting feeling of watching a grudge taken way too far...
"Sooner or later Taylor Lautner is going to have to stop excelling despite the limitations his films put upon him. For now, he'll have to make do with surviving one of the year's worst films."
"Nostalgia aside, original fans have outgrown this, and what newcomers will discover is stale and--not unlike a turtle--puny and unable to get off its back."
"This feels almost like a parody of Almodovar, with its melodramatic tone and themes of gender, identity, sex and revenge."
"A mix of trashy and classy, ""Red Sparrow"" is a sleek, juiced-up espionage thriller that overdoes everything: its brutal violence, its dramatic flourishes, its hairpin plot twists, and most certainly its sexpot shamelessness."
"James creates a witty, confident everyman in the first act, only to sacrifice him to the pic's demands for formula and sentimentality thereafter."
The sort of inane rom-com drivel that Hollywood recycles on a regular basis.
"Sarah Francis is about to start a new teaching job when first her boyfriend dumps her, and then her grandmother dies, leaving her Patrick, a prized and pampered pug. A Disney dud."
"An exercise in naive commentary and globe-trotting magical realism, the film dares viewers to take it seriously."
"The Possession of Hannah Grace isn't the kind of bad movie that warrants midnight screenings and rowdy crowds; it's the kind of bad movie that quietly fades from memory, leaving the world no better and no worse than if it had never existed to begin with."
"The effort is more akin to laying a thick, sugary sauce onto what demands a more organic, natural purity."
"""Keeping Up with the Joneses"" sometimes clicks thanks to the commitment brought by the cast, but it's too often shackled with a tired plot to really make the most of its potential."
This is easily one of the worst films I've ever seen.
"Weird enough to keep it moderately entertaining at times, but only barely."
The Jazz Singer has so many things wrong with it that a review threatens to become a list.
anyone who has seen the trailer has seen a good 80% of anything worth watching here

There is something inherently mindless and preposterously silly about the whole exercise.
"This live-action adaptation of an animated children's fantasy series is a leaden, joyless ride that represents another major misfire from the once-promising filmmaker."
"Coming from one of the great, unsung masters of satirical horror-comedy, Joe Dante, it's surprising that this otherwise likable movie is such a disappointment."
"It's way out there, but not effective enough."
This Hellboy is neither shocking nor camp despite its R-rated bloody beheadings and dismemberments ...this movie is just one helluva bloody mess.
"It hopes that its mundane structure is enough to keep up with its soaring aspirations. Like its lovesick protagonists, it hopes in vain."
"Sometimes, looking good isn't enough."
Generic haunted-house story will have trouble standing out from a crowded summer theatrical environment.
"Is it possible for a movie to give you a stroke? Granted, I am not a Hilary Duff fan, but this movie is a great example why."
"True love has a funny way of revealing any current or previous imitations, but the lethargic Something from Tiffany’s doesn’t offer any of the laughs that ought to go along with that."
If you're looking for an animation that is rife with pop culture references and riffs on fairytales; save yourself the agony and watch Shrek instead.
"Brittany Runs A Marathon winds up feeling like a story told by an outsider who's empathetic toward, but not fully immersed in, a specific lived experience."
"The Book of Henry has a lot of compelling individual scenes, but they never come together as a satisfying whole."
The film may succeed as a simplistic introduction to a complex event in American history. But some of it is just depressingly lame.
"Here, the new nemesis is as uninspired, unexplained, and unimpressive as imaginable."
Those looking for a straight action-crime flick will be disappointed or horrified. Probably both.
Ardent fans of the musical will rejoice for any reason to revisit the iconic songs and enthralling reinvention by genius Tim Minchin&#59; all others will likely yearn for the Matilda struck into public consciousness nearly three decades prior&#46;

"hardly lives up to its promise, or even its title."
"Despite its continual profanity and sexual references, it isn't particularly offensive, just mostly forgettable."
Perpetuating the idea that people with disabilities are entitled fat cats isn't a good look.
"Despite aesthetic merit, it's a depressing and emotionally barren film that fails to hold interest."
We&#8217;re left with a lot of questions and too many ideas that never get the full treatment they deserve&#46;
"An excruciating, unendurable stinker from first frame to last."
"Full of violence and blood-spattered gunplay, it's a visually grotty film buoyed mainly by Gibson's never-say-die performance."
"[M]ay as well be set on another planet - a world where everyone is perfect, (except the one guy who is bad), the weather is wonderful (even when it rains) and you can support yourself off of tips from the lunch shift."
"Peppered with supporting characters who prove little more than fodder for Myers' rampage, the film is intermittently smart and witty, but rarely frightening."
&#8220;I want to be romantic&#44; but not too corny&#44;&#8221; explains the perfectionist groom whose romantic comedy about prenuptial drama fails on both counts&#46;
"There's an inspirational story lurking within The Hip Hop Project, but directors Matt Ruskin and Scott K. Rosenberg can't quite seem to bring it out."
"Eliminators boasts a shaky plot and terrible dialogue, but the fights - including a scrap inside one of the gondolas on the Thames cable car - are brawny enough to keep fans of the genre satisfied."
"Sadly, The Incredible Jessica James is only isn't up to par with the tremendous talent of the former Daily Show correspondent, who still brings her keen observational comedy and wit to this Netflix romantic comedy only to have it wasted."
"But as a horror movie, a haunting movie, a ghost movie, this movie just fails because it's so boring. For so long nothing happens, then when things do happen, it's all a jump scare."
"We the people deserve every nutty coincidence, beautiful disaster, luxurious grief montage, and supernatural final-act reveal. Garbage-entertainment is still entertainment. Why, then, does The Choice almost entirely opt out of its own game?"
It stumbles along as you're forced to sit through quite a bit of umming and aaahing and a car chase that lasts five minutes too long.
"The movie feels a lot like slacker brother Ben: a little sloppy, mostly predictable, some flashes of poignancy and wisdom, but ultimately doesn't live up to its potential."
"Captive, to my chagrin, never finds its story -- that is, it never finds the meaning, the arc, the narrative that justifies its retelling."
An astoundingly awful film.
A whiff of the ridiculous taints every scene.
"It is like a cilice itself, confining and constraining the characters, the story and, finally, the audience -- but never drawing blood."
"This cloying, voices-from-the-other-side story is hell."
"To introduce some sense of danger, the screenwriters have to introduce a sub-plot involving comic drug-peddlers, but this only speeds up a lethargic movie without making it funnier. Three Men and a Baby is a lifeless film."
"The stunt casting is so poorly realized that actors pop in and out of the film at random, the story apparently stitched together according to actors' schedules."
"I kept asking myself one thing throughout the duration of this above-average, aliens vs. average Joes comedy: Where are Simon Pegg and Nick Frost?"
"Adapted from a graphic-novel series (and what isn't these days?), this unholy mess of horror and Western clichs is, at least, blessed with a wonderfully loony premise."
Tom Conti is good value as a fleet-footed bar owner and the dance sequences are vigorously staged but the story is plodding and perfunctory and has no connection with the earlier film...
"The desire for a morose narrative mystery, the disorientation of the spectator to what happens and the demiurgic torment of its characters taste like worn cliche. [Full review in Spanish]"
Grant has never been less charming and Parker never less fashionable or more grating than they are as Paul and Meryl Morgan.
"Although the show has merit and Lopez delivers a remarkably compelling and extremely likable performance, the picture suffers from terminal blandness and leaves too many questions unanswered."
"All glitz and glibness, the film makes 1960's ego party, which had the mock substance of happy-hour celebrity, seem rather deep."
The most frustrating entry into a series that has never set the bar terribly high.
A Wikileaks story that fails to match the drama of its real-life inspiration.
"It's meant to be thrilling fun, but it never takes off in the way imagined. There's no merriment in the .357-caliber chaos, no mirth in the staccato of bullets."
"Roth's ham-fisted approach here suggests that he is trying to stage his own version of Clint Eastwood's overrated, Oscar-nominated Mystic River."
Destined to be a favorite...on cable TV.
As exact a copy of Ordinary People as it could be without Mary Tyler Moore hanging around somewhere.
"With no leavening agents to lighten the mood, the recipe suffers from a tacky texture and sticky residue of melodrama."
"A film that will please the blood buffs, mildly amuse the kiddies and make the adults say 'puh-lease'."
Pleasant but overfamiliar.
High-impact but shallow.
"A carefully conceived, thoughtfully orchestrated effort in taste and restraint that ultimately is too restrained and tasteful."
The feature debut of writer-directed Elizabeth Wood tries and fails to balance being harrowing and disarmingly funny.
"A kinda supernatural, kinda psychological thriller that establishes a perplexing situation and never gets around to figuring it out."
...a lackluster adaptation of a rather disappointing McEwan work.
"[C]rams three times the hoo-hah [of the first film] into a 3D CGI theme-park ride, yet reduces itself to one-third the fun..."
"Portrait feels like an elegant party, full of attractive people, beautiful finery and tremendous music (from Wojiech Kilar), yet no excitement. And no matter how many times you revisit the place, it never gets better."
[W]hat does Spielberg expect us to take from all this? Should we be amused? Touched? Inspired? It certainly doesn't require us to think.
"What starts as a somewhat charming - if prosaic - story of love in the time of gentrification inexplicably spends most of its third act mired in the finer points of apartment hunting, like a tastefully lit HGTV show."
"The story is so poorly-plotted, nonsensical, and misogynist that it's hard to imagine one person liking this material, much less millions of literate book lovers."
"""Homefront"" is hard not to like and impossible to respect."
"A movie that seems to have been made by people who don't understand the history, true nature or appeal of their iconic characters."
Coincidence follows coincidence as the story moves predictably toward its pre-determined ending. But not before Winant and Holzman parade an annoying array of thinly drawn eccentrics and weirdos across the screen by way of fleshing things out.
There&#8217;s plenty to admire in Nope but the overall delivery felt convoluted and disjointed - it threatened to be great but never really got close&#46;
"As with most sugary indulgences, G.I. Joe's sweet, dizzying high is followed almost immediately by a painful crash."
"Unlike the tome, this movie is neither useful nor necessary."
"Padilha protracts Murphy's existential ordeal,so that the revenge plot that motivates the action becomes secondary to Murphy's struggle to hold onto his identity even as political, corporate and scientific interests seek to erase it."
"It all comes to an end with a sudden, baffling full-stop that totally whiffs and seems like it was found in post-production, not planned in the least."
"Today's terrorism paranoia, apparently, is too complex and too faceless for some. No, we need a clear-cut enemy. Do you have something in red?"
"It is impossible to take a movie like this seriously. Unfortunately, the movie tries to force us to do just that a few times too many."
It's hard to say which is the most embarrassing moment in John Travolta's longtime dream movie of L. Ron Hubbard's 1982 novel.
"A toothless message movie, timidly espousing homogenized morals and terrified of offending anyone."
"Ultimately the movie mimics the trajectory of the quest itself, pulling one toward its final destination, but across an arid expanse."
Doing justice to the sport but not entirely to the drama which suffers from choppy introductions and half-hearted class distinctions in Mark Frost's screenplay.
You People is a missed opportunity&#44; a half-assed reinterpretation that is only sporadically funny&#44; and without the heart or the substance that this story would need for it to truly work&#46;
Don't remember him this way.
The least watchable movie ever to star Tom Hanks...
Go Fish features a largely non-professional cast -- and there are too many scenes where the players' lack of acting ability shows. The result is a labored quality.
"Winstead is a believable badass, dispatching wave after wave of interchangeable bad guys with ease... but the characters and narrative are as thin as the paper walls Kate paints with the blood of Yakuza henchmen."
"some witty social observations, but there are also some slapstick scenes that feel as if they were taken from a completely different movie."
"The story collapses in the second half of this initially promising mess and it appears that, even after 1,935 years, the tragedy of Pompeii is still too soon to trivialize."
DeNiro is pretty much the only reason to see Meet the Fockers...[betrays] creative exhaustion.
Will entertain the kids but it should have been a Disney Channel movie
"Ivory has been away from period literary adaptations, backbone of the Merchant Ivory reputation, for some time. It's good to have him back, but Golden Bowl shows he needs to do some work to reacquire his golden touch."
There's precious little space in Despereaux's tale for heroism (save for the third act) and humor.
"Aiming to be insightful melodrama about the communication barriers between men and women, and the true meaning of love, Mercury in Retrograde is hoisted on its own petard and ends up distancing rather than embracing salient topics it attempts to tackle."
Never has a film tried so hard to emulate the look and feel of a video game than Jung Byung-gil&#8217;s dizzyingly ridiculous Carter&#46;
"[The film features] episodic set pieces with disorienting action, culminating in a face-off that defies logic in its resolution."
"If you know a lot about the two filmmakers, what's on screen is so elementary, PBS boring, not helped by Bob Balaban's schoolmarm narration."
Script full of plotholes so large they have their own zip codes.
"Pleasant but consistently rather bland, a light, low-key Lifetime movie with an A-list star and wide theatrical distribution."
"[VIDEO ESSAY] Writer-director-actor Josh Radnor follows up his debut feature (""Happythankyoumoreplease"") with a compact romantic comedy that almost works, but not quite."
A shell game without a pea.
"[Beckinsale] deserves better, and looks like she knows it."
Waititi is incapable of dealing with the twin horrors of oppression and indoctrination beyond cheap-seats sentimentality and joke-making.
"The Gift lacks either Fincher's talent for dense plotting or Hitchcock's elegance. Long passages in the middle seem repetitive, as Edgerton leans on jump-scares over and over."
A hard-R comedy that at least makes an attempt to present us with real people rather than just receptacles for dick-and-puke jokes.
"A laugh-free, thoroughly unpleasant comedy..."
An underwhelming and lethargic drama that can't be saved by its strong performances.
What to remake next? 'My Bloody Valentine' or 'Sorority House Massacre'?
"Feels like it was made by some old Bolsheviks, who, in a vodka stupor, thought they were remaking THE GODFATHER."
"Ideal Home is a pretty average comedy with some laughs thanks to the lead performances, but its messy script, Fleming's self-conscious direction and predictable storytelling bring it down a notch."
The only way to derive any enjoyment from King Arthur is to bear in mind it's more of a Jerry Bruckheimerian tale than an Arthurian one.
Only Sandra Bullock shines as Harper Lee.
"A baffling screenplay in which all the characters speak in the same, pretentious voice, stylistically vapid direction and non-existent drama add up to a fatal verdict."
"Until the diverting special effects take center stage, this story, about an alien intelligence that builds an army out of flesh and metal, pathetically exploits genre conventions without generating self-reference, camp, or thrills."
Transforms Shakespeare's most complex works into a morass of paralyzing drudgery.
The Duke of Burgundy is like Fifty Shades of Grey as staged by Masterpiece Theater.
More loud silliness.
"Already in the grip of this crisis, animals - and us - deserve better than this partial survey."
"Shutter coughs up another vengeful ghost in the form of a spurned Japanese waif who appears in photographs and sets about getting her message across as many ghosts do -- in the most indirect, passive-aggressive, logic-defying way imaginable"
"The Skulls turns out to be such a mediocre, listless effort."
"Hopelessly one-dimensional, with Bissell making a terrible television movie about a volatile showdown between combustible personalities."
Dumb. Very dumb.
The plot is such hooey...and the plot holes so gaping that End of Days proves more exasperating than enjoyable. [Blu-Ray]
"It may be historically accurate, but there's nothing interesting about this lady, this duke, or this movie."
"It's a mellow journey backed by an acoustic guitar soundtrack, never building any emotional response stronger than the warm fuzzies."
"Though stunningly shot, scored and directed, the almost wordless Flamenco pales as one musical number simply follows another."
"The passage of time hasn't improved this version one iota, although at least home viewers don't have to subject themselves to the lobby posters sporting that year's daftest tagline (""Evil Loves To Party"")."
Someone should have stopped Red Lights.
Can take its place among animated films unexceptional in their depiction of humans and among a long line of B-movies about small bands of mercenary heroes who save a world or city or town as filmgoers know it.
"The jokes are so unremittingly cheap, so purely predictable, that ""Porky's"" is less shocking or amusing than boring."
"While an interesting visual accomplishment, Synchronicity's allegiance to its forebears only reminds us in how it pales in comparison."
"There are a couple of engaging sequences...but indeed the remainder is mostly mediocre, and ultimately forced."
"It’s ironic that for a film about precisely curated emotions, the Netflix algorithm winds up flattening out any promise of depth."
"A case of having your cheesecake and eating it, too."
... generic and predictable ...
"...the halfhearted result of hundreds of sports movie and coming-of-age-flick clichs, thrown together without even the slightest care or reason."
"Without fail, every time I found myself liking this movie, it would break the spell with its ulterior motives."
Best left on the shelf to collect dust.
"Aside from turning the title on its head, this new take on the Brothers Grimm does little that is memorable..."
"Hillcoat and Cave clearly have astute ideas to impart, but their passion for gore and grime overwhelms all intellectual activity."
There are about fifteen minutes of fun buried deep in Jean-Fran&#231;ois Richet&#8217;s Plane&#44; but the journey to get there is one that requires wading through a narrative slog that is largely devoid of any prevailing spark&#46;
"Dramatically thin, formally uninspired and thematically weak, ""The Last Ride"" really goes nowhere."
"It has, finally the air of a project that was made out of a sense of obligation rather than a drive to entertain, to amaze."
"The movie does have a few brief, bright spots, and the actual 20-minute battle between Batman and Superman offers some enjoyment. But overall, this film should have been way more satisfying."
Will probably stand as one of the film year's biggest letdowns.
Sure Solaris is ambitious. Even audacious. But too many plot points are left to the audience's imagination without any explanation whatsoever.
"Another shambling 1990's I.P. gets its shot at relevance, but this unfunny and ultimately dull attempt makes you wonder how so many talented artists made something so lame."
"A film that, unfortunately, with a very ephemeral result. [Full review in Spanish]"
The movie&#8217;s too-brief runtime&#44; punctuated by overtly hasty pacing&#44; leaves the story undeveloped and characterizations raw to the point that viewers might simply feel as if they were abruptly thrown into the final act of another movie
"Kiss of the Dragon offers just about a kill a minute, but less than a thrill a minute."
"The characters are too arbitrarily drawn, they verge on the merely eccentric."
As artificially sweet as one of Molly's lollipops - and about as satisfying one too: They Came Together is a breezy romp through the rom-coms of yesteryear that might just leave you craving the real thing.
"Malek's Freddie is a musical performance for the ages, but the film he's trapped in is the three-minute radio edit that the character and real songwriter would have never settled for."
"""15:17"" a well-intentioned misfire."
Yet another aggressively dull G.I. Joe movie.
"The story of an aging, self-hating homosexual who goes home alone to his lacquered town house feels ancient as well as uncomfortable for the writer-director."
You never get any explanation of who these people are or why they do what they do.
"OK, I get it now: Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg are agents of Satan himself, and their recruitment video is Meet the Spartans...a new low even for these diseased buffoons."
"This movie tells an important story, but there's something off about My Best Friend Anne Frank. At the very least, the title is misleading.https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/my-best-friend-anne-frank"
"Orphans is a good play about behavior that has been turned into a mediocre movie about nothing much at all. That is not intended as a criticism of the filmmakers, but simply as an observation about the nature of the material."
"After the disorienting first half hour, things get less interesting as they become clearer."
The laughs are scattered and hopefully in ten years the work of Marc Lawrence will also be non-existent and left in the Wal-Mart bargain bins where they belong without a divider.
"The laughs are few and far between, some bad CG effects mar the better sequences, Depp's performance doesn't have the lustre it once had, and the movie's plot doesn't so much defy logic as tie it up and make it walk the plank."
"The movie's silly-arty aesthetic is regurgitated Polanski, and there's a shameless script steal from Presumed Innocent."
Gives Gigli serious competition for worst film of the year honors.
A disappointingly plastic addition to both the Lego and ninja cannons.
"""San Andreas"" plays as if the four screenwriters shopped at the disaster-movie supermarket, grabbing all the clichés they could from the clearance aisle and stuffing them in a cart."
"There's a good movie to be made about the violent world of British soccer, or football, as it's called on the other side of the pond. This isn't it."
"If you're looking for an adventure in summer camp, pencil in The Notebook."
"After seeing Gere and Roberts play much smarter people, it is painful to see them dumbed down here."
"Despite the high speed car chases and the gleaming high-tech weaponry, 'The Bourne Supremacy' is empty of any lasting impressions."
"As a creature feature, Riddick isn't half bad, though it's far from truly good."
"If it were a half-hour shorter -- and thus better-focused, story-wise -- I would recommend it. As it stands, I have some beautiful mental snapshots of the scenery and the locals, but I can't imagine taking the trip again."
"For as ""fun"" as Skiptrace might be, there's never a strive to do anything different or memorable throughout the goofy buddy comedy."
"It is unremittingly agonizing to sit through this nonsensical, feeble attempt at comedy, lowlighted by Kate McKinnon's unappealing, annoying performance that's like a grain of sand in your eye."
"A dismal, inane and laughable screenplay."
"Gavin Hood's Official Secrets isn't a poor film so much as an unremarkable one, and if there is any suspense or stylistic innovation to be wrung from this important story then the director is keeping it under his hat."
"'Look, they're grown men! And they behave like children!' Lather. Rinse. Repeat."
"So few films are totally aimed at kids, and tearing this one to shreds is not pleasurable."
Any goodwill evaporates when placed alongside the presence of Denise Richards as Dr. Christmas Jones.
"All in all, ""Earth to Echo"" is passable family entertainment, neither unforgettable nor particularly bad."
"The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners."
"Almost all the shortcomings of the film are balanced out by Denzel Washington's performance. He is simply fun and exciting to watch, even when he's doing some fairly cheesy things, like being haunted by victims or talking to dead bodies in the morgue."
"It's not a scary movie, it's a vampire movie. And in reality, it's kind of a bad vampire movie."
"Christopher Neil directs with a mechanical blandness made more tedious still by a score of gentle guitar strumming so aggravatingly benign it might inspire you to partake in one of Wendy's climactic, cathartic primal screams."
"It's not fun to enter a movie-viewing experience asking, ""Does this movie need to exist?"" My Friend Dahmer, an adaptation of the 2012 graphic novel by Derf Backderf.. is one of these."
"""Teen Wolf Too"" is so awful you want to howl out loud..."
Relies on bad faith arguments&#44; ahistorical information&#44; and cherry-picked scenes used out of context&#46;
The style and energy of Kids vs&#46; Aliens makes it an entertaining enough watch but it lacks the standout characters or entertaining sequences to be memorable&#46; The production value at times seems intentionally cheap but I feel like I wasn&apos;t in on the joke&#46;
Really bad. Sometimes funny
It's very earnest and very safe. Everyone explains everything that they are thinking in the most poignant way every time. It is very predictable and expected.
"When it comes to the music, Dream of Life almost makes up for all its other wandering failings."
"The action relies on actual game footage. The film doesn't even try to reenact the scenes with the actors, creating a tangible disconnect with the audience."
Somebody might want to mention to Shyamalan that taking potshots at critics in films rarely works. Remember Roland Emmerich's lame attack on Siskel and Ebert in his awful reworking of 'Godzilla?'
"I couldn't tell whether the film was intended to be a comedy; as it became more and more improbable, both predictable and ludicrous at once, I heard audience members chortle again and again. Were they laughing with ""Money Monster"" or at it?"
"If this is history demystified, give me myth."

"Beyond the sun burn and baby oil, the film's similarities with its source material can barely squeeze into its little red trunks."
It's a ragbag of action scenes which needed to be bandaged more tightly.
"At the end of her spontaneous date, she says it's been the best night of her life. It will not be one of yours."
"Reflecting influences ranging from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre to Rosemary's Baby to -- well, you name it -- Bleed doesn't exactly break any new ground, stylistically or otherwise."
"I didn't hate Philomena, but it's a little complacent about its power to touch a middlebrow audience."
"This story about three mob wives taking the reins after their husbands are imprisoned is uneven, at best."
"An acting exercise weighed down by costumes, make-up, and over-lighting that has a few things to say about the backbone of a great world leader but nothing you haven't really heard before."
"Believable and engaging, Fanning nearly renders the ensuing bore watchable"
A promising premise goes nowhere in Spiderhead.
"The story could definitely use further exploring but sadly, the narrative form of La Tragedia De Macario steers it away from the interesting and turns it into the monotonous."
"Unfortunately... while Rocky Balboa deepened and expanded an iconic character, Rambo creates an even bloodier caricature of the one-man army many viewers remember."
"Levy's film is neither fun nor exciting. He's stuffed it with special effects, star names and big numbers, but it has none of the exuberance needed to lift us out of our seats and take us on a thrilling ride."
...one of the most disastrous would-be comedies to come around in quite some time...
"The picture is about as memorable as a nondescript television soap opera, which is something that the lead character dotes upon."
"For a film that postures itself as being artistic, it seems mostly obsessed with exploitation."
"The story's enchantment feels forced and coy, its mysteries tricked-up and flimsy."
"Having expressed every cogent thought in its head in the first 50 minutes, Wizard drags along for another tortuously repetitive hour and half, a long day's journey into utter banality."
"Drenched in adrenaline, veiled in violence, 'The Expendables' really is. Expendable, I mean."
This new version looks more like a Japanese monster movie than its famous predecessor. [Full Review in Spanish]
A pretty lame premise.
... a dull compendium of recycled adventure epic cliches.
"Although the idea raised by [director] Daniel Goldhaber may be interesting, the development is disastrous. [Full review in Spanish]"
Producers smooshed the plots of two Sarah Dessen teen novels into one flick.
"The one bright spot is the spirited cast, whose genuine good cheer ameliorates the obnoxious self-reflexivity of the writing and direction."
Convoluted action thriller.
"A cheap, ugly, forgettable footnote to the seemingly endless superhero boom."
It holds within it a great idea&#44; when one disentangles it from the hairball that is the EEAAO narrative&#46; But &#91;&#46;&#46;&#46;&#93; in all its originality&#44; it telegraphs its message&#44; instead of allowing this intricately constructed ingenious world to be the message&#46;
"A brisk, messy, and wholly laughable take on cutthroat business politics"
"This veers a little too haphazardly between being a message movie and one of those films about an unlikely friendship. In the end, it fails to work as either."
"The style of the film is characteristic of the director... But this time the method defeats itself. In rejecting every irrelevant action, in ruthlessly refining away every decoration, Bresson has thrown away the motives as well. "
"In terms of feeling like this production genuinely delivered, that's one mountain The Sound of Music Live! just couldn't climb."
"The Superstar script is often dumb, sometimes derivative and frequently mean."
"The second half is clumsier than the first, and you get the impression that the studio rushed to cut things that hadn't worked in last fall's kids-skating flop and play up the Boyz aspects of the routine moral-dilemma plot."
"If you're looking for psychological depth, save your money - what little there is frankly, embarrassingly bad and the characters remain disappointingly shallow, despite their endless drip-feed of personal exposition..."
"Rule of thumb: if Arnold Schwarzenegger is the smartest person in a movie, you've got problems."
Even though the film turns out as a passable farce it doesn't have the same sting as the book.
"The strange lack of heart and muted...well, everything, prevents Dumbo from ever having the chance to truly soar."
"Nothing in the script is remotely surprising or very funny, though nothing is horrendous, either."
"It feels like three years to get to a point of resolution. Bandslam should take the lead of the rock gods: keep it moving, keep it simple, and know when to get off the stage."
Cheaper by the gross.
"A distant, atonal film that feels more slippery than evocative."
"The whole damn thing is ripe for the Jerry Springer crowd. It's all pretty cynical and condescending, too."
"To anyone who has experienced true grief, Dragonfly will seem nothing more than a cruel hoax."
"Piffle, really, with guitars."
"Lacks the sense of self-awareness, self-deprecation and smarts that make the comics tale so memorable."
Though the prep-school visual cues need revamping ... Club's inability to moralize saves it from kitsch.
Its sheer shameless juvenilia ranges from horribly unfunny to outrageously zany.
"Rough Night briefly gallops when these girls-gone-wild party, but once things take that unfortunate turn, the movie goes flat-footed: Logic dissipates and transitions stumble."
An assortment of every dance movie cliche from the last decade.
Moonfall is weapons-grade nonsense that severely tests our desire to go along for the ride no matter how ridiculous it gets.
The Gunman felt as long and made me as bored as the fancy rifle he initially shoots with.

The funfest comes with an OFF warning -- Only For Farleymeisters.
"What are we to say about a comedy that makes you walk out feeling lousy, that's like a parade of beaten virtue and (mostly) sadistic power?"
Simultaneously byzantine and dumb ...
"A dull, lifeless stinkbomb that plays like a 2 hour commercial for itself, hoping that the Gere-Roberts-Marshall combination is enough to warrant viewers' money. It isn't."
"It's a full-scale disaster, a misfire of megalithic proportions that somehow managed to snare an A-list cast...The reviews have been so relentlessly acidic that it could acquire a so-bad-it's-fun mystique that turns it into a cult film."
"Bless the Child has the static, bland look of a TV movie."
"Body-horror SF via Lovecraftian grotesquerie, with a now tedious rampage from Nic Cage. As if a man needs to be influenced by unfathomable aliens to turn to violence. I need more from my pulp fiction."
The fact that Mike and Dave will inevitably turn into a rom com blunts its potential as a black comedy of comeuppance for the titular jerks.
"Unfortunately, Agyness Deyn's acting chops aren't quite up to the task of carrying Sunset Song."
Detective Pikachu relies so heavily on fan recognition that it doesn't take enough time to flesh out the plot or make their characters people we want stick around with.
A formula flick.
"Fifty Shades of Black aims low (often at and around the crotch), and often fumbles around, missing its G-spot. That's the gag-spot, perverts."
"The Gallows has a cleverness that bobs, occasionally, above the surface of cesspool murk. You can't tell whether it's just flotsam or a corpse, but for most of the 80-minute run time it almost doesn't matter. It's at least something."
"Bland, generic and showing every sign of having been market-tested to death."
"[W]hile this particular effort has its atypicalities, it's too self-conscious in design and execution to be as idiosyncratic as it thinks it is."
"The ugly stuff in this movie is so over the top that sometimes you are forced to stifle a laugh, but the star always comes through."
"This film is just plain awful, despite the efforts of two enormously talented and likable stars who are ultimately done in by an impossible script."
"You're left with the realization that despite its philosophical intrigue, On Body and Soul remains a flawed film."
Death of a President manages to be predictable and astounding at the same time.
"Despite Kidman's best efforts, almost nothing clicks on an emotional level, and the movie passes as slowly as sand through an hourglass."
"Long before the end, it's an old-fashioned high tech army fighting the Mimics, who are as spirited and pretty as Blunt. The combat is endless and predictable."
"""Palo Alto"" is ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" without the wit; ""River's Edge"" without the depth. It's like reading a first novel by a talented writer who has something to say but isn't yet sure how to say it."
"Phoebe may not be schizophrenic, but any movie that simultaneously wants to trouble and reassure, to keep it real and then traffic in wish fulfillment, certainly is."
This isn&#8217;t a bad movie by any stretch&#44; but it&#8217;s too long and should have been way better&#44; given the opportunity presented&#46; Alas&#46;
"A bizarre mash-up of Fatal Attraction and Stephen King's Misery, with so many risible premises that it's hard to know where to begin."
"If The Big Year does anything, it highlights how far Martin, Black, and Wilson have fallen from the giddy, off-kilter humor they used to bring to projects."
"Let's put it this way: it's a 90-minute comedy, and I laughed just once (the guy in front of me spilled popcorn on his whiny date, if you must know)."
"The Ring Two is exactly what every horror film tries not to be, and that is boring."
"Not up to adequately framing the title's question, let alone answering it."
"Except for Connery, who is every inch the lion in winter, nothing here feels authentic."
"Just the latest quasi-magic-realist, two-birds-with-one-stone shrine to non-traditional families and the power of myth"
"From its assaultive, nihilistic prologue to its last flat invocation of American culture, The Guard foregrounds the extent to which it is leaning on artifice and affect to get over."
"Beyond its shapeless sense of the future, humdrum story and fairly routine plot mechanics . . . this flick mostly recycles old action-movie parts."
Lurches between treacle and terror as it stumbles toward a too-easy ending.
"Got an emotional jugular? Bajrangi Bhaijaan is coming for you, hammer and tongs."
[Joffe] isn't nearly as strong a director as he is a writer and he's unable to realize such an intricate story in a way that's even remotely satisfying.
The sort of comic frippery that's wearing thin with age and repetition.
It's the same haphazard collection of dumb family-embarrassment gags you could find in any comedy without the Vacation moniker.
"With its hunks and dolls masquerading as characters, its contrived and sleazy plot twists and tawdry sex, Gossip owes less to any film genre than to TV soap operas."
"In the bloody muddle ""Triple 9,"" Chiwetel Ejiofor, Anthony Mackie, Woody Harrelson and Kate Winslet manage to make a few scenes count."
Art doesn't have to be a Sisyphean feat in order to mean something ( ... ) a better version of our timeline is not automatically waiting at the other end.
"This is not a great movie, but it has some nice moments. It shows Goth kids need love too."
"Handled correctly, Wilde's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice. Here, alas, it collapses like an overcooked soufflé."
"With its uneven creative mix, Wimbledon drifts between sparkling, insightful humor and dull Hollywood nonsense."
"Cowboys reminded me of that old saying about how the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. This movie is nothing but good intentions, yet it's an aggravating experience anyway."
Bella expends so much effort hiding its agenda that it doesn't have time to give us a story until the very end.
"Wanted is a 14 year-old boy's fantasy - being given $3 million, a gun and Angelina Jolie as company. Your viewpoint of the film will depend on how well you can suspend disbelief and your opinions on casual violence."
Yet another example of Woody Allen's stratospheric obsolescence from anything that could be considered remotely zeitgeisty or vital.
Grim and joyless.
"""Don't Say a Word"" pleads on bended knee for its audience to abandon common sense."
"The Stag is an inoffensive debut for Butler, but a film on this subject needs a bit more cojones than this meek knockabout."
The term 'gentle' is too harsh a word to describe the pace of this tale which is so slow in places it's a wonder moss isn't growing on it.
A shrill and ultimately annoying tale.
All the bad-rehash mojo from Friday the 13th to The Blair Witch Project has infected Scott Kosar's script.
"Tiresome caper comedy has big stars, little appeal."
"Genre aficionados might enjoy the ultraviolent intensity, even if the result feels repetitive."
The film's pleasures are simply too elusive and mild to make up for a lack of narrative propulsion.
"If you're going to set the standard in animation, however lofty it may be, you best be prepared to live up to it. And Cars 2, it pains me to say, does not."
"Akin to a bad X-Men spin off.
[Full review in Spanish]"
"Guillermo del Toro doesn't rise above the obligations of staging a film of this sort as a multi-level video game, a stylish but programmatic ride toward an inevitable final boss battle."
Plays like Death of a Salesman without all the hard-hitting action.
"Inferno needs to move like a shot, but it crawls like an exhausted toddler."
It's a movie you forget while you're watching it.
Taking Lives nicks characters from other flicks without any shame.
Let's hope this slips away before everyone realizes that terrific hot chick from The Wolf of Wall Street stars in this. Will Smith goes through it looking angry at his agent.
Regardless of how good the movie looks&#44; by the end I was simply exhausted from the yelling&#46; I was left cold and unconvinced of the central relationship&#46; And I was left asking what was the point&#63;
&#91;I&#93;n the rush to add and resolve more and more problems for these characters&#44; those issues and their resolutions never feel authentic&#46;
Any criticism of a film like The Ladies Man is essentially moot.
"Hemsworth looks every bit the rugged outdoorsman, so it's a pity how disposable the script makes him."
"[Nicholson] makes Payne's film look better than it is, but he can't save it from being overlong, repetitious, and flat."
"Sadly, and despite all of its good-hearted intentions, it's one of the biggest disappointments."
"Swims in the murky waters of moral complexity, content to skim the surface without engaging fully with the questions it raises...delivers a disappointingly convoluted mystery plot in an attempt to give the audience what it thinks it wants."
"a confusing mess. ... a promising set-up assembled with bits and pieces of Gilliam's brilliance, but he clearly did not wake up in the middle of the night with a brilliant vision"
"Even in a genre that allows wordiness, however, the dialogue is overwritten. Reeves and Ryder too often sound like waspish columnists quoting their stuff at each other."
"Writer-director Keith Samples has pieced together scraps of bad sperm jokes, an inane 'rags-to-riches' story line, and a boring extra-marital affair for 'intrigue.'"
"CHIPS doesn't offer much in the way of comedy, plot, characters, or the betterment of humanity."
"I'm sure Dickerson has strong feelings about inner-city problems, but if he does he can't convey them."
"Despite some committed performances from a high-profile cast, it is yet another example of the need for someone, somewhere behind the scenes having an eye or an affinity for the community they're invested in depicting."
We expect more from the studio that brought us Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle.
Woman in Gold plays out like a filmic series of check-lists for legal and historical drama. It'll fit nicely into an AP Art History curriculum on a rainy day - only 20 flashbacks to go once you start.
The soundtrack makes generous use of trombones to indicate humor.
"Its feminist comedic pointers often times come across as a checklist of items writers would like to gender swap, as opposed to instinctive developments in the story."
The essential problem is that artifice for artifice's sake loses its fascination when divorced from human emotion or grand stakes.
It's a story that has been played out more times than can be counted and is none too fresh on this go-round. Street Kings simply brings nothing new to the 'bad cop' subgenre.
"This one is for the wee ones. While director Tom McGrath attempts to milk something from Michael McCullers script, the result isn't close to being satisfying."
More like a laborious 84-minute trailer.
The film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises.
The future looks pretty but dull.
"A flimsy opportunity to rubberneck at the misfortune of a profession where the summit of aspiration is ""getting lied to by a higher caliber of person."""
"Despite the obvious chemistry between Johnson and Blunt, along the way its jungle adventure becomes dull and gets lost like a canoe on the river as it follows the map of Disney's well-known formulas to the letter. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Conviction goes out the window, and stays there."
"Fantastic Four is an appetizer, teasing a meal that doesn't actually come. But it's also a palate cleanser, and one that establishes a darker F.F. universe I'm hopeful we can continue to explore."
A film distinguished entirely by its stubborn refusal to engage viewers in any way whatsoever.
No wonder these idiots are broke.
A banal mess that sacrifices anything resembling satire for a series of smutty jokes.
"An overlong period piece that's earnest and handsome, true, but strangely inert, and perhaps because Ernest Hemingway's larger-than-life persona is so familiar, frequently feels stilted and cliched."
"not great filmmaking, but very profitable and a fun way to get some cheap Halloween thrills."
"Brody is the epitome of the trustworthy, funny, approachable, but magnetic nice guy that you would marry in a second if he really existed. It was like Tom Hanks and John Cusack had a love child."
"This film should be campy fun, but in Bekmambetov's unsteady hands, it feels laboured and unsatisfying."
The latest urban fairy tale from Pretty Woman's Marshall sees the director continue his descent into underwritten schmaltz at the expense of genuine wit and warmth.
This tedious throwaway is a waste of time and talent.
"It's all been seen before. And given that the ending leaves the door wide open for a sequel, it may be seen again. But it shouldn't."
Guns fire. Cars careen. Paintballs hit crotches. Reese Witherspoon bugs her eyes. Chris Pine acts like an ass. Tom Hardy looks disinterested. Repeat. Vomit.
It's easy to see why director Sidney Lumet's clunker ranks as one of the most expensive movie flops of all time.
Silva doesn't make the most of the opportunity he sets up for himself to go to some truly provocative places.
"The experience of watching Molly's Game feels a bit like hearing a long, rambling story from someone high on something, a frantic, exhausting splurge of information that never truly justifies its existence."
"Between Galifianakis' unlikeable travel companion and the film's preposterous series of events, the laughs never really register."
"""Kinsey"" seem like a generic film, which is a hard trick considering the subject matter: sex."
A mildly interesting diversion that is never more than a catchy gimmick in search of a complete story.
A cacophonic waste of talent and time that feels like a slow walk to nowhere&#46; 
"The movie is a hollow throwback to classic comedy, and it shines only by contrast with dull studio competition."
"These are good people and Loving is an important story, but that in itself is not quite enough."
"Trade plays like a slightly more culturally aware episode of Walker, Texas Ranger."
The ingredients for an effective fright flick are here. It simply takes too long to come together.
"Some of his detractors have called Mr. Clark a pornographer, but this is an insult to honest smut-peddlers, who treat their subjects with more respect than he does."
Tends to delve into the ridiculous due to Vin Diesel's incessant comic schtick...makes it hard to take it seriously.
"While the film has its charms and is quite a bit of fun at times, it's also improbable and a step down compared to Shelton's more challenging work."
Can't quite shred the formula that's dragging the plot down.
"Director Mikael Håfström's foot-dragging pace makes a pretense of intent character study, but Michael's spiritual trials are occluded by Michael Petroni's patchy screenplay."
Rogen is far better at directing other performers-or at least performers who are not close friends-than he is at directing himself.
"If you can tolerate a heaping helping of corn, this Texas-bred David-vs-Goliath football saga could be to your taste despite its formulaic bent."
"There's something quaintly charming about the filmmakers' unabashed affection for their inspirational source material, although the sense of over-familiarity means that none of it is in the least bit scary."
"...the film's performances, dialogue, and storyline all [suffer] from an unmistakable vibe of incompetence."
How do I count the ways this movie goes wrong?
We get a gender swap with Henson in the Gibson role. Unfortunately the filmmakers couldn't swap my feelings for the film into enjoying this new version
"Yes, you will get to see Lopez eat chili with her bare hands, but that's only half as disgusting as a close-up on a pregnancy test sinking into a pile of fresh dog vomit."
"With all manner of backstories and flashbacks jamming the road, the Posey-mobile starts to swerve and sputter and finally blows a tire."
Webber's listless direction is as flat as a museum wall.
Zack and Miri isn't very funny. Laugh-out-loud bits here are as rare as real breasts in an adult film.
To say that this is an 'Airplane Movie' would be an insult to Airplane Movies.
"E.B. White's tearful prepubescent semi-classic gets the Happy Hollywood treatment, but with disappointing results."
"At heart, The Believers is a remake of Rosemary's Baby with none of the wit and twice as much gore."
"Be forewarned, if you're depressed about anything before watching this film, you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards."
"In the end, this latest ""Rings"" sequel is just inexcusably bad."
"For all its virtues as a coming-of-age study, it's too slow, too single dimensional to create much of a stir beyond arthouse and hothouse interest. The close-ups of Acquart's classic beauty are well worth the screen time, however."
"RoboCop wants to be about big ideas like identity, the nature of self, man vss technology, security versus freedom, corporate greed that puts profits over people, and all manner of lofty themes. Only the film never actually explores any of them."
"While the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an American movie might demand, Scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a Hollywood production."
"The sequel hasn't been imagined as the next level with which to bring Shrek. It's just more of the same, served a little colder."
"It's really not very striking make-believe, when all is said and done."
"Adams stages the opening speedboat chase with aplomb, but the shootouts are much more formulaic and rely heavily on the laughable inaccuracy of the gang's adversaries and sassy sharpshooter Jenna Kelly's penchant for skimpy outfits."
"It's like a ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch given a lot of money so that they could hire every showbiz pal they have as they tried to fill 107 minutes of screen time."
"Refreshingly, there's nary a cheap scare manifested in this Conjuring, although the unspoken corollary to that is that The Conjuring 2 just isn't very scary, or even unnerving."
"On a scale from Gerard Butler to 10, how bad is Hunter Killer?"
The film is about as appealing as a sexually transmitted disease.
"Morbius is disjointed, rushed, poorly edited, and then it ends abruptly with viewers just kind of staring at their screen wondering what just happened."
"The young cast is terrific, giving the stories unearned weight."
"Features a lot of torture porn in the mold of 'Saw' and 'Hostel,' which hardly constitutes a virtue: that stuff was repulsive at its first appearance, and now has become passé as well."
It's a film without suspense and with a slow-moving story that unfolds without surprise or embellishment.
There is only one thing worse than a bad film. That is a bad film that should have been a great film.
Temple comes off as more of a half-hearted attempt at exploiting typical J-horror themes than an actual homage to the Japanese genre.
"Though better written, better acted and with more wit and subtlety than your average teen flick, the atmosphere in Mean Girls with its promiscuous sex and well, meanness, make it almost as nasty to sit through as these girls are to each other."
"""When You Finish Saving The World"" plays like a melodramatic white dude soap opera without any flavor or believable stakes."
...almost undone by the casting of thoroughly modern Jessica Biel.
This cautionary tale certainly has a chilling and timely message of how wars make monsters out of innocent people.
"Another, more serious problem is that you feel that Mirabelle could do so much better than either Jeremy or Ray. This is also down to the fact that there's an uncomfortable lack of chemistry between [Danes] and either of the two male leads."
This movie hints at a really fascinating story but just barely scratches at its glittery surface.
"Stallone's previous film, Rocky Balboa (2006), was a highly personal and surprisingly touching film. But Rambo shows no such justification for its existence."
"The filmmakers of Long Shot know their way around comedy and romance, but they bit off more than they could chew politics-wise."
"Something deeply unpleasant, and in no way suitable for children."
"As is, ""Summering"" is too scattered and silly for us to really care."
"Director and star excel in this bleak view of a derelict man fighting his past, however the script weighs the film down and leaves us with very little which resonates."
"Ultimately, watching the film becomes a frustrating and annoying experience."
Pity the intelligent moviegoer.
"At the end of the day, nothing particularly spectacular, especially when you consider the two men leading the project, director John Woo and actor Nicolas Cage."
"If you've seen its theatrical trailer then you've seen ""Red Eye."""
This film finds itself in an unfortunate spot in its involuntary thematic and release-date proximity to [The Skeleton Twins].
"Feels stagy, stiff and entirely unnecessary."
"""Welcome to the Rileys"" sets out to be a study of grief and how to overcome it, but it rings too false to offer much hope - or entertainment."
"It's like a feature-length episode of Louie, but without the pathos and unintentionally unfunny."
...a lacking rock-n-roll biopic that has more disjointed disillusionment than a muddy Woodstock hippie.
"A great big beautiful bore, ornately directed by Francis Coppola, with little charm and less meaning."
Hall fail.
"Dark Phoenix was everything that I expected it to be: a bloated, poorly written and executed story with some moments in SPACE."
Landesman has wrangled a murderer's row of character actors here - Tom Sizemore! Ike Barinholtz! Michael C. Hall! Bruce Greenwood! - but his script and direction lack a distinct killer instinct.
"Thoughtful action picture? Meditation on grieving? The Brave One tries to be both but just misses its target, despite the presence of a magnetic Jodie Foster."
"As strong as the music is, there's not much tying Rent together; it's a series of sequences, not a story."
Centered around coincidences so extraordinary they pull me out of the film.
"To the extent that False Confessions does intermittently succeed, it is due almost entirely to [Huppert's] efforts."
"Stevens lends nuance to the role, but the truth is that James is shallow before, during and after his transformation into a ruthless hotshot. This cautionary fable offers far less than meets the eye."
"The longer the case drags on, the more you may begin to wish that, somehow, both sides lose."
"By attempting to say everything about race, Haggis ultimately says nothing."
"Intentions are good in A Good Year, but the sweat is too obvious on the brows of all involved."

"... a clichéd look at redemption and reconciliation, featuring characters who rarely seem grounded in reality."
"Insulting, but that's par for the course with Perry, who can always be counted on to misinterpret his own plots."
Alice never elevates past its high-concept premise. 
"Lacks the proper, skilled stirring of a cinematic chemist to whip all of it into a successful or satisfying yield."
The only sustained funny sequence involves a straight-laced Lowe relaxing at home by casually sipping Scotch and listening to Slayer before doing lines of coke.
The comedy is very hit-and-miss and the action elements are also a mixed bag.
"Some of the action pieces are energetic enough to trick you into thinking there's substance to the story, but it's clear by the second act that this is an empty op."
This rickety Sandler vehicle finds the comedy star steering through a charmless fantasy of self-discovery.
Somewhere deep inside this Gwyneth Paltrow vehicle there is a quality movie with some challenging subject matter. But that promise was glossed over by a film that tries too hard to be nice and not offend its target audience.
"Shrek may have been first, but revisionist fairy tales have become more common than the real thing, and this sequel should have done more to differentiate itself."
"... it tries to be much more meaningful and intelligent than it is, wanting to make sweeping statements about humanity and cruelty but the end only manages to trip over its own contrived, soap opera dramatics."
"So anyway, what happens in Life As We Know It? You'll never guess in a million years. Never."
"[Michael B.] Jordan is good as Kelly, although he seems lost because of the convoluted story that gets away from all concerned."
It's a movie with the atmosphere of a day centre in which the windows are never opened.
"Has a too-many-cooks feel throughout, and coheres only in the final minutes ..."
Ad Astra is a beautiful but boring film. The gorgeous cinematography and captivating score is let down by an uneventful and uninteresting narrative.
"With such an unfocused, impenetrable center, the film grows dull."
"If you found the other two adaptations uninteresting, soulless and overall preposterous, well, Inferno won't be much of an upgrade."
"In The Final Season, high school baseball gives a small town its pride and identity. And quells teenage rebellion. And helps foster two separate romances. And cures cancer."
"The movie is eminently watchable but predictable, pulpy and obviously biased."
"With just a few script tweaks, this long, dull and downright bizarre bore-a-thon could have been more aptly named Uranus Numbing."
Among the startling revelations: Math is precise but life is sloppy.
"[A] satirically unbalanced in its attempted fusion of such varied targets as George Bush, Karl Rove, Dick Cheney, Muslim suicide bombers, and the hosts and contestants on American Idol."
"Amid the bright lights, Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher fail to generate even the faintest of erotic sparks."
"Kosinski was probably so excited about getting the opportunity to attach his name to something he enjoyed as a kid, he forgot that the original film is infantile, a show-off for early CGI, and that trying to take infantilism seriously is a major mistake."
Hysterically overwrought.
That sound you hear is the bubble getting near to bursting.
...a fairly excruciating way to spend an evening.
"Occasional thrills can't save plodding, messy sequel."
The heart of James Redford's documentary about toxic stress and its affect on physical health is in the right place but the execution never rises above the pedestrian.
No matter how much insight we eventually gain into Tom and Kaisa one must ask exactly who would want to gain insight into these people.
It falls flat trying to muster up any mirth or suspense as it barrels from one set piece to the next.
"At the Ready, while palatable, has little appetite for contesting or provoking debate."
"It's almost as if ""Short Term 12"" was a fluke - ""The Glass Castle"" has none of the dynamic vibrancy and revealing, emotional intelligence of Destin Daniel Cretton's winning sophomore effort."
[A] vile mess.
A film at odds with itself.
"Persistent sentimentality - manifested most in the music score by A.R. Rahman - undercuts ""Beyond the Clouds"" at almost every turn."
"This lonesome cowpoke story has its moments of visual beauty, but fails to capture the magic of the first Wenders-Shepard collaboration, 1984's intimate Western Paris, Texas."
"The big-eyed Ms. Padukone, who has co-starred with Mr. Kapoor before, dutifully, and regrettably, permits him to eclipse her own formidable charisma."
"There were a few laughs to be had, but this is really TV sitcom material and not drama of great wit."
"Despite a breezy premise, this rom-com displays lazy filmmaking at almost every level of the production"
"It doesn't bring anything new to the table. And its pacing, grim tone, and cheesy guitar riffs belong squarely in the '80s."
The audience is clearly being steered to taking Fred's side even when Charlotte is the only one with anything to lose.
This plays like an early George Romero shocker but without Romero's humor or social commentary.
Can this be done in a way that is not stupefyingly generic?
[A] tediously naturalistic and fairly pointless no-budget indie about the compromises of middle-aged femininity.
Calling it snail-paced would be insulting to snails.
"If what audiences are looking for is a thrill ride, or even a pervasive eeriness, The Happening's just not happening."
Not even the august presence of Maximilian Schell can dispel the odor of fusty smut that clings to House of the Sleeping Beauties.
"It’s known that crocodiles can slow their heart rate to stay underwater for long periods of time, but it’s hard to feel any heart beating here at all."
If you see only one Jewish demonic possession movie this year...
Luis Mandoki's movie Trapped is one of the most inept hostage thrillers I've ever seen.
An unqualified disaster...
Narcissistic comedians stylistically masturbating.
The ultimate target audience will undoubtedly have the added benefit of libations.
"Passengers goes from having a clever premise to an unethical one that romanticizes stalking in a Stockholm Syndrome love story, and somehow the ending is even worse than everything that comes before it."
"Anderson (Resident Evil, Event Horizon, Mortal Kombat) has a thing for gamelike killing sprees. What he doesn't have is talent."
"The two talented stars both have enough inner light to almost convince us that what's going on matters, but they are stymied by the fact that their performances are geared to a tragedy the movie fails to fulfill."
"likeable, but limited"
"FANTASY ISLAND is admirably ambitious, but ambition can only take a convoluted storyline and mixed performances so far."
"It is hard not to immediately draw comparisons to Outlaw King due to the films' proximities. However, when the former is markedly stronger in terms of scripting, acting, and entertainment quality, it does Robert the Bruce no favours."
"Think Overboard with masturbating, asphyxiated teens, gun-toting/weed-smoking priests, lesbian high school teachers preying on her students, a parade of wasted talent, and Bow Wow."
"With its dulling straightforward pitch for Jesus, The Last Sin Eater seems like the worst of films from a non-born-again perspective."
"Young children will be entertained, but for the rest of the audience, pretty colors just aren't enough."
A lazy and uninteresting film badly in need of a few new ideas in front of the camera and a lot more behind it.
A loser...one date you'd be wise to turn down.
"Byrum's lackluster, ambling script and Bruce Paltrow's unimaginative reading of it routinely stand at cross-purposes with a first-class cast."
"This might have been a more powerful story, and certainly a more relatable one, had Mitchell been a working class stiff who didn't have the privileged option to simply cease going to work."
"The Scheme relies heavily on interviews with journalists who actually did the investigative work that's used in the movie, but the filmmakers chose not to do their own further investigations."
"Oscar Wilde's classic novel is turned into a schlock horror movie, totally engulfed by gloomy atmosphere and over-the-top filmmaking. It's watchably cheesy, but completely lacks Wilde's incisive wit or observation."
"Lili, in turn, deserves better than the pretty, pastel treatment [Tom] Hooper has applied to her life."
Whenever the bear is on screen&#44; it rocks&#46; Often hilarious &amp; increasingly gory the further it goes&#46;  The rest of the time&#44; it sucks&#46; Best seen with a huge crowd&#44; but for as wildly ridiculous &amp; fun as the concept is&#44; has a lot of unrealized potential&#46;
"[Its] first fifty minutes are so tacky, so leaden, and so aimless that all the floor care intrigue in the world can't save it."

"This isn't a movie, it's a business deal set to music."
"Welcome to the plot of every underdog romantic comedy ever -- there are indeed some good laughs, but the story here is negligible."
"The whole thing makes Winter's Bone look as cheerful as a Li'l Abner strip, and there's something distastefully condescending about it."
"This kiddie version of the old tale of unlikely Broadway triumph is pleasant enough, but it doesnt merit a prolonged curtain call."
"Not completely horrible, but fails to live up to the silliness its title promises."
"The radiating charisma and talent from Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron come very, very close to saving Baywatch"
"""The Mortal Instruments"" franchise is strictly for the initiated. They will no doubt love it. Everyone else will be flummoxed."
This adventure drama about a group trying to survive in the Gobi desert is filled with nothing but hot air.
"Clockstoppers has nothing to offer but its one meager technological trick, and before you know it, the trick disappears."
"The action scenes are still good, but the comedy itself is very slight."
There&#8217;s little reason for anyone outside of blindly devoted fans to seek it out&#46;
Penn's film doesn't entertain greatly nor does it have much coherent to say.
Settles disappointingly for rom-com cliches. It doesn't even bother to explore its own premise.
Destined to become a VOD-dare for the kind of movie-watcher who likes to smell a carton of spoiled milk out of curiosity.
Everything explodes into a massive ball of flames for no reason at all. And this overblown fakery makes it impossible to buy into the film at any level.
"As a fellow viewer noted, Queen Bees provides sweet, sometimes touching, entertainment. Yet the movie doesn't invite a second viewing."
This is one of those discomfiting films where you don't know whether to laugh or cry - Alice is self-obsessed and a bit unlikable too - and just end up feeling uncomfortable instead.
"Fake punk-rock has its own visual language, and the opening minutes of Stick It--movie about that most punk-rock of sports, gymnastics--piles on the ""Do The Dew"" clichés"
"Has style to spare, but none of the novel's shock value"
Filmmaker-y posturing on the part of first-time writer-director Jieho Lee interferes with the clarity of his interwoven stories in The Air I Breathe.
It's all terribly self-conscious and desperately arty and fairly bad.
"The latest Ben-Hur remake plods along, which is odd since it is is at least an hour-and-a-half shorter than the very long 1959 version."
It wants to be both a cynical reimagining of 'To Kill A Mockingbird' and a Coen Bros' black comedy.
Mission to Mars is neither commercial nor intriguingly indulgent.
"A cynical, perfunctorily directed, guileless, sexless and artless re-tread of the novel - the worst kind of fan, and potential franchise, service."
Your children deserve better.
"Democracy dies in darkness, sure, but if Spielberg really wanted to make a movie about the fate of journalism in America, he should have made one about the founding of USA Today in 1982."
The film has a desperately cutesy-pie charm that drips with flop sweat.
The plot sticks relentlessly to the most reductive version of the 'hero's journey' formula.
"If you're familiar with the concept of hate-watching or ironically loving a movie, then by all means, enjoy ripping Winter's Tale to shreds with your friends at the bar next door."
"The film's aim -- to dazzle and inspire -- is sapped by Cruise's vein-popping, running-the-marathon performance."
There's a lot to admire in the innovative cinematic construction of American Splendor but not much to like unless you're a fan of the autobiographical comics on which it is based.
Clumsily pitched and presented!
The original film's mix of romanticized innocence and sexual adventure has been replaced by after-school- special plot twists and puppy-love handholding.
"Not only is it an illogical, nastily violent affair full of stock characters and slasher-movie tactics, but it's a sequel to a movie that absolutely needed no sequel in the first place."
Snyder likes to think that his Russian nesting doll of a concept is enough to excuse its hollow center.
"Deuces Wild treads heavily into Romeo and Juliet/West Side Story territory, where it plainly has no business going."
"Designed for hardcore cineastes who will delight at all the name dropping, Mank has its moments but its lack of pace and air of self-congratulation make it a contender for one of the most overrated films of 2020."
"Movie adaptations shouldn't require that you know their source material. But in the case of ""The Glass Castle,"" it's impossible not to just say it: You're better off reading the book."
Offensively bad? No. But it's never been anything more than a promising wasted opportunity.
"Haven't we seen this somewhere before? We have: the infinitely superior ""Madame Rosa."""
There's probably more scenes in slow motion in Bad Moms than in The Matrix.
As formulaic as it sounds.
"A bizarrely misguided attempt to revive -- and spoof -- the classic B-movie, Super Capers is the kind of experience that makes you want your 93 minutes back."
"The movie is close to a guilty pleasure but it is also a very silly, crummily-scripted mess with no idea how to get from one sequence to the next in that way they call... storytelling?"
"This is Jackman's show entirely, and he's as forceful and charismatic as ever as the walking, talking hurt that is Wolverine. If only he had something more interesting to do here."
The dysfunctional family in this film is little more than a shameless plot device to introduce a lame father/son bonding adventure.
A movie that's completely out of its tree.
"There are several uniquely impressive elements to the adventure drama ""Mia and the White Lion,"" but they're undermined by a choppy, at times contrived and implausible script by Prune de Maistre and William Davies."
A joyless lesson in overstaying one's welcome. Everything about this movie is marked down like a fire sale. The visuals look shoddy and the uninspired script is a dud that requires no effort by the young cast.
They could've cut 10 minutes out of the first hour easily...and it still might have been too slow.
Less a proper coming-of-age movie than a posh version of Home And Away.
Bland and flavorless.
"Barrymore is actually becoming quite the deft physical comedienne, unafraid to make herself look unsightly for effect. But her performance isn't enough to overcome even one of the other problems."
"What worked for Free Guy doesn’t sustain itself here, largely because you can’t really have two Deadpools in a scene without giving yourself a headache."
The truest thing to say about Miami Vice is that it's an OK picture with some superb things in it.
"Despite Ricky Gervais' unique comic talents, this David Brent rock star adventure soon becomes too repetitive."
A hollow movie hiding behind great actors and decent production values. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Speaking of ""dead"" ... let's talk about this series."
A progressively underwhelming sequel...
"We begin the film not knowing what brought Michael and James together. We end, after a too-long 98 minutes, precisely the same way."
"Engagement with the audience is relegated mostly to nods and winks, with a chuckle here and there, rather than crafting a thought-provoking story with compelling characters."
The lifeless music and dance sequences in which the rapper performs with his crew have the feel of low-budget video clips that have been inserted almost by mistake.
This is solid proof that dynamic sports footage does not make an effective crime thriller.
"doesn't just violate the audience's right to entertainment, it violates animal dignity to such an extent that PETA might want to consider getting involved"
It looks the part of a great heist movie but doesn't compare to those that that truly are.
Who would have thought Sam Raimi could have made a film in which the dead are harmless&#44; even helpful&#63;
"Comedy, tragedy, horror, fantasy, romance... all of this is part of Victor Frankenstein, and yet it feels like it lacks all of that. That's bad. [Full review in Spanish]"
"As a bit of cheesy Asian cinema, it works, but it didn't quite translate into a western without looking a bit like a Jonah Hex sequel."
The Aeronauts begs the question of what use is a historical biopic if the history is so dramatized it is barely recognizable to actual history.
[Dahl's] been beaten down either by the idiot script or the idiot moneymen or both.
A chance for the stay-at-home world-travelers to catch sight of Johannesburg's filthy sprawling township of Soweto.
"It lacks originality, it lacks creativity, and most of all it lacks a good script."
"As a narrative piece it simply has too many problems. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, Sex, Nudity, etc. - also Available)"
It's a real bummer because if they had kept the strange tone of the early scenes I could have had a surprise hit.
"Chock-full of obnoxious dialogue, terrible acting, and oh-so-clever product placement."
"In its aim to tamp down Eisenberg's neuroticism and have him offer slow drips of revelation rather than bursts of loquacious energy, Night Moves keeps too much hidden from view."
A terminally cynical movie that tries to pass off lamebrained sadism as edgy comedy. Please — there is not enough edge here to cut through a fruitcake.
The first big failure of Marvel's Phase 3
"Counting Roger Corman's unreleased stab, this is the fourth Fantastic Four movie. It's also the fourth whose producers seem embarrassed at the thought of making a Fantastic Four movie."
"If you decide to go see ""Tooth Fairy,"" you're going to get pretty much what you deserve, but in the overall scheme of things, there are a few puffs of laughing gas delivered with the anesthesia here."
"Unfortunately, Lost Bayou isn't going to end up on a list of classic New Orleans movies or even classic supernatural movies."
An unintentionally ludicrous drama of repentance as an extreme sport.
"The 2019 version of The Lion King is an apex of faux-live-action animation, with an impressive volume of photorealistic effects. It may be the dullest technological game-changer ever made."
The script is anachronistic and trite ...
"Kalin is a very brave and honest filmmaker (and plenty astute), but his subject matter argues that some stories need not be told."
"Similar to the movie adaptation of Philip Pullman's The Golden Compass (Knopf, 1996), the filmmakers shoehorn most of the book's plot into a small amount of time, leaving little room for character development or nuanced acting."
Even James Bond proved something of a dud in the final iteration of Daniel Craig's run as the British super spy.
"Too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good, it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing."
A pale imitation of its fresh and frisky predecessor.
"Coppola is brilliant at capturing mood: With cinematographer Harris Savides, her languid camera depicts California melancholy. But substance isn't her game."
"The Ant Bully, in trying to match Antz or A Bug's Life, just digs itself into a big hole."
Feels less like a showcase for its star than just another glossy barrier holding back her potential.
"The cacophony of visions, broken mirrors, and mutilations only points to the ghost in the machine respecting The Craft as its spirit animal."
A frothy motion picture that offers moments of guilty pleasure but isn't good enough to earn a recommendation.
"It's not ""The Sure Thing"" -- it's not even ""Never Been Thawed"" -- but it's probably about as well made as a movie called ""Sex Drive"" has any right to be."
Fatally confuses crassness with subversion.
The waste of talent -- especially of two comic veterans -- is occasionally sad to watch.
"Unfortunately, Blackhat proves to be worthier of January's taint than of Mann's good name."
Where are the Knights Who Say 'Ni!' when we need them?
"Hancock and Fusco want their protagonists to be the good guys so badly that they have rigged the game, creating a world were everything they do becomes right by virtue of having been done by them."
"So, Christmas comes twice this year? Or is that just Santa?"
"It's a sardonic, subversive, heavy-handed black comedy, painting a nasty picture."
A weak film that will disappear from the cinema radar in near record time.
I didn't like this film so much. I'm giving it thumbs down.
"Gyllenhaal can, in fact, act, so the blame must fall elsewhere for his dim performance, all topless tears and soulful voiceovers. The same goes for Peter Sarsgaard, Chris Cooper and Jamie Foxx, three good actors forced into contortions of theatrics."
"I realize that watching a 20-something hipster have a quarter life meltdown for two hours might be entertaining for some, but I still cannot get into it."
"Ring Two goes far enough into dementia that (if you can stick with it that long), you may wish it would suck it up and go the full mile."
"A handful of domestic scenes prove that the actors, not to mention Hank, would've been much better served by a ballsier script and braver direction."
A strong sense of boredom-inducing familiarity permeates Slender Man despite its best efforts to texture the central characters' friendships and infuse relevance via a clumsy emphasis on social media and cellphone culture.
"What we get is essentially the press-book version of their careers, which is harrowing enough."
The kind of thriller that skitters after its star playing catch-up.
"This film looks so good, and has such a strong cast, that some viewers won't notice how corny the script is."
"A failed film, in which the actions of the characters seem to come from the director's indications, not from a real nucleus of conflict. [Full review in Spanish]"
Henson's imagination is boundless. But his movie has no pep. It's a dream in neutral.
"Like the TV series before it, Looking: The Movie is pointless and boring."
"Quarantine is symptomatic of a broken industry; one that would rather remake a perfectly good foreign language film with nice, safe, recognisable American faces rather than plough any money into original concepts."
We get a final sense that the experience of making it was probably more rewarding &#46;&#46;&#46; for the filmmaker than the experience of watching it is for us&#46;
"While the plot is well-worn and somewhat clumsily put together, the fine performance of Shannon as the main character powers the movie along pretty well until the film stumbles to its predictable conclusion."
"The romance ... becomes more obvious as the story and relationship progress ... So, too, does the complication of the husbands, each of whose presence feels increasingly unnecessary..."
"If Broomfield hoped to shed some light on what happened at Haditha beyond our worst preconceptions, he's failed."
"At about two hours and 20 minutes, ""Robin Hood"" is heavy on exposition and dialogue and short on action. There seems to be a lot of dead space in which nothing happens. The movie could very easily have been trimmed to two hours or less."
Assassin's Creed is easily the worst movie Fassbender and Cotillard have ever participated in.
The raunch itself may be enough for a teen audience. But The To Do List is no American Pie.
"After that promising start, Collateral ratchets down, gradually, to being only average."
Annaud and screenwriter Becky Johnston's view of the Tibetans isn't much more sophisticated than James Hilton's depiction of the inhabitants of Shangri-La in 'Lost Horizon': They're mostly serene mystics...
Stay home and play the game instead.
High expectations but low delivery; one of the major disappointments of the year
muddled in the monotonous
"Like the previous Simpson-Bruckheimer pictures, it's designed to give audiences an overdose of the thrill of victory; it wants us to jump out of our seats, pumping our fists in the air and roaring for the hero to pulverize his opponents."
"It seems like a huge waste of time to have this much access to Glass, but come up with little more than a fan page."
An earnest puddle of slop.
Adds star power but unfortunately downshifts the craziness to dive into full Hallmark Channel schmaltz.
"Instead of trying to find balance, the filmmaker could have stuck with the spirit of the book, which already has a legion of fans...while you're dazzled by the stunning visual effects, you don't really connect with the characters."
"If [James] Bobin and company had reigned things in and kept a tighter focus on one, not three, plots...but they did not."
"Without going back over my notes, the flick has already begun to slip from my consciousness and undoubtedly will soon meld with any number of other wedding-based films from the past few decades. (Complete Content Details for Parents also available)"
"With such an impressive opening, The Rite isn't a complete failure. However, I have to admit, toward the end of this movie, I was rooting for the Devil to win."
You often don't think about why you root for a film's protagonist. It therefore becomes very glaring when this intrinsic emotional attachment doesn't exist.
The sweetly surreal feeling of those original books has been lost. What always felt like an English garden party gone slightly off has been replaced by the grotesque and the Gothic and the overdone.

Pollack appears to have taken lessons from Martin Brest about how to irritate and bore viewers with endless pauses in conversations.
"Very silly: sometimes almost enjoyably so, often just in a tired way."
Harold Ramis's 1999 hit Analyze This was filled with chuckles and sitcom appeal; this sequel is charmless and sour.
Fashioned with all the objectivity and insight of a promotional special on NBA TV.
Unfortunately plays out more like Student Video 101.
"The Mountain Between Us almost has a hypnotizing quality to it, with so many impressive parts operating within a machine that doesn't really doesn't function properly."
The script is based on the cliche of the thieves from obscure pasts and opposing personalities. [Full review in Spanish]
As a book&#44; Luckiest Girl Alive was frequently compared to Gone Girl&#46; The same isn&#8217;t likely to happen with the movie version&#44; evidencing the difference a strong adaptation and director can make&#46;
"The direction drags, the performances are uneven and there's a strong sense that the fictionalised story is less interesting than the reality."
"While the jumbled time-loops and neo-nuclear family gags make for some initial reboot fun, Genisys soon becomes little more than an overblown karaoke rehash of the sci-fi riffs of yesteryear."
An excruciating misfire.
Director Marc Webb seems to have made The Amazing Spider-Man because ... he was hired.
"There is some comic insight here, however unfocused it may be."
"Unnecessary second-shot Mechanic: Resurrection, playing like a third-rate remake of Bond scenes, can't resurrect the ghost of a thrilling action sequence, the spirit of a high-calibre assassin adventure, even the faintest whiff of originality."
"A by-the-numbers, old-fashioned thriller with at least two huge plot holes."
"Brown's saga, like many before his, makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie."
"It's hard to put a finger on what exactly this film is, and, for a while, it seems as if the filmmakers aren't sure what they're after, either."
Two camels substitute for Fonzie's shark in this franchise-ending sequel
...the film has been infused with a myriad of shamelessly over-the-top elements that inevitably become quite tough to take.
...a handsome-looking but entirely empty comic-book adaptation.
"Speed 2 suffers from a slender script, a tedious first reel and a routine villain who lacks the entertaining menace that Speed's diabolical madman projected."
"Like Rashomon by way of Law & Order: Medieval SVU, The Last Duel should be remembered most for finally giving Matt Damon and Ben Affleck the haircuts their personalities have long demanded."
"It's a lazy, watered down gangster flick that is not nearly as clever or as new as it attempts to be."
"Clarkson deftly delivers her character's withering lines and Spall convincingly dangles at the end of his character's rope, but The Party passes without arriving at a consequential destination."
A horror flick for young fans who aren't quite prepared for the really scary stuff.
"She's the One isn't slick, smooth or particularly good, and it offers only a perfunctory exploration of the human heart."
... Michael Caine is badly miscast in this movie. I didn't believe him for one second in that role.
"Although adults will find it barely entertaining (even with one rather inappropriate Marilyn Monroe allusion), children will love the little blue folks..."
lacks something all good movies need - A FREAKING PLOT!
"Whatever allegory of pre-feminist roles that Reichardt hopes to achieve is slowly put to sleep along with the rest of the audience with a less-is-less narrative style that, like Meek, is too stubborn to realize how lost it is."
A perfectly sorry excuse for a horror film.
"Fantastic Four isn't a movie. It's just a thing - pun intended, because we must find amusement somewhere - that happens for 100 minutes."
"Written with more bite, the premise might hold up, but as executed here by Tolan, it is a soft-hearted, haphazard mess."
The revelations will be&#44; in order&#58; underwritten&#44; silly&#44; vaguely offensive and unsatisfying&#46;
So-so Price horror offering
It's repetitive mayhem as usual.
Marred with long stretches of the pothole most anathemic to comedy: dead air.
"This insipid, horror, fantasy spoof featuring rock star Dave Grohl and his Foo Fighter band members is an inane and lazy film that squanders the groups goodwill."
Adolescent boys will savour My Way's bombast and solemnity. Cringing adult audiences will more likely beat a retreat before final call.
"With tons of rushing water, expert stunt work and superb integration of digital awesomeness, Petersen keeps the ride that is Poseidon chugging right along. But like most sinking ships, it's a story about a trip to nowhere."
"The peculiar, comic-book-like computer graphics -- artful at first -- finally overtake Blood and make it look like a video game instead of a graceful, graphic martial arts movie."
The mediocrity on display is exhausting.
"Ultimately, the film's ambitions of inclusivity, both in its story and its casting, are more admirable than the execution."
"Scene by scene, Jindabyne has dramatic force, but it's an awfully long slog. Carver's smartest tactic was never outstaying his welcome."
"Jiu Jitsu has all the barely-motivated action and sci-fi trappings of a middling videogame and, well, at least a little of the dramatic value."
Doesn't add up to much beyond a great set of conceits.
The layers of dry wit that are supposed to engage the grownups don't work ...
"Not quite bad enough to call rancid, and that's the best I can say for it."
The film unfortunately pulls back from its social interrogation just when it's working up a head of steam.
This is one loooooooonnnng mother-in-law joke.
"Despite some lovely scenes of foxes doing their thing, the whole affair is ruined by the interfering and rather annoying humans."
Not likely to please anyone.
Big props to Will Smith for doing the best he could with what he had to work with. I still love him as an actor. But Gemini Man was a bust.
A glossy amalgamation of much better action-adventure fare&#46;
Run All Night hardly bores... But the all-important details don't add up here.
...most notable for the inventive new touches added which prove amusing diversions to the dull central throughline...It's kind of like the movie equivalent of a toddler's busy box.

"""Green Lantern"" isn't ""Jonah Hex"" bad. But it's silly enough to be part of the same ""silliest Warner Brothers comic book summer movies of all time"" conversation."
"Wolf Creek 2 does all it can to paper over the fact that it shouldn't exist, but the film severely diminishes the integrity of the first Wolf Creek by turning Mick into a cartoon icon, more Outback legend than man."
"Imagine Babe without the heart, acting, writing, direction, craftsmanship, appeal, respect, scoring, wonder, and general storybook feel. That's Racing Stripes."
"After three successful cinematic renditions of Jack Finney's 1955 sci-fi novel ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (the 1978 version with Donald Sutherland being my favourite), they've finally managed to mangle it up."
"This romantic comedy redefines the low-end of its genre, with a stale, predictable plot, 100 per cent fizzling jokes, awful acting and a sit-com quality production."
A movie that feels like a feature-length commercial for the hotel.
"Every bit as cliched, amateurish and feeble as its predecessors."
"Like its lead character, About a Boy exists in a stale vacuum of time-killing routine."
"""Dot the I"" wants to join the ranks of ""Memento"" and ""The Usual Suspects,"" films that reward multiple viewings, but it's so ridiculous that it doesn't sustain a first."
"The film is made with skill and flair, but the story remains essentially a yarn, and in that context its grimness is exhaustingly hard to take."
"Piven is saddled with a lame backstory about a former partner's tragic death, something about a lost son, a thoroughly forced romantic subplot, and a series of awful and increasingly desperate stabs at raunchy humor."
"So, what's next? A movie about April Fool's Day?"
"Angel seems like a collection of misjudgements that required much effort, but with little satisfaction for that effort"
"Had Scott shown more faith in his film's own complexity, he might have made something great."
There's a fair amount of material in The Little Vampire that younger kids might find quite disturbing.
"For all the visual wizardry at work on screen in Robert Zemeckis' ""Beowulf,"" it's a wonder I found myself leaving the theater feeling lifeless and unenthusiastic."
"[Richard] Linklater is trying to rook us all into believing this is a universally heartwarming scenario. The unfathomably wealthy can be heroes, he says. That is, until the peasants sack the White Palace that Bernadette designed."
"Any chance to catch this crew on the screen is worth treasuring, even in a middling comedy that's been shelved several times since it was filmed three years ago."
"If I thought for a minute this Roquefort-riddled camp-fest was as intentionally ridiculous, stilted, witless and over-the-top as it actually is, I'd congratulate Boll."
"A pummeling, two hour and 45 minute assault that essentially dares the audience to keep track of what's happening."
"To Rome with Love desperately needs a script polish, as well as an entire third act."
"No new ideas, and runs out of old ones fast."
"Once you get over the novelty of watching mixed martial arts fighter Gina Carano beat up her male co-stars, the film has practically nothing else to offer."
"What we are left with is an efficient period drama that never quite justifies its own running time of a shade under two hours, or our viewing time."
"At almost two hours, the film feels every minute of it, building to a climax that basically amounts to the platitude ""being a father is really hard."""
"They require a bigger stage, a sharper script and a more rigorous director. Without these, the long-awaited De Niro/Pacino show amounts to nothing so much as a novelty bout, a celebrity sparring session. Its sound and fury signifies very little."
"Deficient in the comedy of reticence discouragement that is Aardman's (or maybe just Nick Park's) unique strength. I don't want to say the Englishmen were corrupted, but I think they allowed their strongest, quirkiest instincts to be tethered."
"BloodRayne is a visual joke, with Boll limply organizing a period horror/action film with all the confidence and subtlety of Baby Huey, and with about the same level of literacy."
[I]t's pretty clear that Hot Tub Machine 2 is running on creative fumes...
"It's handsome, important, and moving in places, but it just isn't enough movie for the subject matter."
"Perhaps the movie should have been called ""Four Bridesmaids and a Hookah."""
"It's an endurance test that ends in moans of recognition as characters seem to be acting out scenes from other, better movies. Really, you don't want to sit through this."
Excellent turns cannot make this plodding package any more of a bludgeoning chore to sit through.
"One confused picture, endeavoring to find pockets of dramatic depth as it organizes a big screen bloodbath."
"It advances important and laudable ideas, but in a cliched, gimmicky way."
Amateur Hour-and-a-Half....It isn't fit for human consumption.
"Taking many liberties with what it includes and omits about the Unabombers biography, Ted K more damningly reduces the viewers perception of its subject to easy caricature, borne out of a materialist conception of ideological interiority."
... a deeply unironic and mildly gross Blanchett showreel.
"Jakob is a self-serious villain and the film treats him seriously too, unlike F9's self-aware and fun-laden approach elsewhere. It's just not the right move. Look to The Suicide Squad and how James Gunn makes better use of [John] Cena."
A film whose only distinguishing characteristic is how big a mess it makes of its already meager ambitions.
The film stands only as one more step to Endgame and nothing more. [Full Review in Spanish]
"They wanted to cover too many things, and in some cases they have stayed halfway. [Full Review in Spanish]"
An under-cooked comedy about the food business.
The film teases with a few moments of pep and reality until devolving precipitously into clumsy exposition and preposterous melodrama.
There are no ideas to engage with and no one to like.
So shallow and silly that it makes reading The Nation seem like the deepest kind of bliss.
"Screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg continues her long tradition of scripting staggeringly banal, subtext-free dialogue and grasping at the profundity of her betters by quoting poetry in the prologues."
"The lead actors are good, and the film moves along so well that audiences may overlook plot holes that are, well, waist deep."
This is one time when (with apologies to Herman's Hermits and that jolly Henry VIII) the second verse -- multi or otherwise -- is not the same as the first.
Rates a solid C.
"I hated it, but I grant that it does tap into a vein of technological horror -- the fear of the VCR! -- that will have young videophiles chatting it up for weeks."
"Means well, but it's as bland as a stale slice of dry white bread."
"What to do with this light, while it lasts? [Director] Wagner's problem is to find an answer to that question and also to offer some resolution to the conflicts of honesty and compromise the movie portrays."
"It's hard to believe that so much visual elegance has been brought to bear on material so ugly, and yet the disjunction is intentional, and the film is all of a piece."
...Riddled with bizarre contrivances and unlikely scenarios.
"It's inoffensive and shiny and competent and kids will dig it, and I can already barely remember a single thing that happened."
"The message is unclear, unless it's to think twice before ordering chips in Lima."
"This is a badly rendered CGI wasteland that has no sense of fun or adventure, and wallows in its own mediocrity."
That The Longest Yard is considered something of a classic is baffling...
"Otherwise, waving off the dullness of 'The Bye Bye Man' is the only satisfaction that warrants one's indifference to this piece of faceless slasher sludge."
"At its best, 7500 is Captain Phillips light. The problem is that it's rarely at its best."
Die-hard fans may be pleased.
"Nicolas Roeg's obfuscating style tricks it up, though the film is ultimately an empty thing."
"The answers Garcia offers aren't necessarily satisfying; particularly for those who believe in adoption or (gasp) childlessness, but they are thought-provoking questions nevertheless."
"It's got over-the-top sequences to spare, yet Those Who Wish Me Dead never connects on a fundamental level."
"The film quickly spirals into unstructured, nearly laughable chaos."
"""Vivo"" takes off with a cute kinkajou, some good music and some interesting visuals, but ultimately doesn't stick the landing."
"This is a particularly toxic little bonbon, palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few."
"Wrapping a history lesson in a romantic melodrama can make for a lively movie, but only if the love story is juicier than the educational narrative."
It doesn't help that the film eventually loses its focus and has to fumble back to the real storyline at the very end.
One potential victim verbally acknowledges the obvious similarity of their predicament to Ten Little Indians; it's the first of several self-conscious blunders this movie makes as it seeks to escape its B-picture constraints.
The movie is wispy and meandering; it doesn't gather power as it goes along.
"A sad, sorry film that could very well come to represent the absolute nadir of its genre."
"Zac Efron is Tom Cruise-lite. Beyond the blue eyes and man-scaped stubble, you are left with an actor who simply pauses on screen when he is not speaking."
"The only thing that saves it from being total trash is the skill of the lead actors, who make the best out of nothing."
It's not the worst two hours of entertainment (especially with mute and pause buttons near at hand). But it's not the next Wreck-It Ralph.
'One Day' Drags on for an Eternity
The story comes to feel mild (and incomplete) in its tempered nostalgia.
"The screenplay spends all of its time borrowing from the source material, and nothing from the human brain."
"The macho showmanship of director Fyodor Bondarchuk, wedded to such a facile script, turns this undeniably impressive megaproduction into a behemoth you mainly want to cower from."
"Nonsensical Danish thriller concocts absurd connections between the nature of evil and *checks notes* office politics among shallow clichés of women. Preposterously, this is not meant to be satire."
!@#&*! Sam Arkoff must be screaming 'I told you so' from a !@#&*!mountaintop -- because it took Hollywood 35 !@#&*! years to discover what he knew all along.
"...all bark and no bite, the behind the scenes machinations of a hugely influential magazine used as mere window dressing for an uninspired romantic comedy."
"White and writer Abdul Williams are determined to squeeze in some social commentary. And while this, too, is mostly familiar stuff, a couple of bits do resonate."
Insidious 2 seems like it's one of those films that Wan made more for the studio than for himself.
"Apparently in movie time, 23 years lasts only as long as it takes to see if the original makes enough money to justify doing another - too bad."
Has little charm and not nearly enough big laughs to sustain its withering plot and quick 85-minute running time.
It's not just the way it crawls under your skin with its paean to one misguided woman's self-involvement; it's also the idea that a nation of social media addicts would find this rambling crime spree of any importance.
"Madea's Big Happy Family plods from one scene to the next at a deliberate pace, repeatedly betraying its theatrical roots as each new conversation or confrontation plays out like the latest in a series of segments in a stage revue."
One hundred and nine minutes of drama and not a single moment rings true.
It is certainly Witherspoon's best performance since Line... But her performance can't deliver the emotional punch the film requires
"A 20-minute calling card short extended to a tolerance-stretching 74 minutes, this is an effectively directed but ultimately pointless wind-up exercise."
The main problem of this film is that the base material is so ridiculous and unconvincing. [Full review in Spanish]
Motion-capture animation takes a giant step backwards with this unappealing outer-space adventure.
"A movie by, for and about the Attention Deficit Disordered."
A grab bag of bits from the whole demons-and-angels spectrum.
It seems to miss the mark in terms of who it thinks its audience will be. It's not silly enough for the 8-year-old audience or smart-aleck enough for tweens.
You have to know the video game to really get it and I did not know the video game.
"For a good while, it works. But when Wain's mental health declines, the film has no insights to offer; it simply loses shape."
Next month someone will put out a brand-new gross-out Guy Flick that erases I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell's last shred of relevance. But you and I won't see it. And Tucker Max will finally become a corporate attorney for small-arms manufacturers.
"Sunshine Cleaning has that ""Sundance"" vibe, in that it feels overly developed and tested for a bittersweet 'indie"" feel and for maximum quirkiness."
...the natural performances here just feel wrong for the material. Campier performances or juicier violence would have made this an easier pill for me to swallow.
"The bones of what made the new era of the saga exciting -- the talented, appealing actors, the charming practical effects and creatures -- are still there, but it's all mired in a plot that's as sludgy as planet Dagobah."
"It's silly teenage ""Revenge of the Nerds"" fun. And it's spirited."
"My Bloody Valentine has lously gender politics for a slasher movie, and that's both disappointing and disconcerting because the film has probably made enough money to merit a sequel and inspire other 3D horror movies."
"Unfortunately, this playful yet serious and occasionally quite moving drama bites off far more than it can chew."
"Kidman's performance keeps you transfixed all the way through, because she delves into her character's damaged psyche so fully, you're constantly fascinated to see what biting, acidic thing she will say next."
"If the personal story works better, though, it's partly to default: As a political thriller, Gardener has a few holes."
The point is that You Should Have Left is precisely what you'll be telling yourself if you make the terrible mistake of watching this nothing-burger of a movie.
"Neither as dreadful as some would claim nor as poignant as it would like to be, Diana skirts the surface of a complex figure while trying to keep all parties at bay."
"Like most April Fools' Day jokes, Morbius is not actually funny. It’s not bad in the ha ha you have to see this it’s so ridiculous kind of way. It just feels underbaked and lame -- and, sadly, not weird enough to be any kind of fun."

"This 2005 feature offered me my first taste of Guy Ritchie's macho-centric artiness, and I hope it's my last."
The mannered approach&#44; while artistically defensible in terms of creating in the viewer some sense of both the disorientation the girls experienced and the inability of outsiders to understand them&#44; nonetheless leaves &#91;it&#93; more affected than affecting&#46;
"With Eternals, Marvel proves itself to be nothing more than a staid, lumbering black hole."
"Nichols has allowed Wolf to evolve from a well-mounted, supernatural drama to goofy camp."
The Change-Up thinks any ol' R-rated gag will make us howl.

"The results are oddly more artificial than the 1932 original, and considerably less moving."
We're not talking Star Wars here; we're instead talking Disney-like cute.
"What's in the film other than what you might have seen on TV? Yes, it's in 3D, which adds nothing and dims the picture."
Prince-Bythewood makes a clunky transition to action filmmaking with a visually shoddy and narratively predicable work that wastes the talents of a gifted ensemble.
Shue comes perilously close to offensive caricature as the afflicted Molly.
"For all the film's sweeping, romantic ideas, the actual experience of watching The Dig is a lot like sitting at a bus stop."
I hope what they all got paid made it worth the bother.
"I'm Thinking of Ending Things was always going to be somewhat bizarre, [but] the most perplexing thing about it may be calling it a ""Netflix film."" Prepare to hit play on the platform's oddest release to date."
"You can't make this stuff up, but you can botch the telling of it, and that's what sinks this satiric drama based loosely on a 2004 nonfiction book by London-based journalist Jon Ronson."
Soulless cinema
"The outtakes at the end of the film aren't funny either, but are instructive evidence of the extent of post-production tampering %u2013 several comprise scenes that aren't in the final cut. It's not hard to see why. A shame they didn't cut out the other 9"
This slick doodle of a movie is nothing so much as an advertisement for itself.
"The bloom is a bit off the rose with this starry, streamlined adaptation of Tracy Letts's Tony- and Pulitzer-feted 2007 play."
"Stronger never really grabs the audience emotionally, and later in the film, falls into a hurried, perfunctory redemption arc and its happy ending."
"The simultaneously diverting and annoying Chronicle, directed by Josh Trask, is something like the 184th Found-Footage Faux-Doc horror movie of the past few years."

"The three leads are likable, but they can't overcome a slapdash story or some wild overacting by the likes of Luke Wilson, Tim Blake Nelson, Neil Flynn and Clark Gregg."
Frozen II is a visual treat for the eyes that simply has no ambition to be anything more than an average sequel. Let this franchise go away if the only ideas left are generic stories with bare minimum character development

"The majority of the film looks like it could have been a disturbing psychological study ... But then, Rent-A-Pal went down a very unimaginative and cliché horror path toward the end of the film."
"Portman is disappeared, stripped, chained and tortured, raped repeatedly in the Church dungeon and impregnated by the creepy cleric as he forces her to pray nude. Did I mention that the shackled hottie falls in love with him? Move over, Black Snake Moan."
"The Boss, [McCarthy's] latest starring vehicle, once again gives her the insults, the bad attitude, and the sudden change of heart, and the whole routine feels stale."

A potentially charming premise yields only a handful of chuckles.
"Luhrmann's take on perhaps the original American #RichPeopleProblems novel -- about misplaced male ambition and romantic longing, and the perils of female drivers -- is a work of fizzy, surface decadence."

"par for the course in a town that sees every old idea as something waiting to be deconstructed, reinvented, or reimagined."
"Fatally emasculated by the need to appease young fans. The premise alone carries it so far, but cinematically speaking, it's a non-event."

"A premissa  interessante, mas  destruda pelo roteiro cheio de furos. Apesar de tudo, Jack Palance oferece um desempenho marcante em sua estria no Cinema."
"Superbly designed and animated, but it's also a cluttered endeavor, spending too much time explaining what's going on instead of experiencing the rich multiverse co-writer/director Gutierrez is laboring to create."
"The problem is that the procedural/thriller aspects are genuinely boring compared to the film's human side, where its often heartwarming-yet-hurt sensibility is often engaging and, surprisingly, wise."
Disposable made-for-HBO western.
Virtually every moment of introspective tenderness mustered up by this trio ends up undermined by Mills' super-precious execution.
Vanity Fair nearly tanks due to Nair's anti-Brit slant. Long live the Reese!
"This movie doesn't have half the imagination of even the most subpar circus and, all told, I think it even has fewer elephants."
"Offering around a dozen barely there, aggressively agreeable mini-stories spliced together and spit out with lawnmower-style eloquence, the film is pushed to punishing lengths by the engorged cast list."

It's certainly a better Terminator film than the previous two. But it's also not in the same league as Terminator 2: Judgement Day.
"Ghosts of Cite Soleil is a curiously unfocused, rambling film that never really settles on exactly what it wants to say or exactly which stories it wants to tell."
"Die Mommie Die! seems more like an amateur revue, perfectly all right for what it is, but not meant to be seen beyond an audience of friends and family."

It relies heavily on visual dynamics and doesn't quite achieve the emotional catharsis it aims for.
An intellectually vacant and pointless excursion to a town that is almost frightening in its artificiality.
Gilliam's weirdest -- and most disappointing.

"Directing partners Scott McGehee and David Siegel go more mainstream and downstream with this modern-day, loose riff on Henry James' late-19th-century novel."
"To be fair to Deathly Hallows, the filmmakers have tried hard to fill the proceedings with battles and chases and debilitating curses. Genuine filmmaking excitement, however, is harder to provide."
"Some of the film's ugliness is therefore a sign of integrity, and of relevance. But much of it seems dumb and ill considered, as if Mr. Tarantino's intellectual ambition and his storytelling discipline had failed him at the same time."
It's like a fashion magazine put out a video to help you sleep.
"[Keaton] summons a wonderful performance by Kelly Macdonald and strong character distinction to the secondary players, but otherwise his movie works only in fragments."
"Pokemon fans will be delighted at the visual interpretations of a beloved franchise, but the pervasive mildness of it all makes for an easily forgettable production."
[Its] indictment of the human capacity for hatred and violence is nothing next to its status as a long lost Keystone Kops feature cut together with the world's worst folk musical.
"In terms of escapist fun, this one ranks right up there with a newsreel tour of ground zero in Hiroshima and Nagasaki."
"Like pretty much everything else in Levity, [Thornton's] an earnest, faultlessly compassionate bore."

"While Yogi's somewhat haunting approach will polarise audiences, there isn't enough substance in I Was a Simple Man to build a connection with its protagonist."
Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney star in a romantic comedy that struggles to capture the charm and ebullience of Four Weddings and a Funeral.
"Mr. Heston, who appears to be able to act as well as to project a virile personality, has yet to find out that trying to deliver a well-rounded, intelligent characterization under these circumstances only compounds confusion."
There is a disquieting sense that the director has fallen prey to the poetics of space at the expense of the lives within it.
"...takes its place among a small group of undersea motion pictures. Unfortunately, it takes its place at the end of the line."
"From the lowest-common-denominator, hate-speech shock value of the dialogue to the third-act insertion of a rapist ex machina, Three Billboards ... is genuinely loathsome."
"Most scenes stick to the same formula – awkward situation arises, characters verbally fumble their way through it – but Hill and Barris’s script seems unsure of just how wacky or eccentric it’s allowed to be..."
They are all just guests at a camp masked ball - poised to unveil themselves in a denouement that somehow manages to be more outlandish - and more comic - than all the bumps and rattles that went before.
"Everything in and about Baigelman's debut is irritatingly derivative: second-hand plot, small-time characters, limited and movieish vision, and bad performances for Reeves and Diaz."
"Stone's movie is one of the most frustrating kinds to run into while covering a festival comprised of upcoming filmmakers, the calling card project."
"Lupino takes a down-to-earth look at the ethics of marriage and the moral dilemmas of bigamy, but while his melodrama has interesting moments, I have a feeling that it lacks dramatic punch. [Full review in Spanish]"
&#8220;Hustlers&#8221; is a fairly basic crime drama that plays around with some good ideas but ultimately can&#8217;t quite get out of its own way&#46;
"A mechanical series of violent set-pieces decorated with underdressed hotties. It's handsome but astonishingly dull and weirdly sexless, despite the aforementioned underdressed girls and frequent discussion of Nika's undergarments or lack thereof."
"Final score: Book 1, Movie 0."
"In 1939, it [dialogue] was hip and maybe even scandalous...That type of talk and the behavior of these characters crossed the oldie-moldy line somewhere in the early 1970s."
"Nothing to write home about, but with some decent fight sequences, good stunts, and amusing banter between Stallone and Kang. No need to rush out to the cineplex, although worthwhile to catch on-demand later this year."
Another of those loveable-loser sagas that have become a tiresome staple of British comedies.
We need to be fixing global warming. And yet people who are probably pretty smart and consider themselves creative thinkers are spending their time on this.

"Seems trapped between theatre and cinema, with nobody around to chew its leg off."
"In his first time out as a writer-director, Mr. Bezucha, formerly in charge of creative design for Polo/Ralph Lauren and Coach, drags his feet, pops corn and sometimes stumbles."
"The movie maintains a sour undercurrent of emotional imbalance, as Sturgess' neediness and hatefulness dominate the story, even as he remains the more dynamic and protean personality."
...an origin story that fails to build on what it's trying to establish.
"It's unclear why Garcia continues to choose to limit himself to these diluted portraits, rather than the layered and textured worlds that his writing and directing hint at."
"Not a moment in this film is original, but it will entertain young teenage girls -- the group of 'tweens I saw it with were on their cell phones before the closing credits, raving to their friends."
This ridiculously contrived tale has holes so big in it that an entire prison population could escape through them.
"""Guns Akimbo"" feels more like a missed opportunity. It may have been pacey and some of the acrobatic cameraworks are technically impressive but Jason Lei Howden's script is so hollow that it's hard to care much about everything been going on here."
It's as if director Fernando Meirelles got so wrapped up in the desolation of his story that he neglected to do anything meaningful with it.

"What fans of the original will immediately glean from the quasi-remake, now simply titled Death Race, is just how prophetic Bartel's film was and how desperately the new film needs its forebear's sense of irony."
Oh-so-awkward and irksomely pompous.
Evil Dead 2 is too ludicrous to be subversive. 
"As much as you want to applaud the movie's winking commitment to its own Looney Tunes logic, it's frustrating when lazy and illogical plot devices are used like cattle prods."
"Somewhere between Ready Player One and The Emoji Movie, summoning up a zero-gravity spectacle of dazzling colours and vertiginous perspectives, a featureless and inert mashup of memes, brands, avatars and jokes."
"The film version of Twelve is quite the opposite of the book, a dull and thoughtless ride with a sad excuse for a climax."
"The same ethical solipsism that enabled Owens’ past adventures abroad presides over Crawdads, and Newman’s film can’t escape it, either."
A mess.
"The film is often hard to take, offering laughs that are rarely cathartic enough to compensate."
"Suffused with an overwhelming, choking feeling of pure boredom, shading into self-loathing."
We know before we&#8217;ve even sat down in the theater who&#8217;s going to end up taking care of that cat&#46;
"The film as a whole lacks a pulse-pounding, swoony mood of adventure and romance. Still, it does have Cruise, and he's almost worth a recommendation alone for his spirited efforts."
"Four is a tease, promising muscular genre goods it never delivers, led by a painfully robotic performance from English actor Pettyfer, who spends the entirety of his screentime fussing with his unconvincing American accent."
"A low-key genre exercise, easy to watch but equally easy to forget."
"If taken in the right humor, there is almost something charming about its utter refusal to offer anything fresh or even incidentally clever. However, it's hard to see because the film is also relentlessly boring."
Dave Bautista might be able to bench press the combined weight of the rest of the cast in this inept action comedy - but he sure as hell can't carry a movie.
"Wild Mountain Thyme is extremely off-putting because the filmmakers want to pretend that it's a feminist movie, when it's just the opposite ... The movie really just stinks like the garbage that it is."

This movie is about drawing things out as much as possible to make a snack-size story feel like a meal.

Falls apart.
"While ""Siberia"" has designs on combining thriller elements with a serious romantic drama about love, commitment and masculine codes of honor, it doesn't work out that way."
Everything that seemed fresh back then seems overcooked and tired now. We are in retread territory here: a place where films didn't need to exist.

"Even with helpful title cards telling us it's ""MONDAY,"" ""TUESDAY,"" etc., etc., this is a week that feels 10 days long."
"Anyone who's ever seen an After School Special knows where the family-friendly Breakfast With Scot is headed, no matter how well intentioned."
"As the end of the road finally draws near, you'll need to pull over and throw up."
"So insubstantial that it practically evaporates on screen, Pooh's Heffalump Movie likely will play best with toddlers and pre-schoolers easily amused by bright colors, merry songs and lovable, huggable toontoon animals."
"Laced with telegraphed character development, ghost-in-the-machine plot points, and preachy commentary, ""State of Play"" is a pedantic thriller caught in its own obvious clockwork."

"Instead of adding to the experience, the pic's ill-conceived twists amount to a severe miscalculation on Cortes' part."
"Rambo: Last Blood is basically Taken meets Home Alone, only racist."
An absolutely disastrous piece of work...
"Grindingly monotonous, a blur of thudding body blows."
Few filmmakers in the last twenty years have so consistently had so little to say as loudly as Oliver Stone.
&#91;T&#93;he mechanics of an unconvincing thriller gradually overshadow the attempted purpose of this tale&#46;
Gestures at similar ideas and borrows familiar plot points but makes the classic reboot mistake of adding too much story to what should have been a more concentrated reimagining of the Pinhead universe.
"I'm not sure who the target audience is for Legion - it's too talky for the action crowd, and anyone who knows the Bible will find it ridiculous"
"More than anything, the film finds Laranas struggling to decide whether he wanted to make a horror film or a haunting gothic melodrama, though not managing to nail either"
Scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company.
"""October Baby"" looks and feels like a Lifetime movie waiting not to happen."
"There's an important lesson here: Whatever immortal ninja temple guardians tell you, take it with a grain of salt because they tend to exaggerate. Speaking of untrustworthy pronouncements, remember when Jet Li said he was retiring?"
"Whizbang editing aside, it's a slow slog of a movie with a seriously obvious destination."
A dull Blade indeed!
"For a story about a shooting, Van Sant completely misses the target."

A sentimental and painfully mundane European drama.
"A meandering movie that sometimes hits dead center and sometimes misfires dismally, resulting in a drama more tangled than taut."

"Dudes, we get it."
"[D]espite a fair amount of suspense and good performances from all three leads, this is one of those films where [the central] scheme ... depends on a million little unpredictable details breaking properly."

"It's just another Hollywood comedy. There's nothing terribly wrong with that, but there's nothing terribly right with it either."
"A kid rescues the President. It sounds like a joke movie The Onion might invent to satirize Hollywood preposterousness, but I swear to god, it's real."
"Like its almost-demented heroine, The Messenger is unnervingly consumed with energy."

"It would be hard to think of a worse idea than casting Melanie Griffith, with her soft-as-down little-girl voice, as a jaded New York homicide cop."
"The mystery develops in directions that aren't remotely interesting, leaving the entire movie feeling flat. At least it's beautifully photographed in stunning Norwegian scenery."
It is bad&#44; but not in an enjoyable way&#59; it is violent and squalid&#44; but not in a memorable way&#46;
Just one more example of why this would be a better movie world if the screenplay were perceived as being the most crucial element of a film package.

Barbara Broccoli has asked the world to support brilliant new female characters beyond Bond - but hasn't quite given us one here.

"For all its attempts to heavily overcomplicate both its narrative and its aesthetic, Manglehorn sure is simplistic and bland"
"Deception is one of those films that leave you feeling vaguely dirty and wholly unsatisfied, a distasteful and wholly unbelievable mix of soft porn and obvious duplicity that holds not one ounce of emotional truth."
"At one point during this film, I was just in a perpetual eye-roll. It wasn't funny, endearing or even mildly entertaining. Why did they make this?"
A dominant Whitaker lords over this flawed mixture of history and intrigue.

"While no doubt determined to make a sequel worthy of the original, the makers of this movie ended up with a film that comes in second best by a long shot. It achieves mediocrity only because of the talent of the actors carried over from the original film."
"This feature is X-treme only in its multidimensional dullness, which is compounded by interviews in which the interchangeable thrillbots discuss themselves and each other with an immense lack of insight."
"Forget art, or even craft: This is the kind of movie that can't even get its shameless audience-pandering in order."
"The big mystery is whether or not Salt is a sleeper commie succumbing to Stockholm Syndrome, or just a peeved wife who can't seem to master the knack of folding sexy dinner napkins to impress her spouse, a specialist in North Korean bugs."
Detaching Piaf's wildly contradictory life from the larger realities of French social life weakens the film and makes her own behavior somewhat arbitrary.
"It's a pretty take on the story, but it's also a frustratingly safe and squishy one."
"There's not much to grab onto logic-wise, because so little is revealed. That leaves Cronenberg's gifted cast to pile intrigue and emotion on a mostly blank page."
"Ang Lee's attempt to put the Swinging Sixties on the screen with love, respect and a dash of humour is a distinct disappointment."
"What's shocking about this movie, in the context of [Daniels'] arresting body of work, is how thin and wooden it is, how cautiously attached to the conventions of its genre."
"Attempts to masquerade as a historical drama, but twists the facts to have them fit the traditional Hollywood courtroom drama."
"In a comedy era ennobled by the crackling wit of Vince Vaughn, Steve Carell and Tina Fey, Yes Man comes across as innocent, quaint, pitiable, as one-note as borscht belt humor and not committed enough to support great slapstick."
7500 operates as pure distraction - something to watch in the background without too much focus.
"Mr. Stewart is nobody's bumpkin when it comes to dumb stereotypes. Still, the scheme of his script requires them, and they aren't all that amusing, even in retrospect."
"A strangely flat, uninspired animated comedy."
"Perhaps if you are in the mood for a good laugh and want to see something that straddles the line between idiotic and hilarious, you may enjoy this"
"The film around them is too, too much: too gruesome, too locker-room, too busy, too populated, and too daft."
Ultimately fails to match the competence of its director.
The film progresses in a manner that's more comatose than undead.
"Too much of Miss Americana plays like we should crane our necks back and look up to one of the most popular people on the planet, and just appreciate them for reminding us that they too are human."
"Fortunately, what keeps this film afloat - barely - is its spot-on casting. Everyone is picture perfect."
"Not that you can only make a certain number of films about a particular subject, but there is a limit. Especially when you are not really bringing anything new to the proceedings."
The problem lies less with what the film has to say than the way it says it: the laboriousness with which its sermon on the seeds of fascism is spelled out.
"Except for Myers, and for many he will make the movie worth watching. He's absolutely shagadelic and completely unexpected. This should have been his movie."
The structure is a mess. The characters are plastic. And the lines are Seventies sitcom bad.
"It sounds like an interesting story, but Liza Johnson's asinine film will shock you with how little you care."
"Quite frankly, I can't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a McCulloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out."
"In comparison to the Kar-Wai and Soderbergh segments, The Dangerous Thread of Things is a languorous bore that provides an unsatisfying coda to Eros."
"The ideas are all there, but what it has in premise, it lacks it delivery."
"If teens battling soldiers sounds like your cup of tea, drink deep. If not, stick with Red Dawn."
Awash in 1970s filmmaking and the kind of stylized folksiness that pickling Brooklyn hipsters with handlebar mustaches will positively drool over.
"Much of it feels synthetic and crude, more the result of engineering than inspiration. The [filmmakers] put a commercial glaze on everything, as if a future TV series were taking over the movie even as it was unreeling in the projector. "
"Equipped with a cheesy Z-grade plot, forgettable villains, and some jaw-droppingly clunky lines of dialogue, Vanguard is that unashamedly old-fashioned Chan vehicle which makes one ponder why he's still going at it."
"As for the space stuff, well, George Lucas need not lose any sleep."
"Unfortunately, the screenplay is awful. It gives away the ending early on, which removes any suspense, and pointlessly plays with time so that it's hard to know what is happening when, let alone why."
"I can't say that it is some kind of comedy classic or that it even rises above the classification of ""fitfully amusing"" but I will say that I found myself laughing more often than I might have imagined possible"
"Pat, contrived and entirely predictable."
Jaws is looking a bit long in the tooth these days.
"Eight years is enough distance for Hollywood to deem [Bosnia] a suitable venue for battlefield derring-do, turning suffering, destruction and genocide into mindless spectacle."
"A standard, heavy-weight drama about the self-destructive effects of alcohol abuse, reminiscent but never as good as 'The Days of Wine and Roses.'"
"This may be based on a true story, but, onscreen, it comes off as a cornball, none-too-exciting, second-rate version of that granddaddy of all satanic possession movies, The Exorcist."
Tthere are pleasures to be had in this film...you come away wishing there were more.
"Borrowing the name of such a fraught piece of history and making a feel-good comedy about it, then failing to do that piece of history justice, is at best a misstep."
Hillbilly Elegy is whiny and teary...
"Only Bob Hoskins as the blind seer Muir comes close to making us care. We can almost glean Snow White's heroic possibilities through his clouded eyes. As much as we'd like to, we certainly can't from Stewart's efforts."
"Despite the considerable charms of stars Kristen Bell and Josh Duhamel, When in Rome doesn't quite work, in either the love or laughter departments."
Scenes are clunky and disjointed&#46; The dialogue is bad&#46;&#46;&#46;The performances are adequate in the most tepid sense&#46; Playing caricatures instead of characters is challenging&#46;
"Even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering, Miller's hand often feels unsure."
"Bombshell has a terrific performance by Charlize Theron as Megyn Kelly and an interesting story worth telling. However, the muddled tone, hollow characters, and awkward pacing make it a forgettable watch."
It's just plain lazy (or incompetent or both) filmmaking from start to finish.
"By trying to give ""The Trip to Greece"" some heft, Winterbottom only draws attention to the series' lack of interest in history, other people, the politics of global tourism and, well, the world."
"The characters maintain a frustrating emotional distance, not from each other as much as from the audience."
"Mike Myers' new comedy, The Love Guru, is a disappointment, but it's not a disaster, and that's at least something."
"Like Polonius in ""Hamlet,"" All the King's Men takes on airs as it pretends to explain the mysteries of life although it really says nothing of significance."
Gallingly leaden remake of the 1941 Lon Chaney Jr. classic both lives and dies by its transformations.
"An abundance of long, flat medium shots that rob the film of intimacy and give it a sleepy pace."
Tina Fey is the biggest asset but even she's not sufficient to make it worth more than a marginal recommendation and a suggestion to wait until it shows up on home video.
"Zellweger shines in Judy's dramatic mannerisms, vibrant emotionalism, and sly, self-deprecating sense of humor. She deserves a movie as complicated as her performance."
How did a cast like this sign on for a movie like this?
"A computer-generated ending might have been an improvement on screenwriter Paul Rudnick's, which goes so haywire you can almost see the smoke."
The central plot development...is galvanizing in theory but mostly just confusing in practice.
Songbird wastes its potential. [Full Review in Spanish]
"It's contemplative and meditative, sure, but it doesn't wind up saying anything."
"Alex first appears in Snow Cake aboard a plane, embodying an obvious contradiction, in motion and still at the same time."
A movie pandering to teens that is very obviously made by a fifty year old man if he were trying to write like Diablo Cody.
"An experimental film that's lost sight of what the experiment was supposed to be, a thematic treatise playing peek-a-boo with its themes."
It has an intriguing crisis at its core&#44; but ultimately succumbs to the same problems its predecessors did in that the screenplay is extremely weak&#44; once more padding the film out to an absurd runtime with monotonous action sequences&#46;
"Positioned as a hell-raising alternative to normal comic book fare, ""Suicide Squad"" doesn't maintain the illusion, consuming genre sameness as Ayer takes a punk rock concept and turns it into a bland, mainstream extravaganza."
"Godsend wants desperately to be The Omen, Rosemary's Baby or even The Bad Seed, but it doesn't trust its audience."
"This will undoubtedly appeal to fans of a conspiracy theory, but thrillseekers will be left feeling short-changed."
"There’s something wrong with the children, all right. The filmmakers can’t figure out what to do with them."
Moore's excruciating performance will give pause to anyone who thinks 'the method' isn't without its madness.
"If the film does anything right, it reminds us that now-48-year-old Hayek is one heck of a forceful presence when she is allowed to be."
"You sit there feeling like a park ranger under the influence of hallucinogens, gripped by unending discomfort as the film's contradictory existence balloons out of proportion."
"If the movie is not as dangerous as its detractors claim, neither is it as glorious and memorable as some of its less discriminating admirers would have it."
It's hard to be engaged when the characters themselves seem so detached.
Certain echoes from Allen's own tabloid ferment get channeled through bombastic speakers here.
"Vinterberg has made a gentle, unintrusive film, graceful and too refined to speak out of turn."
"Underwhelming action thriller has deaths, violence."
The charismatic cast (particularly Banks and Lopez) manage to find the humanity in their clichd roles but they can't transcend all the surface-level schmaltz on display here.
... the comedy of Iron Sky is so broad and on the nose that the majority of the jokes just did not work for me. Some were painfully unfunny. And with a premise this ingenious that is just a little bit sad.
There's plenty of stupidity... from talking wolves and geisha-like vampire make-up to the most uncomfortable newborn baby moment this side of A Serbian Film.
"While it is still better than most recent American horror films, it is easily the least of the ""Dead"" films and lacks the snap and the provocative power of his best efforts."
Derbez basically takes a nap in the part&#44; contributing little to an absurdly overlong effort that lacks charm and especially pace&#44; going about its business often in the least memorable way possible&#46;
[The thrills] fail to land.
You can feel the heat rising off of Van Gogh's palms but they stay swimming in search of something the film can't quite ever grab ahold of.
"Elizabeth: Full Throttle. Elizabeth: The Heretic. Elizabeth: Book of Shadows. Despite all the peacock kerfluffery Kapur can conjure, this remains an inscrutable film, in intent as well as execution."
"There is much to like in Burton's Sweeney Todd and much not to like, a rather hit-and-miss affair."
"The balance between true-crime cable soap and the darker, richer layers of Franco's performance never quite adds up."
"Aquaman was a film that could have been great, but fell flat. The amazing CGI did not make up for the cheesey jokes and what felt like a dumbed down script."
"In addition to being dull, Untraceable is a monster hypocrite, wagging its finger at the mass audience's appetite for strictly regimented, 'creative' torture scenarios. This film is not really in a position to point a finger."
"If Disney insists on raiding its own vaults for remakes, maybe they'll have better luck with The Laser-Vision, Missile-Launching, Face-Shredding Cat from Outer Space."
"For anyone whose age has reached double figures, it'll be hard to see this as anything other than a shouty, tacky advert for things you'll never buy."
"Showing how helpless our emotions (or lack thereof) can make us feel, The Children Act feels plagued by its own doomed destiny."
A buddy movie rip-off of Trading Places.
"It's already been mentioned that the visual effects are not what will annoy you the most; however, that does not mean they are good. [Full review in Spanish]"
It's a Hasbro ad. It's a Chevy commercial. It's a pitch for Homeland Security. (A pretty ineffective one.)
"It demands love, which is the best way not to get it."
Cameron Diaz eats the screen up in Bad Teacher but can't withstand the enormously dim-witted script.
"Overall, no-one's going to be needing a cold shower after this. However, half a glass of something beforehand in the company of like-minded friends is definitely recommended."
As professionally mediocre as its predecessors.
"If Against the Ropes were a comedy, it would be called Pugilistally Blonde."
Things ... get hinky as the script struggles to wrap up its numerous tragedies and conflicts this movie is too synthetic to effectively deal with the subplots it introduces.
"Even as straightforward eye candy, the film is a near miss"
"Proof of Life is intelligent, but culturally biased and less than altogether compelling."
"Strives to make an exploitation mess with charged elements, but it can barely sustain interest in itself, missing the fun and snowballing panic this type of multiplex junk food is known for."
"The opening mid-air shootout is edgy, funny and clouded in question-raising mystique. It's everything the film that follows is not."
"Every teacher is a burn-out, every student is a fraud and experimental artists are the worst burn-outs and frauds of all."
It's a derivative and incoherent exercise that provides another opportunity for Jason Statham to play the same type of vigilante character that he's essentially kept repeating for more than a decade.
"Bernstein's music, Sondheim's lyrics and Robbins's choreography are great, but as a movie it falls short of the truly inspired cinematic musicals."
A pretty listless satire of workplace culture.
"There is some nobility in the film's relentlessness and single-minded focus, but not enough to redeem its lack of having anything much to say beyond what we get on the surface."
We've seen this movie before.
The only force on Earth so dense that it apparently can't be moved even by the movie's special effects is Christensen's wooden acting.
"Bending the destinies of its principals like so many pipe cleaners, 'Til There Was You dwells mechanically on the mysteries of fate."
Extremely gory Jaws rip-off is too much for kids.
"Hey, if you're into whiny soap operas about self-obsessed people who never shut up complaining about how miserable they are, have at it."
"It's less intrusive and gimmicky [as The Da Vinci Code], but it's also not as enjoyable -- particularly since so much of the movie is familiar, as they go from museum to museum, dodging bad guys and trying to solve the mystery."
"Stilted and unrealistic, this Gable vehicle is still arresting because of LeRoy's terse, professional direction and the star's commanding performance, although Corey and Smith give anemic efforts."
An offshoot of found footage&#44; the setup feels less spontaneous and more manufactured by comparison&#44; leaving the viewer to feel pushed and pulled through the ensuing suspense by the editing&#44; sometimes in clumsy ways&#46;
"This three-hour behemoth is rather poorly paced. It takes nearly half the movie just to get to the war, and it squanders many promising opportunities."
"The story splicing isn't any smoother than the movie's own awkward bio-engineering, and by the film's finale it's hard to care much about any of it."
"The whimsical ugly-duckling fable becomes more uneven as it proceeds, straining too hard to manufacture its quirky charms."
The whole thing is one big fat geek wedding fiasco.
This thing is so silly and so ridiculous.
"Irresistible isn't just shockingly ineffectual in its insights into national schisms - it is, in an added betrayal, unfunny, requiring its audience to slog their way through so much laborious farce without a laugh in sight."
An odd but sometimes lovable little mixture of great rock 'n' roll and charmingly primitive filmmaking.
"This big, bone-headed and unintentionally laughable techno-fear thriller is a movie in one hell of a hurry."
"Nothing against Kate Winslet, Josh Brolin and director Jason Reitman - top talents all - but my goodwill drowned while trying to swallow this treacly cocktail of romantic swill."
"Hollywood, this isn't good enough. Silent Hill deserves better. Audiences deserve better. Video games deserve better. And frankly, the film industry deserves better."
Allen's creative revival comes to a juddering halt with a foursome of would-be amusing vignettes that barely muster a laugh between them.
"Every time [Pearce is] off-screen, the premise's silliness starts to seem exactly that -- silly."
"Cold, shallow and lackluster despite breathtaking cinematography and costume design."
"Moments of brevity are a welcome distraction, but the film's biggest laughs come at its own expense."
"Keanu Reeves gives a good physical performance as Klaatu, the alien newly inhabiting a human body, but his utterly humorless alien has, well, an alienating effect."
"The Clearing, rather fuzzy in so many ways, is an incredibly slow-moving exercise in tedium."
You won't be as easily impressed.
"Everyone knows the image this film is about... A movie about a picture is slightly unusual, and regrettably nowhere near as memorable as the original image."
Sitcom leftovers are artlessly reheated in this repetitive and exaggerated romantic comedy-drama about a newlywed couple.
An annoying musical.
The story's structure is unspontaneous and utterly common.
"Yup, it's a dog alright."
"Like the Strip itself, it's all lights and music throbbing so hard you confuse yourself into thinking you're having fun."
Texas Chainsaw Massacre avoids innovation to jump into as many cow-pies as it can find.
"Paradoxically, ""Don't Think Twice"" feels both dramatically thin and overstuffed."
"Like refusing to show the planting of the American flag on the moon in THE FIRST MAN, the infamous Monkey Business photo is missing in THE FRONT RUNNER. Whose agenda is being served?"
"This is a dead movie. I don't know exactly when it passed away, but I think it was dead by the time they started filming it, and it may have died even earlier."
"I know that Platoon is being acclaimed for its realism, and I expect to be chastened for being a woman finding fault with a war film. But I've probably seen as much combat as most of the men saying, 'This is how war is.'"
"Without a kinky moment towards the end where it seems like Alexa is going to lay a big wet one on a Predator, there's almost no reason to stay awake."
"The film is proof that even extremely over-the-top films can be monotonous in that their one tone is ""ARGH!"""
Ree's film pulls us into the lives of characters who live in ways that never totally compute.
"""They made it ugly,"" says Reed Richards. Yes son, they did."
Fatiguingly mundane snoozer.
"One might wish that [the filmmakers] had kept [Joseph] Smith an enigmatic side character, and focused more on how these three followers persevered in his wake."
Not worth the repeat check-in.
"Oh dear. Oh no. Ophelia. A curious, if ambitious, central conceit is here battered into inconsequentiality by a scattershot screenplay that flees so far from the original Shakespeare that it leaves little purpose, or relevant material, in the retelling."
The mixture of artistic sophistication and emotional crudeness cancel each other out.
"There's a lot here that is familiar, and not just to those who have spent a few Saturday afternoons watching Sam Peckinpah war pictures."
A thematically confused and misdirected effort to reduce Wallace's story of faith and redemption into a Hollywood blockbuster in an age where the market has become desensitized to violence elsewhere that entertainment must go to a further extreme.
"As the two Sams struggle to find their humanity, the film struggles to find entertainment within the esoteric. While they're trying to figure it out, we're left stranded on the dark side of the moon."
"Too schizophrenic to succeed, as a remake or a stand-alone film."
"Here's the bottom line: the film's trailer contains just about every good laugh in the picture and never wears out its welcome. Also, it's free."
The rhythm has dormant effects. It's a film without many dramatic dimensions. [Full review in Spanish]
"If this isn't Boll's best effort to date, it's better than his usual output. If he can continue to improve, his name may no longer be synonymous with a punch line."
"Kirkpatrick keeps stomping on the drama pedal while blowing the clich horn, yielding scene after tired scene of predictable developments as the principals keep shoving guns into mouths and screaming obscenities."
A shapeless homage to the glory that was Studio 54 in its decadent heyday...
"A swampy mystery, a soggy action film, and a waterlogged love story."
It isn't engaging enough to really work and the direction lacks the imagination that might have breathed some life into it.
"When a film stars three people you adore and still falters, the instinct is to blame the director. But that's tricky when the director is one of the people you adore."
John Carpenter seems to be hovering between cold-eyed mechanical fear-making and horror camp.
"Plays like a collection of outtakes from some ""Saw"" script that never saw the light of day (or, heaven forbid, has yet to be made)."
"A mildly amusing gay comedy, with the only novel point of Cary Grant serving as a spiritual mentor; the rest is formula."
"Scenery rushes by, noise blares, characters pop up wearing new costumes that they couldn't possibly have had time to change into as they eluded their adversaries."
"Everyone overacts, leaning heavily on moments of unexpected shouting, with Hardy taking bottom honors."
"Alicia Vikander worked herself into hardbody shape for Tomb Raider, which by contrast is a flabby, lazy mess."
"Even at its highest points, it cannot claim a place next to even the least of the great Disney classics."
It wasn't evil aliens that defeated the Justice League: it was facial hair.
You'll probably have more fun waiting in the popcorn line.
"You can see what The Lobster is trying to say so clearly that there's never that refreshing possibility of misunderstanding or ambiguity, essential for a real work of genius."
"Most of the actors have elected to play their knights like crotchety Western gunslingers, a bizarre choice that blows a good deal of fresh air into the stuffy pageantry."
"It's a well-made film with some nice performances, but it lacks any sort of dramatic fire."
"The thriller side of this movie is falling flat, as the stalker doesn't do much stalking, and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case."
It would be hard to imagine a filmmaking style as serious yet lazy as the earnest vrit bobbing and weaving employed by La Petite Jrusalem.
"If you have two hours to live, see this movie ? it will make those two hours seem like two weeks."
A multi-character mess...
"A complete and utter artistic failure, if also fascinating enough in its awfulness to likely endure as a perversely-admired cult classic. It could've been worse - it could've been boring."
You're left with flashes of mis-spent promise: the feline mysticism; the cosmetics-industry intrigue; the idea of electrocuting Lambert Wilson's unctious corporate cad.
"It is not the worst movie this year, and it does get better towards the end. But a few smiles do not make up for the fails."
The result is not only ineffective but becomes a dramatically inert&#44; overly violent embarrassment for both De Niro and Travolta&#46;
"could have been a perfectly fine B-grade thriller, but Bornedal overestimates his cleverness"
"As the film gambols toward its inevitable fiery climax, it gets sloppier and sloppier with its storytelling and political restraint."
"The historic storyline is far better done than the present day one, which ultimately leads to half a decent movie and another half that's almost unbearable."
Lee Sang-il's film lasts 140 minutes and after 100 we all want to go home.
"Unfortunately, ""The Presidio"" never progresses beyond its promising setup."
Go Back to China is a well-crafted film completely undone by a horrendous screenplay.
Screenwriter Edward Anderson drops the South African angle in favor of more conventional developments and has a hard time bringing this across the finish line without a number of implausibilities.
I don't quite understand why screenwriters try to cram their more nuanced or interesting characters into something as conventional as the final act of Training Day.
...It's simply not enticing enough...
"Empathy for the all-too-real plight of the working poor drives this heavy but bold indie. Sadly, though, it falters under the weight of too much drama."
"Love him or hate him, there's no denying that George W. Bush is a remarkably controversial figure, so how is it possible that Stone has managed to make a movie that's about as incendiary as Kung Fu Panda?"
The movie never captures the crucial leap that made the book a hit. It's never Marley & Us.
Toad Road is not a success and I must continue to fantasize about how great the film could have been.
"Despite having all the ingredients for an enjoyably glitzy piece of royal camp, it's formidably dull."
"You wait all year for a lesbian comedy drama with the production values of a 1980s TV movie and the acting standard of a carpet shampoo advert, and then two come along at once."
"A more accurate title would... be Island, but Plane is perhaps best at least for instructing audience on the best location to watch the film, half-awake, tipsy on wine served from a litre bottle."
"For the most part, ""Coming 2 America"" falls back on familiar punchlines, serving up nearly word-for-word repeats of amusing bits from the original, but they don't necessarily play the same in this context..."
"It eventually falls victim to one or two twists too many, needlessly complicating an already complex plot."
"Like a Comic-Con cosplay event gone horribly wrong, this poor excuse for an action comedy has nothing to say beyond a few expletives and nothing to offer but a shocking lack of appreciation for its own awful irony."
It's enough to make that Joan of Arc heavy metal rock opera seem normal.
Now is the time to make a statement -- reflecting on the failures of the current administration and projecting our hopes for the next. Oliver Stone's W. is not that statement.
"As a story to speak to our hearts and minds, it's an utter failure, and perhaps so too even as a disposable corporate product."
"It's not particularly original, but if your idea of fun is a bloody shootout followed by a Lionel Richie song, you could do worse."
"[Take the Lead] hits all its marks, but never dazzles anyone with its footwork."
"There's a brief, angelic moment near the end, with the mothers aglow, the fathers proud, and the babies gurgling that almost makes one forget that this is a brutally predictable, wildly unfunny film. Almost."
...overblown so-so suspense flick...
How is something that is supposed to be small become something that is way&#44; way&#44; way too much&#63;
"Swardson and the gang generally opt for silly over edgy and outrageous, but Bucky is just too dashed-off a character for the movie to get by on that."
"At least it doesn't waste any time. At somewhere near the 30-second mark, it gets right down to business, and that business is the kind of humor that doesn't usually get named in this paper."
Mangold gets stuck in the gooey sweet spots of his tale a little more often than he breaks loose with a bracing jolt of perversity.
Will engage your little ones minimally while in the theaters but will leave them without any desire to get the DVD later in order to see it again.
The final product feels like more of an interesting and beautifully filmed anecdote than compelling political and human drama.
"When Kaye tries to be funny, he's odd; when he tries to be sad, he's boring; and when he tries to be happy, he's . . . just weird."
"Dumbed-down, tree-hugging propaganda trying to masquerade as an action film."
"The plot needs to be airtight, and Identity is filled with logistical holes."
Less bizarrely funny than just bizarre. You're likely to leave it feeling more exhausted than entertained.
"I won't tell you who wins the Rudo/Cursi showdown, but when it comes to the Cuarón brothers, my money's on Alfonso."
British security-blanket film-making at its finest.
"The dreamlike amber washes and comic visual asides stress the otherness of the pair's reality, but seem to offer a limp excuse for their deluded exemption from empathy."
Ineptly crunched film version of Natalie Babbitt's acclaimed 1975 children's book.
"The constant agitation and bone-deep respect for all things military is straight out of Clancy's playbook, but there's no Jack Ryan figure to humanize it all...There's very little to hold on to. For the most part, we just watch a lot of gears grind..."
"The movie doesn't have the smarts of Free Willy, and its series of cliffhanging crises is so relentless that we become aware of tireless screenwriters, manipulating that true story for all its worth."
"Directed by Stephen Hopkins, the film begins gracefully, judiciously. Sadly, in its final 20 minutes, it throws its admirable caution to the wind."
"When Things Heard & Seen attempts to entangle marital issues with a paranormal influence, it becomes muddled in its own themes."
"If it's possible to overact while barely blinking, Ryan Gosling achieves it."
"Relatively compelling at the time, it's just a bit too glib to resonate for much longer afterwards."
"Should be a perfectly solid basis for a medieval gorefest, but there's something inescapably Holy Grail-ish about the clueless staging."
"...it would have been better set in the Polish brothers' allegorical, surreal world, rather than ours."
One of many recent films that could serve as a recruiting advertisement for Al Qaeda.

"There's actually a lot of things to like about Faster, but the final mixture of dissimilar elements leaves us with a strange creature whose head doesn't quite know what its tail is doing."
"There's no extra meaning here, and if there is, it's really not worth pursuing. I was done with it when it was done..."
"The film tends to forget that these are supernatural creatures (it's not scary at all), and it quickly turns into a pretty standard-issue ""revolt of the slaves"" action picture (with very poor action scenes)."
"Though the essays are smartly written and Pantoliano manages to make Elliot vaguely sympathetic, Second Best is a long slog in the dumps."
"... when the adult is a lout and the child is a silent dullard, the formula loses its punch."
"Blandly internationalized, generically derivative, drained of any personality, edited as if by computer and bleached of the slightest hint of emotion... The Meg is a one hundred percent inorganic meal."
"If all you're here to see is some good a cappella performance and one last farewell from the characters you love, Pitch Perfect 3 is merely adequate."
"It's very possible that the subject just doesn't deserve a biopic, that quite possibly Bettie Page's impact on the popular culture is more interesting than how she made that impact."
There's no way audiences would pay to see The Week Of at a theater. Even streaming it might feel like a rip-off.
"A noble attempt at adapting a tweet thread, but one that should have been saved to drafts."
"The narrative shifts between the ridiculous and the bland, the camp and the straight-faced, never quite knowing what tone to strike for a story that's admittedly absurd."
"This is the kind of teen film that treats teens like children, reassuring them of the values they already stubbornly insist on anyway..."
"Welcome to Jurassic Shark. Glub, glub. A Dwayne Johnson film with Jason Statham as idiot's Captain Ahab."
"Its view of life is that a paradigm-shifting breakthrough, rather than being the product of either solitary genius or cultural ferment, amounts instead to a pretext and a substitute for therapy."
"It's all very handsomely arranged, but even with the concert footage, nothing ever feels live."
I spent the entire movie alternating between checking my watch to see how much was left and wishing that one of them would realize how worthless they were.
Right in line with its awful predecessor...
"A post-apocalyptic road movie that, in my opinion, has noble intentions that are built slowly with good acting from Tom Hanks, but the lack of parts drags its narrative onto conventional paths. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Like quite a few British feel-good films, it's nostalgically set in the 1970s; like even more of them, it's well meant but flimsy."
"What could have been a really interesting film with a unique narrative turns into a pretty grotesque film instead, with tropes rather than well-rounded characters."
"Charm will only get you so far. In this case, even the most charming (and huge) cast can only do so much with this corny compilation."
Works great until it develops a conscience
"Vaughn, Favreau and company phone it in - all the way from Bora Bora - in this lame relationship comedy."
"The Brass Teapot tries to force a moralistic, Twilight Zone-ish plot into an indie comedy, a task that proves impossible for first-time feature director Ramaa Mosley."
"What do you call those guys who paint themselves silver and then stand still like statues? This has one of those. A threatening one. So, if that sounds up your alley..."
"Make no mistake, a good ""Purge"" does not equal a good movie, but the post-apocalyptic thriller is slightly more interesting because it takes itself, and its menace, more seriously."
"Lopez works visibly hard to keep things light, while O'Loughlin's flat performance suggests that he's either deeply uncomfortable or just struggling to hide his Australian accent."
"Vardalos has created a community of characters and players so likable, it seems almost mean to criticize - like picking on one's own annoying but beloved relatives."
"While it might have reignited interest in the original and its sequel, the new ""Fright Night"" itself will probably be forgotten 26 years from now when there won't even be a bargain DVD bin at Walmart for us fish it out of."
"The movie never delves that deeply into who Gloria Grahame was, aside from a femme fatale slinking across a black-and-white screen."
"It is barely a comedy. Heck, it's barely a movie."
"Disaster filmmeister Roland Emmerich meets Shakespeare: behold, Bard-Zilla is nigh!"
Starts mischievous and moves into maudlin.
"It's okay for families, but I don't think there's anything great or new here."
"After a strong beginning, Priest ends with a whiff of Jonah Hex about it."
"As a children's fable, the film lacks magic, due to Weitz's uninspired helming and uneven technical execution, but it's likable, moderately engaging and well-acted by Dakota Blue Richards and Nicole Kidman; too bad Daniel Craig has such a tiny part."
"Writer-director Raymond De Felitta has cut together a frustrating comedy, with the misunderstandings piling up like kindling for a bonfire that his movie never lights."
"A turgid, rotten bore that pretty much signals the death of ""art"" cinema as we know it."
"Aside from some gut-bustlingly funny moments, The Furies is just a little flat and uninspired."
French director Louis Leterrier loves this world. But Clash of the Titans feels like he fought -- and lost -- his own battle for control.
"here are flashes of a much better movie throughout My Best Friend’s Exorcism, but the one we get just isn’t self-possessed enough to hold onto them for long."
"has an almost manic sense of visual intensity despite its traditional two-dimensional hand-drawn characters, and it often comes across like a hyper puppy that is both eager to please and also intent on doing whatever it wants."

"Devlin's script tips its hand so early on that Devil's Due lumbers toward a woefully flat, predictable ending, and the unwelcome promise of something truly demonic - sequels."
"At its best, it's a gentle meditation on mortality. But at weaker moments it feels meandering and strangely empty."
"It's ragged and dull until the magical moment when Jolson turns to the camera to announce, ""You ain't heard nothin' yet""-a line so loaded with unconscious irony that it still raises a few goose bumps."
"Fake beauty and fake history rob Robin Hood of previous moral value. It's no longer ""legendary"" because Scott and Helgeland's sham realism trivializes history."
It is simply so amateurish and overacted that it makes it impossible to become invested in the documentary-like reality De Palma hopes to achieve.
"The movie is hurt more than helped by having to carry over character names and shoehorn in the show's greatest hits, Carell and Hathaway's rhythm faltering with every recycled catchphrase."
The inconsistent character development fits with the inconsistent humor in a movie that falters as often as it shines.
"Arguably the most troubling factor is the lack of true redemption in the twist ending, which resolves the demon possession without allowing good to triumph over evil."
[I]ts slow and safe tone makes it one of the dullest entries in the genre so far. You will probably like it if you read the New Yorker.
"Continues Allen's endless, banal quest for the Big Answers."
"Overplotted, undercooked and extremely well-dressed, ""The Dressmaker"" has style to burn, but it has a mean streak as wide as the Outback."
Ellie looks at a captive Whateverasaurus and gushes that the wonder of seeing dinosaurs &#8220;never gets old&#46;&#8221; 
"Movies like this get made all the time, sometimes they even get released into theaters with a modicum of TV advertising, and they're all about this good, which is to say neither bad nor good, just easily forgettable."
"By the time the film reaches its abrupt conclusion, complete with vast CGI zombie horde, Double Tap has long abandoned any sense of explicitly needing to exist."
"Antonio Banderas is a charming and talented man, but in Take the Lead he lays on the old-world panache so thick -- the accent, the flowery courtliness, the romance of romance -- that he comes off like Dracula's metrosexual cousin."
"Had there been a little more fun here, it would have been a great nostalgic blast."
"The segments of First Descent that trace snowboarding's history are a complete hash, a jumble of old 'boarder footage and generic interviews."
"Since we know what the ending is going to be, the journey in this film has to be interesting, and it just isn't, despite fine performances by Costner and Harrelson."
"By the tenth round of what feels like drama-school exercises writ large, you wish these talents would simply say ""Scene"" and scoot into the wings."
"Lindsay Lohan's car crash career receives another nasty bump in The Canyons, a turgid, very low-budget wallow in Beverly Hills sleaze."
"Wish Upon is pure empty space, a nothing experience that tries to take the easy path to its scares."
Shin Godzilla is a film filled with far more government meetings than Godzilla action. A lack of compelling characters and an abundance of bureaucracy make Godzilla's big screen return a let-down.
Robots is a dazzling visual spectacle that will delight children of all ages. I guess I'm the only one who wonders why as much care and cleverness can't go into the script and the characters and the plot as go in to those dazzling visuals.
So what happens when the audience gets disconnected? They get bored. They lose focus. In a two hour movie this can be devastating.
"This action ""threequel"" is directed by a gentleman named Megaton, so one should not expect subtlety."
"Three weeks may be the ostensible time frame for the plot, but sitting through this nauseatingly whimsical and pointless confection feels like a downright eternity."
"""Defiance"" sometimes is so subtle and well done, you admire Zwick for his reserve and tact. Unfortunately, at other times the movie is so heavy-handed, it can leach into parody."
"Plays like a flowchart in search of a pulse, a drama whose Traffic-like ambitions aren't matched by narrative inspiration."
"Since it purports to be a thriller, well, let's just say the edge of your seat doesn't exactly get a workout."
"I imagine someone like Gareth from The Office watching it, a big grin on his face, a box of tissues by his side."
"Constructed like a calling card for Hollywood employment, as when a montage of funeral and wedding memories is underscored with 'Lilac Wine' by Jeff Buckley."
"[Elisabeth Moss] is a victim in this movie for a long, long time, and I didn't really care for that."
"The tone is jarring throughout, mostly preachy and po-faced, and built upon several awkwardly overperformed scenes (Lots of “ ‘F*** you!’ ‘No, f*** you!’ ”) that mostly feel like offcuts from an Edward Albee tribute play."
"A great movie could be made about a Beatle-free world. Yesterday, unfortunately, is not that movie."
"An average romantic dramedy, 'One Day' tips its hand so early in the game that you won't be a bit surprised by anything that ensues."
"This is a ""bawdy"" big-screen comedy any nervous HR representative could rubber stamp. In its own R-rated way, it's safe for work."
"""Rent"" is a wet blanket musical compared to the likes of ""West Side Story"" or ""Cabaret."""
You can't thread a needle this fine with a script filtered through Bay's puerile id.
"Audacious, original, genre-bending and potentially thought-provoking, full of strong performances and inventive cinematography. Unfortunately, it's also really, really bad."
Octopuses from outer space can't begin to compete with Klaatu or ET.
"Trafficking in arch, winking jokes that even the laziest improv comics would consider beneath them, Alien Trespass is a handsomely mounted, and occasionally well-acted, snooze."
"One of those rare, so-bad-it's-good shoot-'em-ups."
"With battle scenes that are obscenely gruesome and pacing that is too slow, the film lumbers along like a Buick in the mud."
"Pixar, a once-complex house of stories, has been downgraded to the happy meal alternative: ""Brave"" is a movie for six-year-olds."
"The movie ends on strange note, almost as if even Baumbach couldn't stand to spend one more minute with the odious Greenberg."
"The movie's abbreviated title is LOL, which is ironic since Ferrell offers hardly a smile, much less laughter out loud."
This tale may well weave a more compelling spell on the page; onscreen it's simply ponderous.
Too squeaky clean to be offensive but far too long to be entertaining.
"The title of this austere, slow-burning horticulture thriller comes from the name of a plant. Unfortunately, it's also the most intriguing character in the movie."
The Heartbreak Kid is a by-the-numbers romantic comedy whose every familiar plot contortion is easily predicted well before it occurs.
"This is, in fact, quite an ugly film."
"Usually, I like to align myself with out-there talents striving to make deeply personal works but in the case of Matthew Barney, this particular art-world emperor reveals himself to be naked and if he isn't ashamed, he probably should be."
Patches of it are so ludicrously hammy it plays like one of those unbearably corny fake films teased at the beginning of Tropic Thunder.
"A mess you just don't care for, and rarely understand..."
"a holy hot mess of digressions that tries to be all things to all people. A dash of social consciousness, a whiff of social commentary, and a heaping helping of cornpone family problems rendered with a broad brush and little insight"
"About as scary as a sock-puppet re-enactment of The Blair Witch Project, and not nearly as funny."
I would rather be stoned than have to watch Stoned.
"Nielsen, Chloe Sevigny and Gina Gershon shine, but ultimately this stylish yet dated arthouse feature is more confused than we are."
"It's too long, it's too dull, it's too lame."
&quot;I&apos;m a real boy&#33;&quot;&#10;&#46;&#46;&#46; and a piece of &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; movie&#46;
"The handling of the story and view of the humanity of the characters is challenging, but a tad disengaged to make the film's social commentary truly effective."
It comes up short in both plot and quality.
"A lot more of the same, although sporadically funny."
"The pre-teen cast seems rudderless, without an interested hand guiding them into worthwhile comedic performances."
"In ""JFK Revisited,"" Oliver Stone leads us through the looking glass, all right, but the real question is whether he's found the truth or an even more hypnotically spectacular lie."
"Most of the humor is just casual references to outrageous behavior, awkward sexual feelings among the cast, preening self-regard, utter cluelessness, and insecure anxiety of its characters, and slapstick."
"Considering the cast, those behind the camera, and the overall premise, this should have been a slam dunk both in terms of being emotionally involving and entertaining viewers. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)"
A singularly lumpy sort of movie.
"Despite some compelling performances, a potentially provocative exploration of medical ethics is compromised by melodramatic contrivances."
Demonstrates that a submarine movie needs some type of inventive subtext to keep it afloat and engaging.
Weird-stupid more than good-stupid ...
Merely an unnecessary (and mostly unsuccessful) footnote.
"Films, unlike airplanes, don't come with black boxes to reveal what went wrong, but there are some clues. Based on a book by the Sparks-like Charles Martin, this is a Nicholas Sparks film with a more expensive cast."
As flavorless and routine as they come.
A comedy hobbled by a preposterous plot and a phony finale.
The main point I can extract from Ethan Hawke's The Hottest State is that even a peevish and self-centered young man is capable of feeling great anguish when his girlfriend dumps him.
It interrogates&#44; with a certain episodic coarseness&#44; the dilemmas of love in the digital age of gender identity and intercultural diversity&#44; but in general its overall vision loses its dramatic potential&#46; &#91;Full review in Spanish&#93;
"Has wall-to-wall music and lots of eye candy, but very little else. It's a drag."
"A trio of noteworthy performances from Watts, Del Toro, and Penn is countered by lengthy, drawn-out, non-linear storytelling that guts the film's dramatic impact."
"Apart from its exhaustingly repetitive attention to the contrasting Ford and Neeson characters, the movie has virtually no interest in the secondary and tertiary characters whose heroism, jitters, sacrifice and suffering are at the heart of the story."
There is nothing to set this work apart from any number of mediocre Allen films.
It's about as enervating a way to waste 78 minutes as I've ever experienced.
Violent action sequel should've stayed buried.
Legal drama that's no more special or sophisticated than anything playing on TV these days.
A missed opportunity to use an isolated event to explore wider issues.
"A hunk of old Brie, left all day in the glove compartment in a car on a hot summer's day, could not smell more ripe than this absurd sword'n'sandal Roman movie."
"There's a Dumbledore, there's a Voldemort, there's a magical MacGuffin that our heroes must track down, but it's a soulless attempt to re-create the Potter magic."
&#8220;Bros&#8221; becomes muddled&#59; trapped between its critiques and its desires&#46;  It argues for a rejection of safe and easy&#44; but feels disingenuousness when it ignores its complicity in the palatable&#46; Bobby&apos;s annoyance overwhelms the romance and the comedy&#46;
The Words feels like a weaker Oprah Book Club selection that's been gussied up -- and edited to the bone -- for big-screen consumption.
"After an initially engrossing start, it stumbles through a series of implausible coincidences and murky events, barely held together by the magnetic performance of Javier Bardem."
"The royals whose wealth exceeds imagination are cloistered in bunkers that belong in a Francis Coppola Belizean spa, at least before pandemic demolished that industry. It's a very cool hotel to check into for a few minutes."
Polished but oddly lifeless heist thriller.
"Persepolis, despite its inventive and pleasing animation, drags on dully."
Get Hard is not only a bad movie but a profoundly wasted opportunity.
"It's a British rite-of-passage crime thriller, because it opens with a closeup of the protagonist's face and a voiceover that says ""That's me""."
"... sensationalizing real events for a meaningless film, then coasting on a huge budget and advertising to lure in moviegoers thinking they'll see historic accuracy and drama."
Call it a fixer-upper with potential.
Is the film a drama? Or a documentary? We're not sure.
"Philippe Lesage is presumably sympathetic to his main female character's plight, but his penchant for lingering tracking shots lends some of her scenes an unsettlingly voyeurism."
"There are enough pratfalls and purely physical comedy bits here to populate a Keystone Kops/Three Stooges double feature. While they're intermittently amusing, they don't really feel consistent with the rest of what Zhang is doing with the film."
"It's a shame that a project that on paper had the potential to be something interesting, turned out to be a movie so mediocre for a character who doesn't deserve that. [Full Review in Spanish]"
In the days since my rousing screening of the film I've grown increasingly mystified by it...
"It's not fun or carefree, it's just tacky - lost in a sea of clichés and contrivances that somehow makes even its fantastic music lose its appeal."
"""Take This Waltz"" not only does not work despite all of the aforementioned qualities, it doesn't work in such strange and inexplicable ways that I found myself more baffled than angry with it."
One to add to the list of recent films not worthy of Spacey's talents.
"This sort of visual jazziness lends a moderate amount of interest to a film that, in dramatic terms, remains both leaden and absurd."
Soggy theatrics render this gorgeously-shot underwater 3D excursion more shrill than thrilling.
A tedious and dull bore that's more mind-numbing than mind-fucking.
Moderately entertaining but droopy romance.
Not a complete waste but a questionable start to a franchise that doesn't need to be one.
[Brian DePalma] apparently considers ''money isn't everything'' an original and profound message.
The Expendables isn't as much fun as it should be.
A terminally dull piece of faith-based family-values filmmaking designed to appeal strictly to the converted.
"Scary Movie 2 isn't scary, funny-scary, or even just plain funny."
"Despite having an effective but shockingly-predictable computer-chat scene, The Pact didn't raise a single hair on the back of my neck."
"It's too long, too repetitive, and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner."
"Will future film historians, looking back, consider these CGI animal comedies to be the true horror movies of the 2000s?"
Feels like it is stuck in the late 1990s.
Even legends like Alfred Hitchcock and John Huston occasionally directed trifles... so it's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like Zhang Yimou behind the camera for a yarn that's ultimately rather inconsequential.
"We may have all been curious going in, but by the time the credits roll, there's another question that springs to mind: Is that all there is?"
"""Tideland"" is frustrating for the way it refuses to coalesce. You watch the film feeling abused and exploited, never knowing whether there's a bottom to this rabbit hole."
"Some will eagerly dig in, while others are likely to find it too sticky and overly rich."
"School of Rock got high and watched Harold and Kumar, and The Pick of Destiny was the story told to the cops upon waking up in the drive thru."
Many people leave. We stay end. Not sure why.
"In exactly 89 minutes, most of which passed as slowly as if I'd been sitting naked on an igloo, Formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey."
Tedious remake of the 1931 Wesley Ruggles version of Edna Ferber's classic.
"Bite worse than bark bulletproof beasts without benefit of steroids, species profiling, paw to paw beatdown staged like a World Wrestling Federation bout with fur, and the manimal who came to dinner."
"I'm not sure I'd ever want to see it again, but I'm not sorry I saw it once, even though I'm left with one burning question: Do they really keep a can of air freshener on hand in the War Room?"
"The finale is shockingly flat, everything petering out in such a forgettable and joyless manner the effect is frustrating."
"It will make no converts, nor will it push away the faithful. It's a Kevin Hart movie, after all."
"One is left longing for Hitchcock's dark, daring wit and disturbingly amoral insights."
"Visually elaborate, but dramatically flat"
The film only feels like two or three different sort of approaches are represented. They don't really feel like widely different attacks on the material.
I don't get the appeal to be honest.
Interesting but uneven.
Avoid at all costs.
"A loud, muddled and empty sci-fi thriller."
"The melodramatic machinations of Peter Kosminsky's well-intentioned chick flick White Oleander don't exactly come as surprise or a disappointment, but it ultimately fails to live up to promise of its all-star cast."
"[A] socially nutritious, unimpeachably competent, but shapeless and sluggish wartime drama about the little-known collaboration between North African immigrants and the French Resistance."
Would have been far more interesting if its titular talking head had debated an intellectual equal from the right.
"It's largely a rehash of the previous sleeper hit, ignoring the potential suggested by its subtitle."
"Fascination should make a bee line to Cinemax's late night lineup, where it belongs"
"Aronofsky has proven he can direct, so what to make of the fact that this film is so hateful and vile?"
"It's the franchise that nobody wanted, featuring characters that nobody cares about and starring an actor who struggles with the basics of the craft."
"Both American AND French cultures get shortsighted, religious and political moirs into fidelity are brushed away and the film shifts from melodrama to farce to tragedy and back to comedy (using that term lightly) at the drop of a razor."
"Every incident mentioned in the film was reported in the media, sometimes ad nauseam, and the polls show that about half of Americans like where things are going."
Whatever Works is a slapdash composition built around a single note.
"Despite a pair of spectacular characterizations by Mel Gibson and Robert Downey Jr., the film version of Dennis Potter's BBC miniseries plays a little offkey."
"An insipid story transmitted to the screen, it seems, only to allow Drew and Steve to show what they've got."
"The fun is supposed to come in watching people's reactions, but punking innocent bystanders is both too easy and mean-spirited."
...much of the movie is a thin vehicle for homages to the foreign-film greats that Shawn's windbag character endlessly compares to arriviste Garrel.
"[A]s the storm worsens and the feats of superhuman strength required to extricate themselves from the situation become more pronounced, the film loses whatever B-movie purity its premise may have promised."
"Hardcore, but also heavily flawed action flick. Johnson seems to be playing a supporting role in his own movie."
"The Wretched (written and directed by brothers Brett Pierce and Drew Pierce) devolves into an incoherent mess in the last 20 minutes of the film, thereby wasting the potential that it had in the beginning of the story."
"[Director Theo Anthony's] approach is formal, poetic, and associative, but ultimately thin, strained, and incoherent."
"While drawing a straight line back to John Carpenter's original might be a neat trick, except perhaps for those who are a lot more invested in the franchise than this critic admittedly is, it's not much of a treat."
[It] doesn't conjure up much of a spark here; it's more bombast than lean...
"If Slade's intent is so clever, then why is the film so stupid as to hamfist a two-hour anti-pedophilia PSA down the throats of an entire culture that, by and large, already agrees with the premise...?"
"While its story moves forward in a way that makes sense, Du Welz's pacing is too slow and too choppy for the movie to build up much momentum."
The Rent-like ensemble of yearning young people at the center of the story is a drag; I wanted to turn the sound down on them and say rude things.
"Your Highness is what you expect it to be, except it's not nearly as funny as you'd want it to be."
Disengaged silly spoof of those '70s disaster movies.
First-time filmmaker Amanda Kernell does a superb job of establishing the central character and her rural environs...
"If Scream was like a funny joke, Scream 2 was like somebody telling you, 'here's how I heard that joke,' and Scream 3 is like somebody who won't believe you've already heard it."
"Not the most compelling tale, not compellingly told."
"By the time Martin begins waving around a gigantic American flag to rally his supporters for one last clash, the film has become so mechanical and jingoistic you might just as well be watching ""Declaration of Independence Day."""
Actually being stuck in a remote waterlogged grotto might be more tolerable than enduring this disaster of an adventure movie.
[Rhys-Meyers's performance is] the perfect microcosm for the entire film: capable but bland.
"The new Terminator movie is much better than the last three Terminator movies, if you remember them. Which you may not. It doesn't matter."
"There just isn’t enough juice behind the stagecraft. The Scream movies have thrived because they’ve always stayed one step ahead of their source material -- but as the franchise grows more bloated, they risk becoming their own punch line."
Only the 13-and-under set will buy into the Confessions vision of teen-hood. Most actual teens have already noted the lack of opportunities for air-guitar montages.
"Buscemi delivers game and spry and pleasurable work, but writer-director Hue Rhodes drops him into a mess of a film and lets him dangle helpless and alone."
"Schwentke inexplicably employs quick-cut, shaky closeups that deny viewers the satisfaction of clean compositions."
"Given Besson's career-long affinity for visual flash and breathless storytelling, it's especially disappointing that The Lady is so ordinary."
"The movie is a jumbled mess that never really comes alive, and in the end may feel like something of an endurance test."
An Oscar-caliber cast and dazzling visual effects can't rescue this formulaic disaster flick from a script flooded with generic dialogue and preposterous plot points.
"Like the snow-covered mountains that form a backdrop to much of Shivaay, the film may have been meant to inspire awe, but the end result leaves you stone cold."
[T]he issue is that with gags so mile-a-minute -- and a pace so blindingly fast -- Teen Titans exhausts even an 84-minute runtime.
"So tired and over-familiar, even the basic supernatural ingredients fail to cohere in the engaging and spine-chilling way that they should."
"The picture trivializes the characters, hinting at depths it can't depict, aiming at a profundity of feeling it can't begin to reach."
"Despite Gervais's considerable creative input, The Invention of Lying is not very good. It seems stuck in strange limbo, torn between a desire to be both hip and cutting-edge and be a quality piece of accessible mainstream entertainment."
"Director Pierre Perifel opts for far too many manic action sequences, all of them done in such a hyperactive manner that theyre likely to cause seizures."
A thriller with an intriguing premise undermined by flawed execution. It might have been better to let it remain in audio format.
It is as tacky and hacky and dispiritingly cheap in the means of its manipulation as any American slasher film I've seen.
Sinks under the weight of its ever more inescapably apparent contrivance.
"Shimizu may have sold out and bastardized his own calling card, but at least he got the ghost hand thing in again."
Chilling but unrealistic stalker film.
You might despise the 'Twilight' series and still find something to appreciate here...at least it's original.
"If it weren't for the presence of De Niro and Pacino, this would be just another generic straight-to-DVD police drama. It would probably star Tim Daly and Stephen Baldwin."
"Mother is competent, no more, no less."
"[A] run-of-the-mill threequel, delivering occasional bursts of preposterous, tongue-in-cheek fun but nowhere, nowhere near enough."
"Yes, Cloud Atlas is massively ambitious, and impressive. But as it labours to clarify its own confusion, mapping every last nook of narrative space, any sense of real mystery is obliterated by platitudes about freedom."
"Like the gags, many of the cameos don't pack a whole lot of punch, but enough succeed so that the viewer leaves with a mildly favorable impression. Regrettably, this is probably more a function of human psychology than moviemaking skill."
[Arnold] acquits himself well and seems to bring his own life of troubles with him in these latter performances. But this film is pretty relentlessly bleak without a whole lot to say about any of the proceedings.
"At a time when the public is burned out on political divisiveness and media oversaturation, the last thing moviegoers are likely going to want is two hours of film showing them how we got to such a national low point."
"This isn't your usual road thriller, however. When you least expect it, the cast breaks into sexy, MTV-style musical numbers that may or may not have something to do with the plot."
"""Final Destination"" meets ""Saw"" meets disaster."
"There are some laugh-out-loud moments in Daddy's Home, but there are more scenes that will have you rolling your eyes so much, you might give yourself a headache."
"Greenland never comes together into a truly satisfying package, but it deserves a little credit for trying to do something unique within such a familiar framework."
"Hey, wait a minute, is the movie supposed to be this funny?"
"Boasts a remarkable amount of clever and inventive sexual metaphors, and a few eccentric characters that mask the lackluster, stereotypical illustrations."
"All that matters here are cockamamie anachronistic music cues, low-rent filmmaking and one spectacularly hammy turn from Russell Crowe."
"Whereas there was savage beauty and irony in the '60-'70s violence of Penn, Peckinpah, and Leone, the coda of 'Django Unchained' is mere benumbing splatter."
"A major dud - a picture that isn't smart, isn't fun, and is really just a great big waste of time."
"The principle behind the humor in ""The Watch"" seems to be: When in doubt, mention testicles."
"Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered."
"This dud is such a yawn, not even Big Brother is watching."
"Unlikely to be remembered in decades to come - or even in months to come, once the next teenage dystopian fantasy inserts itself into movie houses."
Pugh and Harbour are a delight in the midst of a film that is nothing more than ordinary in yet another typical super hero film.
"The comic and romantic payoffs are limp, and the picture wanders on past its climax."
This Crank sequel fails to live up to the original in every way and that one didn't exactly set a high bar to begin with.
One of the lousiest and tedious science fiction entries of the late nineties...
"What the movie is though is boring, senseless, choppy and undeveloped. This is a biggest letdown of 2017. A waste of a top name talent."
Dark Bullock deja-vu thriller won't interest kids.
"Special mention must be made of Bryce Dallas Howard, who takes a swing at the Manic Pixie Dream Girl role and hits a stand-up double; it's not exactly a good performance, but it briefly energizes a moribund movie."
Every Republican regime gets the ludicrous devious-baby saga it deserves.
"The Bad Batch has enough flashy, fashionably grim accessories and accoutrements to fill a Hot Topic."
"Brettkelly's film is too polite to treat this milieu, rarefied to the point of being ridiculous, with anything other than intricately embroidered kid gloves."
"A clumsily written, surprisingly foolish and misdirected adaptation."
"I used to love the animated series, but I do remember that every episode had pretty much the same story and the movie follows suit."
There's really no suspense in this bright red bucket of sap. We know what happens to our unlikely hero on a professional level: He gets famous.
"Roe and Rothe are nice enough to look at, but together, there's no spark, and separate, little evidence of an interior life."
"A Dirty Shame is outrageous for the sake of being outrageous, but unlike some of Waters' other films, it's neither shocking nor funny."
"A movie that's creepy and truly suspenseful in some places, unintentionally comic or plain awful in others."
There are bits of poetry and flickering wit that grace Petit's passage into an ebullient boor and bore.
It's not really worth sinking your time and money into. This movie is more floundering than fun.
"As far as holiday films go this is perfect for lightening the holiday hangover, but ultimately it's equal parts onerous and energetic, overreaching in its attempt not buckle under the weight of previous iterations."
"The stuff that happens is altogether messy in its assemblage, but at least Ayer makes certain to keep it speeding at us quickly."
"It’s simply that I only wanted the first of the three movies on tap here, and was very tired by the time it was over..."
So why did the master of 21st-century transgressive French cinema make such a tame and sentimental film? I think it's because he had nowhere else to go after making three really great and extreme films.
This is an evident step backwards with respect to the previous title of its director (Frantz). [Full review in Spanish]
"A plot that makes no sense, characters that are barely there, and a denouement that is an insult to everybody's intelligence, all combine to make Penn's action-man debut fire blanks."
"What was originally a bonkers and sententious parable about class, labour, and the horrors of the meat industry-run by a race of talking antelope-like beings from another planet-is now essentially an abstract coming-of-age picture."
"It'll be a miracle if the movie isn't a hit but my guess is that, upon seeing it, only the very rare viewer will give thanks."
"Like many unmemorable college-set slashers, the film becomes all about how the deaths might one-up each other in gruesomeness."
Payne is uncharacteristically constipated when it comes to securing the whimsy and potent dramatic undercurrent of the material.
Some movies need a suspension of disbelief. Simone requires a suspension bridge.
Paint conjures a portrait of mixed-bag moments&#46; Some areas of its canvas are brimming with promise&#44; but the whole experience struggles to paint a satisfying and cohesive picture&#46; 
"It's a visually impressive but emotionally tin-eared trawl over that oft-scraped indie film territory, the soulless suburban landscape."
"It's funny and violent and occasionally quite entertaining, even if there's not a single convincing moment."
Feels like the Cliffs notes version of a gripping book.
In the end it's all too fast and too furious -- and far too obsessed with exercising its license to thrill.
...an utterly disappointing misfire.
There&apos;s not much wrong with this film on paper&#8212;there&apos;s just something wrong with the execution&#46;
"For now, [Allen] has given up making films that are about anything bigger than a quirky theme and a few dozen one-liners."
"These ideas are more prevalent than ever, which tends to horribly date Alphaville against its more thought-out successors like A Clockwork Orange and Blade Runner."
Another depressing dispatch from the war between the sexes by James Toback.
How do you have Matthew Broderick looking uncomfortable doing physical comedy when physical comedy and wit are his gifts?
"Ten years ago this month, the Marvel universe was launched with the fresh, lively, relatively easygoing ""Iron Man."" It seems more like 100."
"A beloved tale, then – but in Zemeckis’s hands, a cold, flat, witless and astoundingly odd affair... the entire fiasco looks and sounds like a cheap and charmless pantomime."
"Even the most talentless and narcissistic fame seekers on reality television are not nearly as vile, reprehensible or worthless as a film that actively wishes harm on them."
"Beyond the gratuitous cruelty, the slavering misogyny and the all-too-expected childish sadism of the final scenes of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, what really struck me, walking out as the credits rolled, was just how let down I felt."
"Honestly titled if nothing else, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a sluggish also-ran compared to its predecessor, 2011's retirement-themed comedy-drama The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel."
pointless nihilism
A clumsily condensed mystery/thriller novel made into a movie that offers little more than every other clumsily condensed mystery/thriller novel made into a movie.
A litany of embarrassments best left shielded from audiences.
Tepid Eddie Murphy political farce.
"The Vatican Tapes - a generic and uncreative horror entry that fails to inspire, move or frighten."
"Zoom cameos from a few stars and a heist storyline add a bit of zest, but you still may want to free yourself long before the end credits."
All of it feels haphazardly assembled.
"What Maze gains in its depiction of history, it loses in emotional strength."
Verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies.
The characters are clichés and the plot is assembly-line predictable.
"Overlong, repetitive, too simplistic, and bland despite oodles of breathtaking scenery. It's like a healthy dish that looks aesthetically pleasing, but lacks flavor and needs a more talented chef."
"Without Diesel, there's not much gas, at least not from the nonvehicular elements."
"If SKYFALL was the film to make old-school Bond retro and acceptable rather than passe and anachronistic, then SPECTRE embraces it wholeheartedly. As entertaining as SKYFALL was (and SPECTRE is at times), it seems you reap what you sow."
The utter excess of it all -- from gloriously bad wigs to obviously CGI-enhanced action scenes -- is entertaining in all the wrong ways.
While technically proficient&#44; the films end result is a poorly executed message that succumbs to standard hostage movie tropes&#46; 
I felt not the smallest stir of emotion when the film revealed which of the good-natured ruffians would become which fabled knight.
You won't be missing much if you can't keep your calendar open for this lightweight comedy.
"Step Brothers touches inspired insanity intermittently, it never stays put, resulting in a picture of pleasing bedlam, but never consistent bedlam."
"In the end, it seems to be much ado about nothing very much, despite the pleasing performances and scenery."
Dear Eugene Levy: Please consider me as a qualified candidate for the position of your agent.
McTiernan and the talent-deprived buffoons who wrote the remake took away the futurism and stripped most of the social satire from this cautionary tale.
"While Rapace remains a strong and captivating actress in the title role, the film is remarkably bad. In fact, it's easily one of the year's worst movies. Boring beyond belief."
"Rather than consider how someone like Terry Gilliam [think ""Brazil""] might approach Thurber's socially ripe source material, they have merely imposed a formulaic script that still doesn't hit its marks."
"Nancy Myers' feminist discourse feels outdated, the movie is too long and doesn't really explore the themes it presents. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Those who care will find it tough to reconcile the Kyle in the movie with the reality; others will find it a familiar, occasionally moving, but ultimately directionless peek through the crosshairs at the personal costs of war."
"Spencer itself is only a half-bad movie, promoting idolatry for a public that has lost respect for tradition and that has no sense of duty or sense of occasion."
Director Joel Schumacher is probably the only man alive these days who could make a nuclear bomb rattling around New York City in a briefcase into a boring idea.
Atmospheric and beautifully shot but ultimately empty and meaningless...
"Linder possesses a compelling, Kurt Cobain-like androgyny, but neither she nor Krill can do much to save the portentous screenplay."
"Yes, I know grief does strange things to people, and sex can be a way of expressing that distress, but making it the focus of Kidman's performance just seems forced and dramatically pointless."
"A baggy, laboured rehash that, at 123 minutes, lumbers on for an eternity."
A therapy-session breakthrough posing as a franchise reboot.
The admittedly good-spirited story rambles like a guy telling a long joke that doesn't have a punch line.
"The film creates a hypnotic atmosphere, but ends up looking like a product too tailored for the cult movie fan. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Whether or not you think Crowley's very of-its-moment piece still has something to say to audiences of the 21st century, it's a play that deserves better than this waxwork karaoke."
"Listening to one of Smith's speaking engagements would be a much more entertaining way for a fan to spend 115 minutes, and non-fans or fence-sitters will likely find this piece too puffy to be very useful."
"A sort of CliffsNotes version of the Theodor Geisel children's book, with simplistic CGI, Day-Glo color palette and a pounding score."
Is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets?
"Between the middling visual effects and the incoherent story, this oddity doesn't have enough adrenaline-fueled action to satisfy kiddos nor enough narrative logic to please adults."
Harlin and Davis don't seem to realize that the results aren't refreshingly revisionist - they're eye-avertingly embarrassing.
"A long, blood-splattered stunt of a movie, Grindhouse, may be something only critics and film nerds can love."
I hated every 149 minutes. This is so bad it's immoral. Michael Bay is a time-sucking vampire who will feast off your lost time. This is why the movie is so long.
It's almost as if everyone involved in Set Fire To The Stars got a little too understated for their own good.
"The Jackass guys, goaded on again by fearless leader Johnny Knoxville and director Jeff Tremaine, don't seem as eager to outrage as they once were."
"In Hellboy II, director Guillermo del Toro delivers the Hollywood filet mignon we've come to expect wrapped nicely in all the special-effects bacon we've come to desire but without the heart we've come to demand."
"Just a nugget of truth doesn't amount to a true gold rush. Whether or not you believe in the ""true story"" on which this film is ""based,"" that real-life backstory is more titillating than its cinematic dybbuk dramatization."
A predictable rom-com that is barely saved by the charisma of its leading couple&#46; &#91;Full Review in Spanish&#93;
The anachronistic feminism of Rosaline doesn&#8217;t just ring false - it can barely be heard at this point&#44; over the riot grrl din of past remixed Shakespeare heroines in 10 Things I Hate About You and She&#8217;s The Man&#46;
The jokes come thick but not fast before the sorry mess is put to bed with a dreadfully soppy ending.
"Centigrade eventually becomes a ""what else awful can happen"" experience, when it should be about how much more the characters can endure."
"Any film starring the self-regarding, teak-veneered charisma vacuum that is Matthew McConaughey has more to overcome than most. So the fact that the rom-com Dickens riff Ghosts of Girlfriends Past is even sporadically entertaining is no mean feat."
"Stories built around a mystery can have a difficult time creating a satisfying answer, and this picture is no exception ..."
Basically it's Frost/Nixon to Dross/Vixen. And there's plenty to be ashamed of.
"If you like cliches, you'll love Annapolis."
