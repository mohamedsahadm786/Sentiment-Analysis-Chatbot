Henry Selick’s first movie since 2009’s Coraline. His fifth stop-motion masterpiece.
"Creed II does not give us anything but another, slightly superior Rocky sequel. It wins on points. Just don't expect a knockout."
"I know what you're thinking, but this is no Limitless (Bradley Cooper). As the cells multiply and Lucy taps into more and more of her brain, it's new thrills-new skills with each passing hour."
"Director Fernando Meirelles tells the story with urgency, and his sharp visual compositions and washed out cinematography ooze gangster life."
"""Kajillionaire"" is a rich piece of storytelling, and it feels like a kajillion bucks."
A heartfelt story with a lovely performance from Scott Chambers.
If a bit long for a cartoon feature -- probably a sign that its makers fell in love with it -- Ratatouille is the eighth and one of the best Pixar features.
"Anchored by a charming performance from Greta Gerwig, it's as light and breezy as a walk in Central Park, and just as refreshing."
"It's largely a Hanks solo show, and the beloved icon is in fine, unfussy form."
"It is not one of those family films that will delight both children and adults alike. However, the kids will find it to be entertaining enough."
"The Amazing Johnathan Documentary is ingeniously constructed, a hilarious thrill ride and the underdog story of the year."
A little more conflict and less beatification would have made for a more insightful film.
"13 Assassins is reliably entertaining, but ultimately it's too traditional to be a classic."
The brown-bag movie of the year: Sneak in a bottle of something bitter and cheap (to match the central characters) and get smashed along with the onscreen relationship.
The quirky script is packed with good lines and off-the-wall moments and the stories are surprisingly moving in places.
"It is a model of dignified, delicate restraint but there are times when it seems to suffocate under the weight of its own sumptuous respectability."
The picture fires on all pistons.
I highly recommend you check this out on the big screen.
"Oh it's fun. An old-fashioned, good-hearted action film with a sense of humor."
"Despite its downbeat theme, A Single Man is ultimately optimistic about the human capability to gradually make peace with seemingly insurmountable pain and tragedy."
"Hersh's intelligent style turns a dialogue-heavy, potentially rote film into an enthralling and moving experience."
"It's too bad the movie never quite sweeps us up - it's slow in spots, and there's an awful lot of exposition."
What could easily have become its own figurative image of the masculine longing for freedom mines far deeper concerns.
"Mank isn’t about the incredibly tedious question of who wrote Citizen Kane —that’s the hook, but the film’s true interest, to my immense relief, is the incredibly specific story of Upton Sinclair’s failed 1934 California gubernatorial bid."
A sterling supporting cast -- down to the tiniest bit parts -- provides enough astringent intelligence to make the slobbering sentimentality go down with ease.
Enthusiastically acted and sharply written. A big old lovefest in honor of the classic alien visitation movies that we all hold near and dear.
"The Assistant is a must see, not just because it relates to the behaviour of everyone within the workplace, but because it does so without the need to preach."
It's hard to see how anyone wouldn't be absorbed by this fascinating film about a formidable driver and man.
"The Hate U Give features a strong and incredibly moving performance from Amandla Stenberg, who never holds anything back from the audience and never overplays a moment. She's a star in the making."
The film feels equally drawn out despite the bursts of black humour and the emotional depth of Fan's performance.

A seriously quirky piece of work...
An eye-opener that focuses on world-shaking events and makes you feel like you are there.
"Reenactments in documentaries are always a tricky business, but here, they feel necessary. The staged scenes communicate just how visceral mountaineering can be."
"Here, merriment and melancholy go hand in hand, partners in life's dance just as a stiff drink is an accompaniment to life's pleasures. The combination proves as intoxicating as the fancy-pants cocktails the boys whip up together."
"Even though we know the outcome...the campaign progress remains enthralling. Mostly because it's a fascinating snapshot of modern politics in flux...and a hopeful, ultimately moving account of idealism in action."
"The brothers Coen deliver a taut, vastly entertaining dissertation on the imbalance of life."
"Time to Leave blows a fresh, skeptical wind through fairly corny melodramatic territory while keeping faith with the operatic emotions of the genre."
Mild sedative filled with a good run of giggles and the frightening aim of the A-list cast. Nancy Meyers would be wise to keep corralling this type of acting pedigree. It makes her merlot-stained screenplays more palatable than they have any right to be.
A film worth seeing.
"It's a warm, if pallid, romantic comedy that may not do much more to burnish Lopez's reputation, but will certainly not bruise it."
It'll keep the kids entertained for a while and give their parents a chuckle or two along the way.
"It's a worthwhile showcase for Pacino, whose thoughtful portrayal of a washed-up stage actor is both contemplative and darkly comical."
"A stylish, frisky film that sets up the franchise deftly"
"It's a prettified view of love, for sure, but as Sox fans would surely attest, sometimes fairy tale dreams do come true."
"Beast is a strikingly shot, cleverly scripted, unsettling study of troubled psychology in the pressure-cooker claustrophobia of a small island."
"Highly recommended. In a world where the Best Animated Feature Oscar were not basically owned by Disney and Dreamworks, it would be a deserving champion."
"Inside Out's brainy script is matched both by its visual splendor, often invoking the spirit of Miyazaki, and its humanist reach, which extends to both family and (imaginary) friend alike."
"It is not a light movie (as the trailers might suggest), but it's a unique, refreshing one, driven by remarkable performances from Shawkat and Costa."
Remember the name Shohreh Aghdashloo ... she is the soul of this pungent film.
"This is a gorgeous, sweeping entertainment that combines the epic - a rain-whipped ascent through muddy hills is particularly awe-inspiring - with the intimate and the offbeat."
"A feminist chant that's necessary and relevant, a film about female empowerment and their roles in society, the work place and as human beings. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Even when the movie loses its way narratively, Washington's in there, slugging, building a living, breathing character out of Gilroy's knight-errant."
Bong Joon Ho dazzles your senses and infects your mind with a delicious concoction of artful entertainment that delivers a poignant cinematic experience. [Full review in Spanish]
"""American Sniper"" is crammed with action, heart-pounding moments and incredible gunshots by Cooper. But Eastwood seems distracted by his need to make a patriotic film more than a desire to show the real ramifications of so much killing."
"Given it could be re-titled 'Microaggressions: The Movie', this is an unsurprisingly upsetting watch at times, but it's made compelling by Vega's dignified, heartfelt performance."
"The drinks and their consumption look mighty glamorous in ""Hey Bartender,"" Douglas Tirola's tidy and ingratiating documentary ode to high-end mixologists."
"In its own, weird way it resonates, even after a story that some will see as silly and an ending that teeters on gimmicky."
"Pledge is (sometimes frustratingly) ambiguous ... I have to give it credit, though. It's a scrappy little thriller that kept me entertained and enthralled the entire time."
A travelogue with teeth.
"""Don't Look Up"" is no ""Dr. Strangelove"" in achieving lasting political satire brilliance, but it does mirror the times in which it was produced."
"Clarke's specialties are anger and violence, and he captures them with a brutal precision that belies the inherent messiness of the action."
Phil is not a challenging film but it is funny and often sweet.
"""No Time to Die"" is a terrific movie: an up-to-the-minute, down-to-the-wire James Bond thriller with a satisfying neo-classical edge."
... Guédiguian punctures a lot of myths about the face-and the motives-of the French resistance.
"A fascinating, surprisingly funny and extremely moving new documentary about the Apollo space program that really does have the right stuff."
"The Naked Gun is still very funny more than 20 years later. Leslie Nielsen is awesome, and the gags are more hit than miss."
An emotional film that connects with the audience and resembles those epic films full of sentimentalism. [Full review in Spanish]
"Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly."
"Jennifer Garner, in her first romantic comedy, sparkles in this must-see date film."
Tends to get bogged down in an over-abundance of characters and plot developments but does produce enough twists that you never feel cheated by the outcome.
It's almost immediately immersive to be here again... even if it ultimately feels like three quarters of a very good movie chopped off from a whole.
"Set in a place where the American Dream has been dead for so long that no one even thinks to question its loss, the picture features terrific performances from its game cast."
"An appealing comedy with an unabashed streak of melodrama, sharp dialogue, and a superb ensemble cast, anchored by a lead performance by Al Pacino in lovable scamp mode."
... extremely entertaining. [Full review in Spanish]
"In certain circles, it won't be for anyone. But it's as unusual and enigmatic a piece of cinema as you're likely to see this year."
"It's about a boy and his dog, and also about firefighters, and so I don't see how it's possible not to have warm feelings toward it."
"In most years, Naomi Watts would be a shoo-in for an Oscar nomination with a performance that is absolutely mesmerizing and emotionally devastating."
"A morbid, awkward, raucously funny critique of modern life."
As Leopold ... Jackman is the perfect mix of rogue and gentleman.
"A carefully constructed ride of anxiety, in which characters suffer under the voyeuristic eye of the audience and of society as a whole."
"Whatever your take on Showgirls going in, McHale's film will add new layers to it, and make you want to re-watch this fabulously bizarre flop-turned-classic with more questioning eyes."
"An ""edge"" of your seat thriller, perfect for cinephiles who find these moments of our past scintillating."
"It is such a cute movie. It's so adorable, so funny, so sweet. It's corny, but not overwhelmingly corny. It so works."
"Beautifully executed, and marks an impressive debut from Ahn."
"...Drive My Car suggests that, with the right combination of people riding together, you may be able to arrive, intact, somewhere special."
"If your tolerance for envelope-pushing crudeness and deadpan delirium allows it, this crass comedy might be just what the gastroenterologist ordered."
"The magic of “Matilda” is still strong today, and the message it sends out (“You are not alone”) is something we all need to continue to hear."
"...a sunny recollection of an 80's childhood, and specifically a love story between a boy and his aging grandmother, Minari is a feel-good movie with heart..."
Garcia delivers a nerve-jangling tour de force tryout that will be appreciated by out-of-work actors for years to come.
Bound to become THE family entertainment choice for the holiday season. It's a blockbuster. Deal with it.
Downey charms the heck out of the opportunity he's given.
Director Kevin Asch shows a skilled hand that belies his tyro status. He moves the story along briskly and to the point and gets solid performances from his talented cast.
"What to do when a relatively small, modest budgeted urban comedy becomes a massive critical and word-of-mouth hit? Make a sequel to cash in on the phenomenon, of course. It is the Hollywood way, after all..."
"A film that is oh-so enchanting and charming thanks to eye-popping visuals, perfect voice casting and a fantastical story for all ages."
A sinister tapestry of urban unease and feminist fury that turns an ordinary domestic setting into a place of skulking terror. Original and deeply creepy.
Jia Zhangke creates atmospheres and images of great poetic breath that are full of suggestive power and meaning. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Truly romantic movies seem to be a rarer and rarer thing in contemporary cinema and, like Max Ophüls and Jacques Demy before him, Wright is almost peerless in his ability to make an audience swoon and suffer in maximalist splendor."
"Long, lyrical takes - including a startling shot of a floating funeral procession - and Schubert's 'Death And The Maiden' on the soundtrack remind us that forbidden passion will only end in tears. The Danube's rarely seemed so blue."
"In the main, Jaume Collet-Serra is making a character-driven drama about betrayed honor, and the result is a film closer in spirit to the baggage-rich crime novels of Dennis Lehane than dumb multiplex fare."
"It might not be perfect, but this ""Papillon"" definitely has wings."
"A charming, quietly satisfying work, Adam is a commendable film. Sensitively written and directed by Mayer, it's given shape and dimensionality by Dancy, who delivers a tremendous performance that lends the film genuine humanity."
"Thrillingly paced, ravishingly shot and eerily topical, Sicario 2 retains much of its predecessor's dark charm despite its shuffled creative personnel. But a jarringly Hollywood ending dulls its overall impact."
"Hall, making his feature debut, rarely strays from the underdog sports movie template, but the two appealing young leads come as a welcome blast of deodorant to this stale narrative armpit."
"Mary and The Witch's Flower is a colorful and visually stunning spectacle, a film that packs plenty of detail within its frames."
"In truth, mother! can be about whatever you want it to, making it one of those rare films that you can appreciate without actually having to enjoy any second..."
"It's a fierce performance, not because Rodriguez is a seasoned actress -- she's not -- but because she brings such a magnificent, 'prove-it-to-me' snarl to the role."
The script is elegant and the performances are dignified.
The Hughes Brothers have wisely leapt out of their niche by doing this project -- From Hell is a terrific thriller.
"Will lights and hardware be ready? Can they afford the $200K demanded by headliner Rihanna? The viewer's pulse may rise, too, as Rossi's camera roams frantic hallways, offices and limos."
The infamous butt-chugging scene - will do for audiences what the pie-humping scene in American Pie did for the comedy genre.
"Shannon conveys the contract killer's utter detachment from humanity, providing a mute but menacing presence that wastes few words or emotions."
"The Do-Over is a throwback to classic Adam Sandler films and, while ridiculous, is still a fun ride."
"While it's all so breezy and zippy and girl-power peppy, it's Keaton who makes Mad Money worth a few bucks."
"Rather than tell us that everything we know about Oz is wrong, the filmmakers take what we already know about the wonderful wizard and thread it into a tale about the magic behind cinema itself."
"The best thing about Millions is the freckled, open-faced seriousness of young Etel's Damian, a kid whose faith in goodness can't be bought."
"Like many a meal, the lives of these characters don't necessarily turn out as planned, but the surprises are what provide the extra flavor and delight."
It's an airy confection of delight that is at the same time wised-up and nostalgic. And it aims for a vision of moviemaking that is rhapsodic and earnest without being sentimental.
"As a rugged yet wise exploration of manhood and mortality, All Is Lost gives great Hemingway."
"This is no classic, but director James Wan is a deft conductor who orchestrates the scariest ride of the season from threads of familiarly black melodies."
Jenkins&apos; handling of Chiron&apos;s sexuality is as quietly oblique as everything else in the film&#46;
Another 1990s media spectacle gets a long-overdue autopsy in this slick and riveting documentary.
"A cleverly made combination of mystery, drama and thriller which succeeds due to the rapport between Walker and Glackin."
"[Melville's] style remains haunting and elegantly spare, just right for the kind of hit man who lives in silence, in bare and colorless surroundings, with a lonely caged bird."
It's probably the best cartoon that the studio has released since Mulan.
This is a better story than the platitude that it seems to build up to in the final scene. But it was not all the film it could have been if Zemeckis would have realized where his best material lay.
"A perfect date movie with more stars than script appeal... it's contrived and predictable, although there are a couple of surprises"
So what if the front story is a little contrived?
Hedges wraps up a tremendous year with another powerful gut-punch of a performance.
"George has constructed a fine dramatic feature, and a good first step to educating the masses on this disturbing event."
"Across the board, the performances are terrific: superbly understated and fabulously real."

Zombie proves once again that he understands how many different ways there are to give an audience the creeps.
"Although it’s difficult to place much faith in what she says about herself, there are interesting insights here in terms of what she says about the experience of life within the Daesh state more generally."
Everything played well for me.
"The film eclipses its conceit, delicately examining both the unique pain that is the loss of intimacy and what makes us fall in love with someone again and again."
"Overall, 'Solo: A Star Wars Story' is a great time at the cinema and really gives Han Solo the spotlight he deserves."
"Morgan's sometimes weird, sometimes whimsical thriller delivers a grown-up blend of film-noir tropes and deadpan humor, for a comedy-drama which starts off lighthearted and then deftly darkens."
"Bergman Island thrums in silence, so it loses steam when, during the second half of the film, reality and fiction begin to explicitly mix. [Full review in Spanish]"
"""On the Beach"" feels more raw and personal than some of Mr. Hong's other work."
Thorough and essential.
"A reminder that Gondry is as brooding as he is silly, even when making an outlier like 'Microbe & Gasoline.'"
Excellent option if you want more than entertainment from... two hours of cinema. [Full review in Spanish]
The Hustle doesn't have a grand message and it doesn't need one. It's two top-notch comedians trying to steal the movie from one another. They both win.
"The film moves on the strength of its aesthetic wonder, almost as if you are watching a feature film made entirely of Tumblr-based gifs and mood boards."
"Skate culture remains in solid hands with filmmaker Stacy Peralta, who fashions his most personal doc on the sport-cum-lifestyle."
"F. Gary Gray's excellent film is as sympathetic as it is bombastic, even when it depicts some of the rough stuff, a lot of the stupid excesses that come with fame, and even some quasi-criminal activities."
"A powerful tale of bravery, compassion and resilience, The Cave is a remarkable film."
A sober and impecable tale. [Full review in Spanish]
[Huppert] manages to make Hansen-Løve's sometimes flat writing come alive at the right moments.
"A fun, energetic caper that tries hard to make you love its characters, but mostly fails to succeed.."
"Though Penn's sympathies lie with McCandless, the director's camera is impassive, and the film's driving intent is to doggedly document rather than celebrate."
Save for two sequences where Sony Pictures' take on the jacket-wearing hopper mirrors Beatrix Potter's ... the film operates between fourth and fifth gears.
The actors' hammy performances only compound the amusement of watching a dynasty propped up by largesse fall to pieces at the very thought of actually having to earn their way in life.
"(Writer-director Patrick) Wang's deliberate, naturalistic style proves to be both a strength and a weakness. In the final analysis, the overall timeliness of Wang's storyline as well as the film's lack of sentimentality is of considerable value."
"Alas, the out-on-the-town portion of the movie is less engaging, although if you're a Smiths fan you can happily rock out to the greatest-hits soundtrack, which has everything from the title track to Panic, Girl Afraid and How Soon Is Now."
The performances are great from top-to-bottom...this was a movie that probably should have been on the big screen.
"It's nervy stuff for any filmmaker but especially one who loves to imbue a sense of melancholy amid the hopeless. For Nightmare Alley, there is no sweet, only bitter."
"A confidently handled, promisingly edgy feature debut...Winter Brothers dribbles into obfuscation its closing stages but has already confirmed Palmason and company as names to watch."
Ozon knows his female characters like few others. [Full review in Spanish]
...a high concept premise that's employed to somewhat bloated yet predominantly entertaining effect by Badham...
As much a loving homage to the horror genre as it is a lament for a civilization on the brink.
"Amin's story is so thick with drama, terror and bloodshed, why create a fictional character to serve as a vantage point?"
"It's a gorgeous, thoughtful, well-acted, morally complex and adult-skewing character study from a major studio. Warts and all, it's exactly what we say Hollywood never bothers to make."
"Joseph Hader breathes life into his role with a raw, understated performance that somewhat compensates for the screenplay's lack of emotional depth."
"It rollicks along with a lot of help from the songs, which lift the spirits as well as lending pace to the plot but the insistence of the message-making means Cinderella and her Prince fall short of making magic together."
"'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness' clearly bears the fingerprints of director Sam Raimi, who infuses the material with the same trippy, giddy spirit which has guided his best work."
English film that powerfully and practically speaks to the communal dimension of our responsibility to the natural world.
"Eggers has solidified his legacy as a wonderful director and there are no doubts, he will be making movies, possibly even Oscar worthy ones, for many years to come."
"Life Animated, is a heart-warming, honest and thoughtful film about how a family made magic out of adversity."
Thinking back on &quot;Suspiria&quot; yields sense memories&#44; electronic haunted-house sounds&#44; stylish and outr&#233; brutality&#46; It&apos;s possible to forget Harper is even in it&#44; but it&apos;s not possible to forget the opening salvo of operatic violence&#46;
Here you get a rare glimpse of exactly what the interface between a West Bank resident and the Israeli army has been like ...
"The audiotapes are the treasures: They resurrect Wilson as a warm, amicable presence. It's almost if Wilson had -- dare we say it? -- invited us pull up a stool to join him for conversation and a (non-alcoholic) drink at a friendly bar."
"The Mojo Manifesto: The Life and Times of Mojo Nixon is a riot, especially for fans, or a good primer for those who don’t know him."

Chris Columbus' only good movie.
"Shawshank aside, this is the best non-horror Stephen King adaptation of the bunch."
It has to be admitted that Scott and his team have retained their ability to make the flesh crawl.
"Very much a character-driven piece, which not only makes the laughs bigger but also earns a deeper involvement."
"Sparse, uncompromising and bewitching. Reichardt has stripped back all but the bare essentials, scattering the characters across the sun-bleached landscape like marbles."
"Kapadia refuses to glamorize Winehouse's addiction as a casualty of rock 'n' roll or just another entry into the ""27 Club."""
"The most ambitious and impressive Coen film in at least a decade, featuring the flat, sun-blasted landscapes of west Texas and an eerily memorable performance by Javier Bardem."
"There's something amiably Quixotic about this recklessly dangerous flight, something innocent, and the vistas of the 19th-century London landscape are really quite something."
"The movie feels uncompromised, genuinely transgressive at times, and smart in the ways it entertains."
Fresh transitions from simmering romance to boiling carnage and in doing so becomes a deliciously moreish movie morsel.
"It's possible to be genuinely moved by that reckoning - and to admire the obvious intelligence and care that have been brought to bear on ""Stillwater"" - without fully buying the trail of contrivances and compromises it leaves in its wake."
"Structurally and tonally, the third act is a challenge. But the longer I linger on it, the more I admire the risk taken by McCarthy."
"There's a heightened edge to I, Daniel Blake, an embittered streak of comedy that keeps the otherwise miserable plot from weighing too heavily."
Even the most televisionally overstimulated will likely enjoy this boy-and-his-dog movie -- which also happens to be a girl-and-her-cat movie too.
"When the visit ends, one is grateful simply to have been in their esteemed company."
"More than a decade after The Blair Witch project turned the mock-doc format into a horror cliche, this low-tech horror show uses it to chilling effect in this story of cynicism vs. things that go bump in the night."
"Opening in domestic contentment, moving through personal anguish and ending with a cosmic lament, it's a simple, wrenching story of love and loss that pries open a window onto eternity."
"It's a fascinating news story, but the film's additional, if entertaining speculations remain just that."

"Mills tells his story with a glancing quirkiness, both affectionate and meandering."
Ruzowitzky depicts the care and attention to detail that went into the operation.

A hobo hops off a freight train in a nameless North American Gomorrah run by a sadistic crime king. Then said hobo cleans up the place by shooting buckets full of guts.
"Has the slow-pulsing vertigo of a psychological thriller & the twists of an elaborate melodrama, but to reduce it to these labels is glib. Caustic & funny but never misanthropic. A study of the ways people actually live, rather than how we assume they do."
Law's committed performance is the biggest selling point for the inconsistent movie.
The imagery on display is amazing&#44; and its power frequently overtakes the screenplay&#46;
"Beauty and the Beast is a lavish spectacle. The major drawback is the total lack of surprise. The film is well made, but plays out exactly as expected."
A hugely successful experiment to see if a movie can captivate an audience with a conversation between two people in real time.
This exploration of tumultuous romance is rare in its scope and frankness.
The genuine charm of the cast will continue to disarm those who can't entirely erase thoughts of guillotines and tumbrils.
"It may not become the Christmas classic Disney is hoping for, but it remains as pretty as a decked-out tree."
Craggy. But worth it for the views.
"Wow, TWO good movies based on Stephen King stories in the same year? You bet. As entertaining as 1408? Not quite."
The final moments of Bad Hair are as fiercely emotive as Truffaut's fabled still-shot ending for 400 Blows. This is grand cinema.
If you don't see yourself in its depiction of intense emotion I both envy and pity you.
Scorsese leaves us pondering: How far can organized religion sustain us in the face of oppression? When does pure faith kick in? And does that belief suffice?
Fever Pitch is respectful and heartfelt about the problems that come with extreme fandom and how they might impinge on the happiness of a person who couldn't care less about Carl Yastrzemski.
"Not bad adventure, nothing special, but not bad"
"Just as the plot threatens to run out of gas, Lin rescues the film with a spate of vastly ridiculous and therefore enjoyable set-pieces, most of which involve means of conveyance designed to make the cars look puny."
The Broken Circle Breakdown is a very American romance. It is also a very European tragedy.
It is the thematically-rich storytelling that makes &apos;Halloween Ends&apos; truly special&#46; Making a film  that is supposed to end an iconic horror-thriller franchise character-driven&#63; It doesn&apos;t get ballsier than that&#46;
This lively animated adventure keeps us entertained even if the story and characters aren't particularly well-developed

A surprisingly real male relationship examination.
An exciting&#44; educational and entertaining film&#44; set to instil wonder in audiences of just about any age&#46;
"2007's cool psychological suspense piece Yella, with Hoss as a woman who can't quite escape her troubled past, was one of the first films that made the international reputations of both its star and her frequent director Christoph Petzold."
"This pared-down film version mostly captures the stormy symphonic interplay of nasty recriminations, mocking taunts and hurtful revelations hurled with corrosive aplomb by a top-notch ensemble of actors."
"A beautifully mounted, fiercely intelligent, bracingly alive literary adaptation that remains an unabashed crowd-pleaser."
"There's plenty to laugh at in Stern and Sundberg's picture, both in the footage of Rivers on stage and in front of the filmmakers' camera."
Lonsdale carries this love story&#44; even if it spends a little too much time focused on its outlandish premise &amp; not enough time on the actual romance&#46;
"Hustlers is brash, often crude and unabashedly chaotic, but it is its ""buddy movie"" sensibility which ultimately wins the day. A robustly made, beautifully acted and decidedly engaging story about some unlikely heroines."
An almost unimaginably thrilling experience.
"A bespectacled, bow-tie wearing beagle with a genius IQ and a penchant for terrible puns... Erudite, pedantic, prissily formal, he sounds a lot like Niles from Frasier but he'd make a great Dog-tor Who."
Writer/director Jason Orley's debut is funny ... but it's also surprisingly insightful about why these characters do the things they do and let it get so out of control...
"At the end of the day, while unnecessary, ""Army of Thieves"" thrives because Schweighöfer's go-for-broke attitude pushes this overlong, low-stakes, heist caper into the realm of enjoyability."
"Although Hall's impressive debut is about very specific people in a particular place and time, the questions it raises and the experiences it dramatizes are broader, more universal."
An absolutely heartbreaking tearjerker...
"...a brilliant, precise cast. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Overall, Arctic Tale's one true message is clear: Stop global warming before it's too late."
The exploration is deep&#44; very deep&#44; so much so that one could easily imagine a much darker and edgier film could have been the result&#46; As it is&#44; &quot;Seriously Red&quot; sneaks up on you&#46;
"Those who were furious at Tyson will be made even angrier by Toback's film, for here is a fresh provocation-an attempt to restore to Tyson the human dimensions that have been taken from him (by himself, of course, as well as by others)."
"An existing affection for Waititi's specific brand of humour will help audiences embrace this film, but the bold optimism of his worldview comes through in any context."
"A fascinating look at the intersection of commerce, celebrity, and controversy."
[A] joyfully oddball work about friends who aren't your friends and the price one young couple must pay for always being happy.
"When Stone finally achieves a comfortable balance between the pretty young things and the cornucopia of crazies, the film truly comes to full life as the lurid, down and dirty entertainer one hopes for."
"Even though it's not exactly easy to watch the protracted deaths of two children, this is not only one of the greatest anime ever, but also an important (anti-) war film. A moving masterpiece."
"Here, Jeunet’s bright colors and prankish manipulation of space makes a suburban home and its lookalike environs an appropriate carnival atmosphere. Big Bug turns a spiritual and political pandemic into a three-dimensional funhouse mirror."
The story sets out to be that whimsical escapist romance with a European setting where love and heartbreak span decades in that mystery format. Director Augustine Frizzell pulls out all the stops at making this film the unabashed epic romance that it is.
"The feel-good story and sing-along production numbers are likely to please the movie's target audience of tween girls, but there's not a whole lot in ""Annie"" to win their parents over."
"Egerton is so gosh-darn sweet as the skier, and Hugh Jackman makes such a swell jerk as his trainer, Bronson Peary, that you'll take the ride with them anywhere"
"Enough cannot be said about the sharpness and intelligence of Ade's script, and how credibly it sketches the connections between its superficially disparate co-protagonists."

...a surprisingly touching drama about finding that balance between our past and present selves.
A medley of familiar Christmas classics...with a distinct Muppet spin.

&#8220;Goodnight Mommy&#8221; is a roll of the dice&#46; If the premise intrigues you&#44; you&#8217;re taking your chances&#46; Nicely shot and paced&#44; it will hold your interest&#44; but it is the ending that will determine whether you consider it time well spent&#46;

"The Perfect Man isn't perfect, but it's not bad company for 100 minutes."
"The real humor comes, once again from Murphy, whose Donkey is so genuinely funny and clever that he very nearly steals the film. Except that it's stolen by Banderas as a rogue Puss In Boots outlaw hired by the King to do in Shrek."
Steven Spielberg's best movie in at least a decade.
Explores with creative and comic energy the difficulties of the sibling bond and the mixed feelings we often have for those who share our history.
"Walt Disney has no peer in the field of animated features and his latest, based on the familiar King Arthur legend, is brimming with mirth, music and magic."

An essential documentary that helps explain today's politics (and perhaps tomorrow's) around the world. [Full Review in Spanish]
"This imbalance in the screenplay keeps Far From Men from its chance at greatness. Nevertheless, its strong stance of taking the side of humanity, even in the face of a civil war in which sides are expected to be taken, deserves respect and applause."
This is the kind of intimate little indie that I wish we got more of.

"Like 'The Lord of the Rings,' 'Spider-Man' is grandly, emotionally affecting in a way that it had started to seem that Hollywood blockbusters never would be again."
"Demonstrates how homage can provide the undercurrent for a films visual and narrative language, yet go beyond simplistic checkboxing of references...Plays like a cold winter storm with occasional gusts punctuating the biting, incessant frigidity."
"Quincy is lovingly put together and recounts one of the most distinguished and interesting careers in American entertainment. However, it's almost too much to fit into a single movie."
"This sequel to the Kingsman: The Secret Service (based on the comicbook series) veers in several directions, but the last half hour when things come together, more than makes up for the wait."
"Like Jean-Paul Sartre's No Exit-tentialism, but more crowded and with the musk of bottled-up testosterone."

a complex plot that manages to balance character writing with slam-bang action sequences

Impressive scary indie horror pic.
A minor anthology delight from Max Ophüls
"German made horror/slasher pic that rocks, as it makes the viewer uncomfortable."
"While disguised as a tale of revenge, the heart of THE REVENANT is a tale of survival. It's an ode to the visceral beauty of nature and the relentless, savage force that is life."

"We're invited to contemplate the torments of mental instability and the awful intimacies of family life, as well as whatever malignant forces may lurk behind the veil of everyday existence."

"What remains is a fascinating, Kafkaesque portrayal of justice (or lack thereof) in modern China, but it's no knee-slapper and, at more than two hours, it's long for a comedy."
An eerie and intimate psychological thriller with Hitchcockian tones harkening back to the Shyamalan's early 2000s run that put him on the filmmaking map.
"A round of hide and seek with some blue bloods gets, well, bloody in the very funny horror-satire Ready or Not."
"To a tale which is, happily, naughty but nice about love and marriage and set with wistful witty tunes and recitatives, Vincente Minnelli adds his own special touch of sophistication and burlesque at the expense of the period's fashions and manners."
"Funny, sad and bittersweet - one of Noah Baumbach's finest."
Writer/director Thomas Robert Lee's The Curse of Audrey Earnshaw ... doesn't do much new but does present its story with a strong command of mood.
"A tale of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy."
It&#8217;s been years &#8212; maybe as far back as &#8220;All the President&#8217;s Men&#8221; in 1976 &#8212; that a movie has captured the craft and the passion of journalism as precisely and as smartly as director Maria Schrader&#8217;s &#8220;She Said&#46;&#8221;
"Love and Honor is a welcome affirmation of Yamada's determination to maintain his historic workload, even while in his 70s."
"A magnetic, brilliant and captivating film where the director knows how to tense the threads that unite the imagination of the spectator with the imagery of distant worlds. [Full review in Spanish]"

"I could not possibly care less about football, and I fell hopelessly in love with this movie, and with the can-do amateur team it introduces us to."
"While it lacks outright Cronenbergian pleasures, ""Maps to the Stars"" repeatedly connects as a dark comedy and insidious display of rancid human behavior."
Strangely inert and lifeless.
Johnstone&#8217;s film revels in the humor of its premise complete with pop songs and children&#8217;s toys gone awry&#46;
A striking phantasm of affection&#44; regrets&#44; and remembered accounts that might be factually inaccurate but emotionally unfeigned&#46;
"Disney's multi-Oscar nominated musical is not as good as Mary Poppins to which it's often compared, but Angela Lansbury is well-cast and most of the visual effects, which won the Oscar, are impressive."
"Green concocts a series of deliciously telling moments of behavior or lines of dialogue, and a game cast and crew are equal to the offbeat content."
"Eastwood takes the film in some interesting directions by sticking to documented facts, zeroing in on Richard's reluctant decision to fight back against the system he loves..."
"Each time the script wobbled into cliché, I cringed. The actresses are too talented to flail on hallucinogens. But they launch into idiocy with so much energy that even the dumbest scenes lift-off."
"The outrage of actor-turned- writer-director Peter Mullan is palpable, and every frame of this shocking and occasionally exploitative film is designed to ensure that this reaction is contagious."
"Williams delivers a solid, twinkle-free (though closed-off) performance, but the film as a whole can't decide what it wants to be."
A passable yet underwhelming sequel...
"It will make you feel wonderful, and if you're like me, whose emotional barometer responds in the positive with tears, take plenty of tissues."

Deliciously macabre... Nightcrawler is popcorn snuff.
A complex film about the minefield of loyalty and betrayal.

The first 'must see' movie of the year.
Princess of Tides

A tremendous film&#46; Something that looks at a hard topic like depression in a very beautiful and human way&#46; 
"Scandi-noir takes a supernatural turn in Joachim Trier's creepy, erotic thriller."
"Is it possible to recommend a movie based on a single scene alone? If it's The Forbidden Kingdom, the answer is an obvious ""Yes."""
"Production designer Anna Falgures and cinematographer Jeanne Lapoirie expertly capture the town-and-country contrasts, while De France and Higelin boldly commit to their challenging, if underwritten roles."
Palm Springs builds on the concept's legacy by using it to examine negotiations between two people instead of a path for self-betterment.

"We finally have a popular biopic that young LGBTQ people can sample, and embrace or reject based on their own views and needs."
"Despite the chaos of the mixed genres and the strange narrative, The Five Devils still has standout moments. Dramé is exquisite as the precocious Vicky."
A perplexing but all-too-human psychological drama ...
"An absorbing, rewatchable drama that quietly told loud truths, and wore its anger remarkably lightly."
"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari illustrates something more eternal: about great manipulators, and the underlying anxiety that either society has gone mad, or we have."
"Jennifer Lopez is outstanding as Selena, lending ability and grace to the stage numbers, in particular, but throughout the film, in general."
[Hugh] Grant is a hoot throughout as he channels vintage Michael Caine for equal parts menace and camp.
"""The Beguiled"" probably could've benefited from a little more energy in its telling. Still, Coppola offers some gorgeous images of the past made present."
... an enjoyably frothy 'date movie'...
Khaou carefully constructs each scene for maximum impact-intentional repetition expressing the experience's ever-changing evolution.

It could have been called What a Girl Actually Has.
As a snapshot of an age and life stage&#44; Trier helms a film that&apos;s canny and incisive&#44; also perfects the sensation of constantly zipping onwards even when it seems as if you&apos;re stuck&#44; and knows how to find both joy and darkness in tandem&#46;
"Sang-ho can't quite resist a last-minute lurch towards sentimentality, but for the most part he keeps this moveable feast for the undead on track with relentless and bloody carnage."
"With the extraordinary Hoffman doing double duty as director, this film -- with its incisive look at the fragile women and benumbed men of NYC's lost army of loners -- is one of the best of 2010."
"The Rock and Emily Blunt knock themselves out to entertain in this dopey, derivative, theme-park ride of a movie. But, hey, the kids will love it and like the Metallica thrasher that bizarrely shows up on the soundtrack, ""nothing else matters."""
A meditative Western that focuses on the spiritual transformation of a female settler into a leader as she journeys West in a covered wagon caravan.
"This, Albert's voice, is what separates this piece from reports from other publications - those minute details spoken with such a nostalgic, heartfelt cadence, being revisited in the present, never spoken on screen beforehand."
"Gringo gets a lot of mileage out of its energy, its ability to use cruelty as a motivational tool rather than just as a way of belittling others, and its copious amounts of creative violence."
"Thriller about brothers has realistic violence, language."
"""The Signal"" is a sci-work of thoughtful hints and feints, but the movie's big reveal raises as many questions as it answers."
"What Days offers is an incredibly realistic, near-documentarian sketch of two ordinary lives that informs you of the characters' circumstances and emotional state without telling you anything."
"We are definitely on familiar, well-travelled ground, which explains why the visually impressive Reminiscence is good but falls well short of great."
"At the movie's climax, they [the actors] bring new life to liberte, egalite and, of course, fraternite."
"A sweet, quickly told story and very good writing makes it very easy to love I Love You, Man. Another plus: it's not produced, written or directed by Judd Apatow."
"It's best to approach Find Me Guilty as a showcase for Diesel, who is finally beginning to prove he's more than the next-generation Van Damme."
Count 'Camp' as the rarity it is: a modern movie that's funny and sweet.
"...the career of consumer advocate Ralph Nader, in an adoring hagiography..."

"Tangerine unostentatiously celebrates fluidity, community, support and is generally quite hearteningly right-on..."
"It's a combination of nostalgia, good vibes and even a bit of ""you can't reheat a soufflé,"" but if you loved the first one you'll connect to this sequel. Wesley Snipes is rad!"
"Sure, the closer you get the more it has a cubic-zirconia feel, costume jewelry instead of the real thing, but, hey, it's a plenty breezy diversion here in the latter days of this seemingly unending winter."
Anderson skillfully dissects the idea of the New York intellectual bourgeoisie and examines the growing void between families.
"Clearly, del Toro has a deep affection for both his characters and the world of gods and fairy-tale monsters, and it translates into a rich, sophisticated sequel that actually improves on the original."

Spike Lee using his white voice - for subversive purposes.
Features a great performance from the Danish actor Jesper Christensen.
Need escape? Logan Lucky is for you.

A truly F'ed up thriller and aesthetic experience.
"This film bites with all of its teeth. It's an exercise in a certain level of brutality that we seem to reserve for those we know the best -- our family, our friends, our neighbors."
It's wicked and cynical and I suspect Hollywood will want to remake it but will strip out its acidic nature.
"Exquisite on every level, Dreamchild is a film to cherish."

"Among the more unique, one-of-a-kind movies of the year. And I'd love to see a where-are-they-now sequel in a few years."
Godzilla Vs Kong delivers action and spectacle by the bucket load and will leave anyone who wants to see a giant ape hit a giant lizard in the face with an axe very satisfied&#46;
"The movie's ending will not satisfy everyone, but it does avoid typical Hollywood conventions. Whether it is the correct finale is something you will have to search your own heart to answer."

"There are worse ways to spend two hours than in the company of ""Snow White and the Huntsman."""
"As a record of the Al Franken you already know and love, Hegedus and Doob's rather slapdash movie is fun."

"[Alexander] Payne is aided greatly by [George] Clooney, whose befuddled expressions should be engraved in the cement at Grauman's Chinese."

The tone of the movie is cheerily macabre.
"A cross-generational character comedy whose biggest problem is its characters, Noah Baumbach's While We're Young is sharply observed but frustratingly slight."
1960s-set family drama tackles weighty issues.
Oakley has crafted a sad and shrewd film about the loneliness of hiding your true self and the inherent evils of compulsory heterosexuality&#44; especially under the guise of &#8220;protecting children&#46;&#8221;

"A lickety-split, madly packed, roller-coaster entertainment that might almost have been designed to make you scared of how much smarter your kids are than you."
An intriguing tale that twists and turns in some unexpected ways.
"Director, Scott Hicks has created a really lovely film. It's fortunate that the star power of Clive Owen gives the film a core dynamism."
"... The film’s writer-director, Colm Bairéad, shows how a well-judged movie can come near to corniness but still be deeply poignant. "
"For casual race fans, Racing Dreams is a real eye-opener. And it's a darned entertaining way to get a handle on a sport that can seem like a bunch of cars doing circles for a crowd that seems most interested in seeing that next epic wreck."
"It's essentially a soundtrack -- and a good one at that, led by Timberlake and Anna Kendrick, with contributions from Gwen Stefani -- in search of a story."
"Though not without striking qualities by itself, it serves best as a poignant stepping stone to the auteur's later, more famous projects."
"A twisty, chilly vision of haute-yuppie parenting as unrelenting nightmare, an ingenious reworking of the demon-seed genre in which the evil child is not the real villain."
"A goofball riff on the pirate-movie genre, this sequel is as insubstantial as popcorn -- and as delicious."
"Cloying smart, gleefully mischievous and resplendently, stupendously gross."
"Not Okay is like many “internet movies” before it – approaching uncanny valley, somewhat obvious, just a little off — but this unsettling darkness makes it a solid entry into the canon of just-okay social media films."
I'll Sleep When I'm Dead may take its place with Get Carter as a classic British gangster film.
It's a very sly piece of filmmaking.
"This is the arid equivalent of Werner Herzog's Aguirre, Wrath of God. Reichardt offers the minimum of genre conventions and none of the genre's satisfactions or resolutions."
"Any frustration is neutralized whenever Krieps is onscreen. The actress plays Chris as beguilingly childlike, her feelings and impulses... right at the surface, intensifying and subsiding, arpeggio-like."

The film can jar when oscillating between the CG-realised worlds and sequences with actors playing non-Na&#8217;vi characters&#44; but for the most part The Way of Water is a sumptuous visual tapestry&#46;

"Transcendent and absorbing, depicting our place in the universe with ferocious honesty and unflinching strength."
"The Sacrament is worth a watch for fans of the director and cast, but its lack of purpose or anything to say limits its staying power dramatically."
"Wong made Chungking in just 23 days, and the film's mad-dash energy is nicely reflected in his quartet of stars. Wong, himself a star of cinema's future, has already shown that he possesses a uniquely '90s voice, eye and spirit."

Deep Impact hits the bull's eye for sci-fi action thrills and the sheer power of an engrossing adventure that marries plausible ideas with a jump into the beyond.
"Though it may seem Biller is mountain an assault on delightfully garish exploitation fare - with overemphatic titles like ""Vixen!"", ""Score!"" and ""The Lickerish Quartet"" - that's not quite what she's doing."
"Suffers the same problems that most sitcom to movie adaptations suffer from, but fans of the series should find lots to love."
"The satire's still there, albeit not as angry and more obvious, and the targets have shifted. It may not have the original's subversive nutso attitude but there's a couple of crazy surprises up its sleeve and a surprisingly engaging story."
A feat of photography.
"Corseted courtesies and the candlelit rooms with their flickering pools of light never overwhelm the story's contemporary resonance. The clash of male assumption and jealousy, and female wiles and independence, has no shortage of present-day parallels."
"A thoroughly enjoyable film with a lot to like about it, even if you're not a fan of 'The Boss.'"
"Be it Panda-Rific, Perfectly Panda or Panda-monium, one thing is for certain when we're talking about Kung Fu Panda 3 - It's the Best.Panda.Ever."
"Efficient, well-crafted and solid to a fault, The Finest Hours might have been made 30 or 70 years ago, and starred Gary Cooper or James Stewart -- it's profoundly old-fashioned but pretty enjoyable for all that."
"This is meaty, dramatic stuff - see this movie with your teenagers and watch their jaws hit the floor -- and the filmmakers cannily use President Nixon's secret tapes to bolster their case..."

"It's a fascinating puzzle: a film that is simultaneously an indictment of the toxic legacy of cultural imperialism and a weepie that employs the familiar tropes of Hollywood, one of the biggest machines of cultural imperialism on the planet."
What's funny about exploitation? You'd be amazed.
"One of the two very smart things that the film does is to keep the original 1975 setting, as the story would have been altered far too much to be set in the digital age."
"Clooney is remarkable in Alexander Payne's film about loss, confusion and getting by."
"Republican, Democrat, or Independent, the only side THE REPORT chooses is the fight for human rights."

"Hoffman and Cruise give signature performances in this thoughtful, and hugely enjoyable, classic."
"Labaki's realistic camera following Zain, whose family is undocumented migrants, takes viewers into the heart of a very real, universal issue, no, not about refugees, but the problem of unfit parenting."
"Ostensibly a comedy about inspiration and creativity, The Muse is a clunker that's actually painfully lacking in both qualities."
"[Abdel] Kechiche knows his subject and the film reflects the warmth and understanding with which he views it, though it is inordinately long at 2 hrs and 30 minutes."
"Shows that it's not only possible to make a spine-tingling World War II saga without bloodshed, but also to use such stories to examine the agonizing-but-necessary values of conscience, loyalty and forgiveness."
"An attractive, energetic young cast and some witty, off-center visual humor make the resultant laughs more than worth the wait."
"With so many ideas in play, the film is never dull. Sometimes it's also funny, perceptive and nuanced. Things get deeper and dirtier as it rolls on, but not really clearer, in terms of purpose."
"Mary Poppins Returns is solid, reliable family fare and only the hardest heart will leave the cinema bereft of a smile. It might not be another classic, but it's brolly good fun."
"It's a film that is very much in the tradition of British social realism. Nonetheless, it remains light and joyful enough to be enjoyed and recognised by an audience with the same demographic and age as the characters on screen."
"While watching ""Gold,"" I felt I had seen the story before. And, I realize that I had, many times and ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" comes to mind - without Bogey and bandits that ""don't need no stinking badges."""
"For me, Ferrara and Keitel will always be the bad lieutenant, but Werner Herzog is probably the only director qualified to take this on, and his bizarre reboot has a fascination all of its own."
"What it all amounts to is a tremendously funny feel good film that doesn't quite stand on its own so much as it plays as a great (the BEST, really) companion-piece to The Room that a cult film fan could ask for."
The film set a strong tone for modern summer blockbuster films in 1993 and continues to be one of the most iconic movies ever to hit a silver screen in the summer months.
a cheerfully silly caper comedy that mixes in a little of 'My Fair Lady' and a lot of 'The Honeymooners' as it breezes along. ...Allen and Tracey Ullman spar and slander each other with an almost maniacal glee.
"Nicely composed and played with an endearing sense of Hitchcockian humour, Grand Piano is well worth a tinkle."
Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium should delight audiences in the mood for holiday magic.

"The plot is ludicrous but one doesn't go to Luc Besson action films for character-driven storytelling; they go for exactly what this film promises and delivers -- frenetic, inspired, grin-inducing action."
"What struck me in now is that it eschews the plot, and going off into flights of comic fancy including re-doing the ending a couple times until theyre satisfied. The result is still funny, still EXCELLENT and SCHWING! Two on-air reviews in one link! "
"If these movie cops were your local police, you'd want them strung up on charges and locked away. In a fictionalized past, sure, it's still amoral, but that would only be a problem if the movie ever took itself seriously."
"A streamlined, ""Reader's Digest"" version of real-life events. However, it is a gorgeous, worthwhile re-telling thanks to a fine cast; top-notch art direction; a beautiful, mostly piano score by Stephen Warbeck; and Gabriel Beristain's ravishing cinematog"
"It's entirely ridiculous, but it gallops cheerfully along; everything is carried off with flair and ingenuity."
"There's enough juice to sustain a fan's interest for awhile. It ain't much, but watching Scully and Mulder inch closer romantically, and seeing some cool special effects is worth the price of admission."
"As comfort-blanket romcoms go, it is the rare one that will not bring you out in a rash."
"A languorous, visually striking movie about love and loss, infused with the earnestness of young people struggling with powerful emotions and with evolving ideas about life, death, art, freedom and responsibility."
The flashy style cannot hide the slight story.
Foreign-film comfort food...at its best in exploring the psychology of the adopted.
"Without a musical soundtrack and through elongated fixed planes full of internal rhythm, the film is the perfect weapon against the apostles of moral superiority. [Full review in Spanish]"

&#91;Newell and Attanasio&#93; pay as much attention to emotional details as to the clockwork details of mob life&#46;

"As a horror movie, ""Brightburn"" gets the job done but in strange ways."
"There is nothing left for the critic at this point but to corroborate all that has been said of it, to add his own warmest words of acclaim"

"Its mock-artistic thriller trappings notwithstanding, 'In Bruges' is basically a funny, tragicomic two-hander, with the casting of Farrell alongside Gleeson enabling a pleasing Irish inflection."
"A competent genre movie enlivened by vivid sense of place/culture - shot on location in New Orleans, delving into the world of merchant seaman/dock workers/smugglers."
"Treating his seafood substantially better than Oldboy, Jiro is a miracle of perfectionism married to expertise. The same can said for Gelb's loving documentary."
Franciosi grabs the film by its shoulders and turns it into a searing&#44; singular experience&#46;
A slick weepie made by smart guys who want you to know they're better than the schlockmeisters.
A totally absorbing movie.
A non-stop action fest.
Good but not great. Streep and Roberts feel a little too much like stunt-casting.
"Broader and more accessible than either Shaun Of The Dead or Hot Fuzz, Paul is pure Pegg and Frost - clever, cheeky and very, very funny."
Skyfall returns Bond to Solid Ground
"Pitt's ridiculous, wildly over-the-top performance somehow keeps it all together."
"Thanks to her infectious laugh and caustic sense of humour, as well as her honesty about what she's witnessed, we are treated to a welcome portrait of an artist who continues to radiate us with her talent."
"Despite the director's smarmy narration and interviews, the bemused equanimity of these folks who've seen it all could inspire each of us to what ""we can can"" do as we age."
Director Igal Hecht has pulled together a compelling film about an extraordinary man. There are moments of true heartbreak and tragedy mixed with wild road stories and the Iron Sheik's trademark over-the-top personality.
It's both gorgeous enough and emotionally engaging enough to be worth seeking out.
"There are lots of lovely touches, including animated sequences (the film is based on a graphic novel) and Powley is terrific - funny and wise beyond her years."
"Extraordinary...not only an engrossing first-hand account of Israel's Palestinian policies over time, but one that may have lessons to teach both Israeli leaders and other nations confronting those they identify as terrorists."
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a mind-blowing visual and mental extravaganza that leaves you in utter awe...
"It might not supplant ""It's a Wonderful Life"" in the pantheon of required December viewing, but I recommend giving it a spot in your holiday rotation."
"The perfect conversation starter, and a great way for people unable (or unwilling) to understand the trans struggle to see it from a fresh, new perspective."
"It's a surprisingly epic and spirited film, driven by an adventurous spirit and enough clever fun to keep things fresh during a sometimes long-winded ride."
"Anderson eloquently blends these characters together for a tantalizing seriocomic medley. He keeps his proceedings glossy and tantalizing, while steady and harshly real."
"""The animation was beautiful, the storyline set in place, telling a tale of how traditions and cultures can work presently to unite us all."""
"The film is one of those rare beasts, with a sense of genuine permanency. It beds down in your mind, like it is preparing to live there for a while. It is not pretty, but it is, sometimes, very beautiful."
One of 2022&apos;s 20 best films&#46;
"At 89, Morenos petite frame still radiates star charisma and vitality. Viewers will come away from this film feeling like Moreno didnt just live life; she earned it."

"Love it or hate it, you won't be able to leave it alone."

Even Cecil B. DeMille might have been impressed.
"If you want a film that is big and true and tough, go see Synecdoche. And then go see it again, because it's so rich with ideas that you can't possibly get them all the first time around."
Amalric&#8217;s emotional mystery&#44; as its fragments and enigmas unfold&#44; isn&#8217;t necessarily a journey for viewers to solve but rather a state of mind to understand&#58; the bewitchingly poignant story of a woman&#8217;s fertile&#44; possibly perilous&#44; coping mechanism&#46;
"Stunning visuals and imagery, exceptional directing, and stellar performances by all the cast members make this the can't miss movie of the year."
"Entertaining and well acted, but redundant and a bit machinelike."
[A] satirical tableau of a Poland that does not recognize itself. [Full review in Spanish]
"Taking the long view that Winner's case is hardly an aberration, the director seems to inhabit the role of whistleblower as well, upending an ongoing narrative put forth by those outside the government that continues to see that true justice isn't served."
The Wayans are the masters of spoof.
intelligent and moving
"A loving paean to Bond, Flint, Helm and their ilk (as well as a myriad of outlandish villains), the film knows its turf and only missteps when it ventures into more contemporary territory."
"Whether it's ""Alex Rider,"" ""Agent Cody Banks"" or ""Spy Kids,"" plenty have tried to adapt the 007 shtick to younger characters, with demonstrably dopey results. In the end, the reason it works for Vaughn is that he's making the film for adults."
"The filmmakers have created an intensely stark and visceral representation of this hellish place, and the cinematography is intimate and stunning."
Decent 70s thriller.
"Girl Asleep might be about an awakening, but it's not a sexual awakening, and this is one teen comedy in which, at long last, the geek doesn't get the girl."
"Boasting a clever title, this is an inspired piece of lunacy about sociology versus biology, with terrific performances from Ben Stiller and his two sets of parents."
"Splice went down smooth, with its sleek surfaces, terrific special effects and disturbing sexiness."
"The Christian-themed drama God Bless the Broken Road wears its earnest heart on its sleeve, and isn't afraid to show it."
"What's special about the film is how much we come to know Frankie, perhaps more than he knows himself."
"After a muddled beginning, the deliberately paced film ties together its characters and disparate genre elements in mostly unexpected ways."
Engaging without relying on blockbuster bravado.
"Mostly, you'll just have to take my word for it that Spider-Man: Far From Home is a damned delight."
"Don't get me wrong, Spider-Man is no instant classic, but as summer blockbuster entertainment, you're not apt to find much better"
"THE PIANIST is Polanski's most personal work to date, and perhaps because of that, Polanski seems to have rediscovered the cinematic voice he had as a young man."
A pleasure. [Full review in Spanish]
"At least Ratner knows how to handle both action and drama on screen, even if subtlety and substance fall by the wayside."
Judging it by itself as a solo slasher film from 2018 it aced it... as a sequel it did even better.
Pfeiffer is outstanding.
"The directors jump into an impoverished, fast-moving life, and never attempt to put on the brakes for the sake of providing audience comfort."
Micmacs is eccentric ecstasy.   [Full review in Spanish]

"William Wayne, who wrote, directed, produced, edited, and stars in the film...clearly had a vision for the movie."
"Menashe may be a film of understated storytelling and plot, but its pleasures lie primarily in the wonderfully observational approach that Weinstein takes to his protagonist."
"Director Lee Chang-dong has complete mastery of the tone here and he gets great, subtle performances from his cast."
"Director Ryusuke Hamaguchi uses his ample running time to help us understand his complex, guarded characters so we cannot help but feel happy when they find some measure of happiness"
It's Swamp Thing. It's not Swamp Hamlet or MacBeth Thing.
"Cage delivers a superb performance in a role that seems specifically tailored to his abilities, helping Sarnoski find a brutal reality underneath what initially appears to be a silly concept for a revenge picture."
"[Fellin] turns the world into his circus and, in a liberated, quasi-documentary style, resurrects some of history's great pagliacci with their cornucopia of practical jokes, smashed hats, pulled chairs, popping balloons and squirting flowers."
Silly but irresistible.
"While The Long Night may not be revolutionary, it's definitely got its own dark magic."
"On the run in New York with every hitman in creation on his tail, JW needs the skills of a samurai, the reflexes of a striking snake, the speed and stealth of a wolf, a hide of pig iron and a perfectly tailored suit."
"It is a sitcom with teeth and haunting moral echoes, no small amount of vulgarity and a smart streak of comedy."
"It sounds like the latest release from Blumhouse Productions, but the documentary from filmmakers Shannon Service and Jeffrey Waldron is more frightening than any fabricated specter as the underbelly of Thailand's seafood trade is exposed."
"Imagine a Spike Jonze-Charlie Kauffman-Michel Gondry-style film but with a warm, beating heart instead of cool, detached hipster irony."
"The result is a decent picture, if one that leans pretty heavily on the future resonance of every interaction and conversation."
Springy and funny. A literary adaptation for people who don't like literary adaptations.
"Sorkin owes more to the slam-bang mayhem of Danny Boyle than the visual elegance of David Fincher, but mostly he gets out of the way of his writing - delivering for good and ill (but mostly good) a full-throttle Sorkin ride."
"In spots, the movie can be hysterical. But, for the most part, its appeal is not unlike that of a veteran rock band putting on a greatest hits concert."
"Anchored by Denzel Washington's steely presence, it's a spare, brutal vigilante exercise, with an element of righteous revenge mixed into the balance."
There's something quite wonderful about having a bear that is this free to speak its mind.
"In an age when the Shrek films make oral sex jokes and Cars 2 flip-flops between tedium and terror, the real pleasure of the gentle, graceful Winnie the Pooh is that it is a kid's film that really, truly works for kids."
The performances by Michael Douglas and Matt Damon are wonderful. The fug of jealousy and drug-fuelled paranoia is very well maintained.
A young African Christian travels to Israel in an insightful drama about the moral conflict between religious idealism and the crude materialism of the modern world.
"It's on for the relatively young and old in the sixth M.I. go-round, with Tom Cruise back on deck, Henry Cavill joining the ranks as an agenda-heavy CIA agent and Christopher McQuarrie taking the reins once more."
It's such a superlative movie that it seems better the second time you see it.
"Few films in recent history have moved me quite like Supernova, a sensitive drama starring Stanley Tucci as one half of a gay couple who is slowly but surely succumbing to dementia."
Orphan&#58; First Kill is every bit as satisfyingly twisted as its predecessor&#44; and certainly counts as the most gloriously demented horror surprise since Malignant&#46;
"""Christine"" is based on true events, and I suspect it's all the more powerful if you don't know what happens at the end. I did, but the film still gripped me."
"This latest adaptation of a rarely well-filmed novel makes a strong effort to capture the stiflingly provincial world that Flaubert was able to describe in such precise, painstaking detail on the page."
"Marlon Brando gives a bravura, dusty-voice performance in the title role as the Sicilian who harvests favours from all comers, only to ask them to be paid back."
"Fun, forgettable stuff -- but also a (slightly) better film than the reviews would have you believe."
"Mansfield 66/67 tries to pin down a mythic figure, caught in changing times, changing attitudes towards women, and the endless altercation between exploitation and empowerment."
Makes the Jumanji reboot superfluous.
If Merchant-Ivory made a horror film it would look something like this.
"It's not the tightest picture, but the primary elements are well cared for, providing a reasonable green-and-red rush of festive fun."

"Just when it seemed as if we had lost Tom Cruise to the ranks of paycheck-cashing automatons no longer interested in applying themselves on screen, along comes American Made to show there's still some life left in the maverick actor."
"Tonally inconsistent, at least it errs on the side of ambition and cleverness; its box-office failure suggests that male genre fans don't want to be asked to identify with the victims instead of the menace."
"Gray’s latest, Armageddon Time, is a flawed work. But it sees the filmmaker at his most vulnerable, as he twists the camera back on himself and asks: of all the paths that brought me here, how many were carved out by my own privilege? "
"""Red Rocket"" remains such a blisteringly raw and febrile character study because of how things fluctuate along the fixed orbit of its star."
"Behind the camaraderie, there's a nuanced story of disenchantment and disillusionment in humanity as the result of greed and war-induced PTSD. [Full review in Spanish]"
A fantastic action thriller with Brandon Lee center stage and showing what he's capable of as a hero and action star.
&#214;stlund gives us plenty to absorb as he runs his filthy rich subjects through the wringer&#46; Some scenes are savagely funny while others are simply savage&#46; More importantly&#44; we&#8217;re always engaged&#46;
Guest seems to know just how far he can stretch reality without losing the crucial texture of verisimilitude. This is a comedy even cat lovers might adore.
On paper it looks like a carbon copy of Highlander but Theron&#46;&#46;&#46; and a series of entertaining action set pieces that are directed with verve and style by director Gina Prince-Bythewood&#46;&#46;&#46; prove you can teach The Old Guard new tricks&#46;
"Stop me if you've heard this one, but sometimes politicians get us into wars that last forever and go nowhere under false pretenses."
An assault of expressionistic techniques...
"There's tons of delicious suspense of the horror-flick variety... and plenty of Spielbergian shock-awe... but what makes it one of the most satisfying examples of found-footage flicks yet is its observational, journalistic ethos."
"The film’s effectiveness depends on what occurs on the way to the answers, and in this respect Shyamalan’s wit and sincerity serve him and the audience well."
"On the surface it looks like any other urban drama, but Tipping's use of whimsical fairy tale and sci-fi elements combines with heartbreaking social commentary for a totally unique experience."
Nelms' screenplay slyly comments on the holiday's superficial elements by cutting away the sentimental veneer.
"A witty exploration of black American culture, past and present."
"If ""Leviathan"" showed us the primal terror of everyday life, this new film is a warm hug, a salute to our shared humanity."

"Aftersun is a bright, funny, immensely likeable and touching film."
...surprisingly poignant...
"A sad, compassionate piece of documentary filmmaking which considers the film industry's exploitation of child actors through a unique prism."
Much of the film is very funny as it explores the eccentricities and daily routines of these Londoners.
"Perhaps the film isn't a grandiose statement of splintered lives, but it's an agreeable drama, best when it stays close to the decomposing heart of a professional liar."
This is a work of profound and melancholic beauty; every bit as essential in the 21st century as it was in the 20th.
"A precursor to the far better Rear Window, but noir has seen better days."
A really well-assembled account of the people and the music they made.

"James Toback's Black and White is meant to be an incendiary movie, but it's really only just OK."
"Nonetheless, these reservations are not intended to diminish the eminent merits of The Best Years of Our Lives, in which the mastery of one of the world's greatest directors is ever on display. "
"[Idris] Elba isn't afraid to keep it real when it comes to visualising D's slow descent to darkness, transitioning from colourful Kingston to run-down, gritty London."
"Jesse and Celine seem like real people, complete with flaws and weaknesses. That they become so fleshed out in such a brief running time is a testament to the script and Hawke and Delpy's acting abilities."
"Warm and witty, but essentially an R-rated TV movie/history lesson."
Reaps its full portion of machismo's horrors and hosannas.
"For anyone who appreciates artistic integrity and is interested in genuinely independent films, the prolific and highly personal work of John Sayles is essential viewing."
Seeing is definitely worth believing in the Hong Kong supernatural thriller The Eye. Quite imaginative and cerebrally challenging for a spookfest narrative...never blinks when it comes to its inherent hair-raising high jinks.
It's not often that you find a film that's completely bonkers and wholesome all in one package. PG: PSYCHO GOREMAN has this in spades.

"Hanks does an admirable job of showing Sully's humiliating stress while his reputation was being challenged, with the first-rate support of a cast that includes Laura Linney as his wife, and Jamey Sheridan and Anna Gunn as his surly inquisitors."
One in a Thousand is yet another strong coming-of-age film about queer youth - further proof that these stories will never grow old so long as they're as personal and well-crafted as this.
"Big, showy and over the top with highs, lows, laughs and some truly fist-pumping performances from a diverse cast of familiar actors, most of them in roles requiring some serious belting and hoofing."
"A well-constructed, narratively audacious blockbuster released at a time when such things are in depressingly short supply."
Eli Timoner gave us a manual for how to live&#59; documenting her father&#8217;s life and death&#44; Ondi gives us a manual for how to say goodbye&#46;
"For the most part, ""Pieces of a Woman"" is a model of concentration and clout, fired up by actors of unstinting ardor."
"Beautifully and unobtrusively shot by Moritz Schultheiß, My Skinny Sister is a tender portrait of teenage angst and a salutary warning against the dangers of obsessive calorie counting."

"The performances by Courtenay and Rampling are excellent. They look and act the part of an old married couple, used to each other's habits and quirks. This is an effective drama about a gathering storm in an old relationship."

"Like the best movies often do, ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" leaves audiences with a complex set of emotions, and with a hard-to-define hint of the profound."

"Probably one for those already enamoured with its creator, though there are numerous fascinating threads to untangle from this baroque tapestry if one has the patience."

"Herzog's film may not be the final word on Gorbachev, but it is affectionate and candid and leaves audiences in a melancholy mood about the sometimes short-lived nature of reform."

"Gunpowder Milkshake still has its moments of fun, but the whole bloody affair is just missing a heart and a bit of soul."
"This is no doubt the first of many movies that will struggle to tell the stories of a war that's far from over, and even if the tale is imperfectly told, it commands our attention."

"Exhausting and exhilarating, it's an inspirational saga."
"Mitchell reshapes tried-and-true scare conventions - teens in peril, a relentless malevolent force, jarring soundtrack - into an unexpectedly unique creepfest. And his riffs on sex and adulthood are refreshing in their allegorical complexity."

an intriguing existential space oddity

...the film would've been vastly improved had it been trimmed down to 90 minutes.
"It's a beautiful, melancholy film, and makes you begin to wonder if Karl Marx didn't have a point."
"This enigmatic, poetic film, co-directed by brothers Ramon and Silvan Zürcher, instils intimations of the cosmic into a deliberately ordinary narrative frame."
"2017's best feature film...a masterpiece, an emotionally affecting epic. Campillo saves his most provocative moment for last, an astounding depiction of love, death and the fight for life."

Ly is a deft orchestrator of story - and chaos.
A messed-up way to spend Mother's Day

The working title was Ship of Fools but should have been Abbott and Costello Take Some Speed.

An endearing Tibetan drama about loving others and giving up one's attachments.
"Inspiring, if Harrowing, For Sama Is for All of Us."
"For fans who ask for nothing more than something upbeat and friendly, it should satisfy, even if it isn't long remembered."

Horror fans will love the way it delivers on the genre with some inventive artistic flourish.

The movie is clearly intriguing in ways it may not have intended.
"It's rare that a movie that is concerned with issues currently in the headlines is more than that, but Aki Kaurismaki's touching and funny The Other Side of Hope, which focuses on the migrant crisis in Europe, pulls it off."
The Help has so much heart it's easy to feel both sorrow and enjoyment while watching such an emotional film.
Julie & Julia is a delectable cinematic concoction about two food-loving women.

The film's heart is Magdiel and the modest dreams that get him through the day but may also be the death of him.
The story twists beautifully and shockingly. The ending is brilliant. Skillfully directed by Jordan Scott.

The new film hints mischievously at the kind of dysfunction that would truly bring the Brady bunch up to date.

A very frank and gritty story about two brothers.
"""The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby: Them"" is worth seeing, if only for the way the camera lingers on Jessica Chastain as if she's a silken magnet."

"Lohman adapts to the changes required of her, but the actress and director Peter Kosminsky never get the audience to break through the wall her character erects"

"There may be much that is familiar, but with this version Wright nevertheless manages to be both reverent and innovative, with more than a dash of ... panache."
"A well-crafted tearjerker with a grown-up performance from Zac Efron. If you don't mind risking dehydration, it's the movie for you."
The deliriously demented 1960s Japanese show 'Johnny Sokko and His Flying Robot' proves to be a stronger influence on 'Pacific Rim' than any Godzilla movie.
... A suspense masterpiece ...
"""Happy being weird, at least giving the film some character when the storyline is too poorly executed to pick up the slack."""
"Weitz's rousing satire is no dream: It's the mad, mad real world of America in the year 2006."
"On the surface a literate werewolf thriller, the subtext of Mike Nichols' Wolf is a sharp critique about what it takes to succeed in the cutthroat corporate world."
"Efficient and highly effective in its style, relying on sound, creepy production design, and the men's own fear and misjudgment to create the sense of pervasive doom."
"Yesterday fulfills its modest ambitions with warmth and gentle humor. It wouldn't, however, make any impact if it were magically erased from existence."
"This beautiful 2K restoration...features the original intertitles while simulating the color tinting and toning of the original not seen since the 1920's...Unveiled at the 2016 Berlin Film Festival, Kino Lorber's release is a real treat for cinephiles."
The wonders never stop.
"As Michele, Huppert contains literal volumes."

An intriguing if rather run-of-the-mill feature debut for writer-director Yannick Saillet.
"A well made, atmospheric British thriller with terrific performances from a superb cast, though it's a little undermined by some casting issues and the script falters towards the end."

"For those seeking a wickedly dark little confection, Thoroughbreds should prove a diverting watch; but those looking for anything deeper will find a lot left to be desired."
"Pushes the idea of the capricious monarch through the far reaches of comedy and almost into tragedy. Colman embodies sublimely the punch-drunk confusion of a woman unsure whether she's child or adult, plaything or puppet-master."
"The sort of romance that doesn't come around too often&#151;intelligent without being saccharine, heartfelt without being condescending."
If you've seen 'You Can Count on Me' you have a pretty good idea where 'The Skeleton Twins' is headed in its somewhat didactic approach to celebrating the unbreakable bonds siblings share. Yet you admire it just the same.
"This rip-roaring slice of sci-fi excess remains Arnold Schwarzenegger's most satisfying film since his breakthrough hit, The Terminator."
"Landon is focused on delivering a wild ride that holds together surprisingly well, despite the increased narrative complication."
"Heloise and Marianne, and the way their ardor is allowed to slowly unfold onscreen is both heartwarming and, given the dismal prospects for a future together, heartbreaking."

It&#8217;s an appealing film&#44; but not one that goes beyond what most viewers will be expecting&#46;
Bong Joon-ho does an exemplary job balancing a mystery with both humorous and dramatic elements.
Has a few scares up its sleeve ...

"Anxiety inducing imagery aside, I already want to watch this flick again."
"Set in the ruthlessly competitive ballet world, Black Swan is a trashy melodrama with a glossy artsy treatment, but it's gripping due to its speed and Natalie Portman's Oscar-caliber performance."
"As remakes go, Disney's latest might just be their best one yet, soaring to such stratospheric heights I almost can't help but be amazed."
"It's quaint, a little rustic but magical in its own way."
Ant-Man is great; an optimistic jaunt with plenty of cleverness and oodles of joy. Yet another feather in Marvel Studio's increasingly peacocked cap.
As we all know&#44; leaky containers can result in zombies&#44; as in The Return of the Living Dead&#44; homicidal maniacs&#44; as in The Crazies&#44; or a mind leech&#44; as in Mind Leech&#46;
"It's not quite a Hamilton movie, but it'll still blow you all away."
"As much of a pleasure as it is to watch Washington, Davis and Henderson interact, the film loses steam as it enters the final third."
"in Mr. Saturday Night, Billy Crystal nimbly makes the big leap from amiable (if sometimes irritating) funny man to serious, but not-too-serious filmmaker."
Its blend of speed and music makes 'Baby Driver' one of the year's best films.
"Talladega Nights is as good as a summer comedy about NASCAR has any right to be, with fine actors tucked into every nook and cranny."
"It has a light, shaggy charm, and De Niro is at his most winningly comical."
The Pianist is Polanski's best film.
"...the movie remains watchable even through the sporadic lulls within the narrative, something that's due almost entirely to Gervais' almost ridiculously entertaining performance."
"Maybe, the story spends too much time preaching, but Mascaro holds tight to his credo, aiming at the Brazilian conservatism with irony."
VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN is an enjoyable - if more than a bit silly - take on the classic story.
"[A] rich, fun and fascinating film experience."
"Senna feels a touch too short to be fully realized -- but then again, so was Ayrton Senna's life."
"It ... is worth watching for its crackerjack opening and the strength of its young cast, but mainly because of its inherent promise of (possibly) better things to come."
"I loved this, it's hilarious, heart warming and a little stroke of genius.."
"Shanghai Noon feels both like a flashback to an earlier time of more innocent pictures, and also slightly predictive of the vanguard of colourful comic-book cinema to come."
"Tully is worth a look for its true-to-life characters, its sensitive acting, its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer Hilary Birmingham."
traces the end of an era in muted colors and a somber mood sparked by dry humor&#8230; quiet gem of a film
"A Miracle of Miracles examines both the development of the much loved ""dark musical"" and its enduring popularity for audiences all around the world."
Syrup does nothing to challenge the stereotype but instead embraces it in an outlandish farce.
[Brown] collects some fascinating stories.
Zootopia excels on so many levels that it stands with the finest of the Disney classics.

Sentiment is explained by science as the family impulse that motivates so many Steven Spielberg stories is revealed to be an evolutionary imperative in this near-perfect action-adventure.
"Ducournau eschews jump scares and instead focuses on tone, never allowing the audience to fully relax by peppering even what appear to be quotidian transition scenes with little reminders of the macabre."

"This last half of Lloyd's latest may not have a soothing effect upon people afflicted with nervous disorders... there are genuine shocks in Safety Last, some that can only be described by seeing them."
...a somber and contemplative study of a disenfranchised British man's journey of self-discovery via the bodily functions of a female dog over a period of 14-years.
This might be the best film of 2008.
Great seeing this portrait of a conductor who has just done some amazing things with the kids and adult musicians hes worked with. 
"[Beirut] is definitely a step up, with a stronger cast, led by Jon Hamm and Rosamund Pike, and a more polished screenplay."
"It shouldn't come as a surprise that Cody wrote the script after having her own third child, or that this excellent ode to self-care ranks among her finest, most mature pieces of work."
has stood the test of time to remain as funny today as anything Hollywood is producing now.
"Villeneuve's Dune takes a bit of time to set up the necessary palace intrigue and family dynamics before finding its shape as a relentless, propulsive chase movie."
"With Flushed Away, Aardman [Animations] has moved away from a guy and his dog to a girl and her mouse, but they're almost just as fun."
"[VIDEO] You can't relive the heady days and nights of Manhattan's club scene, but you can soak up some of the flavor. You'll also get a crash course in the city's muscle of political corruption that seems to increase with every passing year."
"This film barely brushes up against the many, many issues it raises, but those conversations can be had in the lobby, after the pleasure of watching an underappreciated artist finally get her due."

"Yes, it's a crowd pleaser and you can count me in as very much part of the crowd."
"Equity has injected women protagonists into a genre traditionally dominated by men, charging the Wall Street thriller with a buzz of female energy."
"Feels like no other film that you've seen before. It's cerebral and lugubrious, yet simple as a fairy tale."
One of the best originals that the platform has produced. [Full review in Spanish]
"While everyone remembers this film about an autistic man as Dustin Hoffman's Oscar-winning triumph, it is equally Tom Cruise's."
"It's not entirely clear how much of Big Game is funny on purpose, but it hardly matters when the action is so slick and the dialogue so ripe."
"(Director David) Fincher and (screenwriter Steven) Zaillian have visualized a cold, dreary and ugly Sweden that draws you in against your better instincts"
"Unpredictable, richly crafted, and beautifully written, The Drop is like the best liquor from the top shelf: it goes down hard and harsh, but it hangs on and gets its hooks right into you."
Gray keeps his picture interesting with a handful of inspired action scenes
The Oscar-nominated Rear Window isn&apos;t just one of Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s best films but one of the greatest thrillers ever made&#46;
"Chris Peckover's Christmas horror comedy is a deft melding of ""Scream"" and ""Home Alone"" that takes a surprisingly nasty turn in its last act...he really excels in his direction of his young cast"
"Mathieu Kassovitz is making a determined challenge for the stylish French sci-fi thriller crown of Luc Besson with this highly effective, highly charged action movie, even though he has had to rather mangle the novel on which it is based"
"[I]ts daffy, otherworldly story, rehearsing but not rehashing Stillman's frankly reactionary instincts, resounds less for its charming gaggle of collegiate women than for its dramatization of self-deception and the despair of depression."
A riveting and quirky movie about the aftershocks of 9/11 in the lives of a group of people still in denial a year later.
This contradiction - an activist for social justice with a blue-blooded partner - is sadly never explored.
"A timeless story about how the whole world is a potential threat to women, and even the smallest interactions can be loaded with unbearable consequences."
"Such an accurate, humble and kind autopsy. [Full Review in Spanish]"
It's an achingly poignant meditation on passion and loneliness in oxygen-choked Kuala Lumpur.
"Great documentaries, of which this is one, need great subjects, and Mr. Honnold fills the bill; he's thoughtful, funny, articulate, self-reflective and fatalistic to a scary degree."
"Adheres to the dumb/smart approach of other classics such as Airplane! and The Naked Gun. Opens strong, gets a lot of funny jokes in and then loses steam heading into the finale, but a worthy early horror parody nonetheless"
"Will appeal mostly to those who love theater and relish the opportunity to see a production being built, scene by scene."
"The craftsmanship of ""A War"" is unimpeachable. Tight shots and jittery camera work give the film an immediate, intimate feel."
"Ayers's warmest film to date finds meaning and depth in its ""I love you, man"" exchanges and rarely goes too long without staging some daring detective work and videogame ultraviolence."
"More than a narrative, the film is a study in visual ways to convey the ""swimmy,"" unreal sensations of love at first sight."
"Detroit is a gut-punch of a movie, one that pulls you in to the ugliness lying beneath the American id."
A slick and stylish horror comedy which delivers on both fronts.
"The Iperess File is a thriller set in a recognisable London where espionage is a seedy business conducted, not by impregnable Bonds, but by men as scared and venal as anyone else."
"Writer-director Sofia Coppola has produced a small-scale movie that exalts old-fashioned movie-making qualities, yielding a refreshingly understated alternative to a sea of summer blockbusters."
"Kulig dazzles as the poised, fearless, unpredictable Zula. Like a little dynamite she's ready to light up any scene with the sheer force of her joy, rage or pain."
This is an inspirational film about perseverance.
"Solidly telling in its methodical truth, Green's film is unassumingly dazzling in its low-key observations. The Assistant is impressively potent without the overstated exclamation of acrimony."
Director Sollett adds a humanistic layer of insight and wisdom to the story that transcends teen-pic formulas.
One of the best films of the year-it salutes openness and respect for life as antidotes to the use of violence to deal with the uncertainty and insecurity of our times.
The final 20 minutes of the film prove once again that what you can't see is infinitely more frightening than what you can..leaves you goosey and tense.
Funny when it needs to be. I don't know what more you can ask from the third installment of a series that has gone further than anyone reasonably could have expected.
"Politics aside, Herzog uses a realistic tone to depict a high-energy capture and escape."
"Like most of Grisham's stories, the set-up is better than the wrap-up, but this is a cast that knows how to satisfy, even when the material doesn't."
...a perfectly watchable (yet undeniably overlong) entry in an almost remarkably consistent series...
"As the characters get more intimate, so too does the film, with McCormack and, especially, Thompson cutting through the film’s more mechanical execution to deliver rounded portraits of people yearning for human connection in a judgmental world."
"The film is effective even when didactic, and Munn is terrific."
"For Daniel Craig the world of Bond could not be more far away: if his East European accent wobbles at times to Liev Schreiber's more authentic vocal, he looks the part of a man who can both kill and care."
"Adam Brody keeps the unnamed protagonist distant, strangely blank, as if part of his problem is his lack of any real personality of his own, prompting him to parasitise the charismatic women he meets and try to substitute scandalous behaviour for depth."
May be the finest thriller/romance hybrid of the new century.
"Its vision is unique and harrowing, its song hits to the heart."
"...two terrific bad guys. Banderas and Zeta-Jones are sexy and funny. Even with too many ridiculous fights, this is a lot of fun."
"It's a story designed to play the heartstrings like a fiddle, extracting sighs and sobs from willing viewers with surgical precision."
"The only slipup is a forgivable one. Jackson continues to be reluctant to leave a world he has so magnificently created. At a little over three hours, King Kong is a bit of a bum-number."
"There are plenty of great things about American Honey, but when stretched out to an incomprehensibly epic length, it is hard to see it as anything other than wasted potential."
"The film has grace, rhythm and music for a while with the story of the young man who only yearns to escape the crime world to rebuild his life. [Full review in Spanish]"
"It's no Jaws, but The Shallows is still a viciously, violently fun wave to ride."
"Delivers a hell of a lot of thrills as an R-rated romp that's refreshingly standalone, not trying to set up any sequels."
"Boyle -- and maybe Sorkin, though the domineering Sorkinese makes it hard to surmise -- is doing something smarter, even outright subversive."
"There are times in Christopher Nolan's somnolent crime caper where you'll find yourself recognizing moments from your own subconscious on the screen, to a thrilling, frightening and ultimately inspiring effect."
Taylor-Joy and Cooke are top-notch.
"The movie evaporates in the mind, but Stewart and Eisenberg have real movie-star chemistry."
A terrific picture crouched in the centre of a blasted Icelandic winter.
That moment where we see Captain Marvel in her full glory punching holes through the sky letting the audience know every girl can fly&#63; That moment Captain Marvel absolutely delivers&#46;
"The contrast in the acting styles of Pacino, De Niro and Pesci are predictable, yet gripping in this mob drama. Director Martin Scorsese is in his element directing this finely tuned 3 and a half hour lavish production."
"With some cool superhero action, Megamind is mildly amusing for the most part, but it feels like it could have been much better."
"Here, with everything that he's ever cared about on the line, Hunt proves why he's summer's most valuable action hero."
"""Scream 4"" lacks the qualities that would make it a masterpiece, but it testifies to the cyclical nature of commercial storytelling in sharp, nearly timeless fashion."
"The premise is ridiculously simple - take out your phone and film family members as they chat - but when your family is as expressive and poetic as Panahi's, most of your job is done for you."
Peter Dinklage is excellent as the mob's chief lawyer.
"Surprisingly candid, comprehensive and, most of all, emotional expos of the wrestling business."
"Follows [Pekar's] journey with originality, humor and humanity"
"If a movie can be defined by the strength of its villain, Avengers Infinity War is a giant. Towering over the spectacle is Josh Brolin's evil despot Thanos, whose striking capture motion performance and physicality comes close to stealing the film."
Iron Man is an action sci-fi blockbuster extravaganza that provides cartoon thrills for thinking people. It's the best movie of its kind since the second Spider-Man movie four years ago.
"The director's affectionate warts-and-all portrait of his milieu and subculture is blistering, cogently capturing how England's early-'80s skinhead movement was driven less by blind racial intolerance than by intense socio-economic tensions."
"The movie is self-pity disguised as self-sacrifice (he'll do anything for his fans) but it's also, by any measure, often funny."
This is terrific film-making - enough to bring a rush of blood to the head.
"Whether you know it or not, kids, you've now got your own generation's Close Encounters of The Third Kind."
Athlete A raises a lot of questions about the USAG's practices.
"The Unborn is a culty midnight movie that, like far more such films than we tend to credit, has a brain whose synapses are constantly firing away just beneath all the gore."
"Cove is a stirring call to arms, providing the damning dolphin massacre argument forcefully and creatively. I can't say the film will change the world, but it certainly will make those trips to Sea World more awkward."
"Maguire's otherworldly coolness suits the observer drawn into a story he might prefer only to watch. DiCaprio is persuasive as the little boy lost impersonating a tough guy, and Mulligan finds ways to express Daisy's magnetism and weakness."
"""The Day after Tomorrow is junk, but it's not a rip-off. Emmerich sincerely wants to entertain you, which is more than you can say for most of his Hollywood peers."""
"Kumail Nanjani and Issa Rae's chemistry and ease of dialogue make The Lovebirds feel like a throwback to corny, yet entertains Golden-Age rom coms. Unicorn suits, milkshake monologues and ride share jokes are worth the ride."
"An accomplished, insightful, touching film."
&quot;The Lighthouse&quot; has echoes of Melville and Lovecraft as well as Coleridge and Greek mythology&#44; all stirred together in a psychedelic stew&#44; or a cup of turpentine and honey&#46; The honey is the film&apos;s sumptuous aesthetic&#46;
"It willingly follows its characters into the muck of brotherly love, misery, impulse and idiocy."
"A lot of The Descendants is affecting, but its mushier tone is often less emotionally resonant than the bitter sarcasm of Payne's earlier work."
"It has dryly obscene, laugh-out-loud lines, and its portrait of Hollywood as a giant anxiety attack is fused by De Niro, who musters a desperate, nagging warmth beneath his grumbly facade."
"A Monster Calls may seem like a simple fantasy film, but it goes beyond that to tackle a very real tragedy - losing someone. Word of advice: bring a lot of tissues to this one."
You won't be able to dismiss this movie as easily as Etienne ignores Lolita.
a masterpiece of action adventure science fiction fueled by a terrific international cast...Joon-ho has more on his mind than startling imagery and violence and his climax is both breathtaking and an emotional gut punch.
I Served the King of England ends up a curious combination of raunchy merriment and malignant undercurrents.
... a dramedy thatll have you laughing through tears.
A tight-fisted and paranoid mini-classic.
"Bielinsky's script is slick and fiendishly clever, with seemingly a twist a minute."
"Forget motion-capture, this is motion-rapture. Meanwhile, Oscar-winning composer Michael Giacchino (Up) finds some extraordinary piano notes to emphasise contemplative silence as much as imminent threat."
This is an almost apocalyptic tale of thwarted emotion - love cut short - set in a pitiless land of delusions.
"It's too much of a stretch to say Venom is ""good,"" but it's certainly not terrible, and maybe worth seeing for Hardy alone."
"One of the broadest, silliest (yet somehow still endearing) stoner comedies in a while, indulging the adult members of the cast with particular gusto."
"It's just, like ... well, a lot like real life for 20-somethings."
"Through her constant swings between the public and the private, Whitney tears the icon and reveals a soul. [Full Review in Spanish]"
It's Levy and his chemistry with Jackson that keeps The Man from being ho-hum.
Wright remarkably shows you how instead of iron fists as tools&#44; we see Edgerton&#8217;s Mark uses something entirely different &#8212; empathy&#46;
"Nichols ... tells the Lovings' story in a way that feels immediate and modern, and not just like a history lesson."
"The movie is poppy, clever and more than enjoyable, but Posey is something else altogether. She's a revelation."
"This is an, at times, terrifying film that, refreshingly, does not rely on cheap jump scares."
Nymphomaniac isn't as much about female power as the dialogue occasionally suggests; it's more about being misunderstood because of the things you choose (or are compelled) to pursue.
"This good natured film feels like an episode of Nashville mixed with an episode of Friday Night Lights, two television shows I happen to enjoy, in spite of their soapiness."
Luck doesn&#8217;t break a lot of new ground&#46; But the movie has some creative elements and likable characters&#46; The animation is solid&#44; though not eye popping&#46; The voice cast is good&#46; &#46;&#46;&#46; It&#8217;s a rare movie these days that has both a G-rating and a plot&#46;
"Olivier Martinez makes the kind of visceral impression Brad Pitt made in Thelma and Louise, but it's Gere's layered performance that makes Unfaithful a sophisticated, interesting adult drama."
"Marketed as a guitar summit between The Edge, Jimmy Page, and Jack White, Davis Guggenheim's affectionate, intermittently insightful behind-the-music doc is more electric triptych than meeting of the minds."
"Its nastiness sings, instead of stings."
"The protagonists are likable, have charismatic chemistry, and are portrayed brilliantly. You will love to hate the well crafted antagonist who creates obstacles for our leads."
"For a film that's just shy of being three hours long, it never felt bloated; every sequence seemed to have its place, and at the right pace..."
"Harari chooses to create a psychological portrait of his central character, using images rather than explanations of ideology to tap into Onoda’s mind-set."
"While King Arthur is not Guy Ritchie gold, it is an entertaining film that serves up the right amount of thrills, spills and wit."
"This powerful, heartfelt and important drama from one of the great names in world cinema deserves to be seen."
You know how much of a guy flick this is? There's no women in it.
A profoundly sexist and eminently hummable 1954 CinemaScope musical with some terrific athletic Michael Kidd choreography and some better-than-average direction by Stanley Donen.
A Hidden Life is a commanding piece of cinema that lingers long after you've left the theatre.
Something that the whole family can love.
A great big hug of a film.
"Gook may not come close to the electric greatness of Lee's 1989 film but, as a gesture in its direction, it's alive with biting promise."
Arkadina is one of literature's most narcissistic mothers - which is saying something - and yet Bening makes her damnably human.
"Friendsgiving is not destined to be a holiday classic, but it shows that with a good script and a talented cast, even an old formula can result in a surprisingly entertaining movie."
"Rosi celebrates the harsh beauty of the island in many long shots, as well as the humanity and patience of the islanders."
"A good action yarn, burdened from time to time by excessive dialogue, about the professional rodeo circuit and the hardy horse-tamers who inhabit it."
"A sterling effort in the eventually overplayed ""found footage"" genre."
Patrice Ch&#233;reau's startling drama recounts the dissolution of a marriage of a couple (Pascal Greggory and Isabelle Huppert) from the haute bourgeoisie.
"A pop-punk re-up of the lively, amusing 1976 Disney original that stands as a credibly entertaining family film due chiefly to the presence of its two deft, personable comediennes."
Features a strong performance from the criminally underrated Robert Pattinson.
"Reilly is fantastic, the music is right on, and the commentary is obnoxiously accurate, so while Walk Hard may not go to 11, it's definitely worth a seven or an eight."
"If this truly is the end of this tale on the big-screen, it's going out in grand fashion."
A solid laugh machine...
There is a magnificent introspection about the dichotomy between dream and memory. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Griffith has honestly never been funnier, and Play the Game is a delightful, thoroughly entertaining romantic comedy that reminds us all just why we fell in love with him in the first place."
"The deck is stacked, and the disingenuousness is profound, but director John Lee Hancock is good at saving his big schmaltz cards to play at the end."
"The picture is also further evidence that no matter how beautifully rendered it is or how complex the emotional context, and Big Fish & Begonia is both beautiful and complex, any shot of a sea creature leaping over a human will invoke Free Willy."
"While Platoon is easily one of the year's finest films, I'm not sure if it's the long-awaited definitive Vietnam movie, as some early reviews have suggested. But it is the gamest attempt so far to explain how America suffered a humiliating defeat."
"Gilligan has proven, again and again, that he is a skilled storyteller in this universe, and if a post-finale finale had to exist, El Camino is a lovely coda that puts Jesse's tortured soul to rest, in a way."
"A monumental mockumentary from Brit cinema's premier director/actor double act. True, daft, emotional, hilarious."
Of interest today strictly for Lon Chaney's bell-ringing performance.
"Renewed purpose to this part two, finding Catching Fire skillfully communicating beats of unrest and despair, locating a way to help the ongoing franchise settle in as an energizing story of an underground uprising."
Marcin Wrona's Demon is spooky fun that unexpectedly mines the same collective guilt that powered Pawel Pawlikowski's brilliant historical drama Ida.
"Welcome back Renée, we missed you."

"It's worth checking out, though it's unlikely to be anyone's repeat favorite."
"What a firebrand Lady Gaga embodies in this movie. Surrounded by renowned actors, she commands our focus. Even as the plot slows to a crawl, when she appears, the sparks fly."
"If you go into this movie expecting something like ""John Wick"" crossed with ""Gunda,"" prepare to have your expectations upended as ""Pig"" is a melancholy, almost spiritual, meditation on what makes life worth living."

It's a human drama which stays with you for quite some time afterwards.
"Luckily, Chadwick Boseman is the protagonist... it's thanks to him it is that we forget all of the story's mistakes a little bit. [Full review in Spanish]"
"It doesn't expose stupidity. That's what Cohen has done absolutely wonderfully in the past with his other characters. Now he's just acting stupid, with only some funny results."
"Although ""Triple 9"" was most likely just a paycheck film for all involved, its go-for-the-gut efficiency can't be denied."
"The movie is smart and funny, though ultimately it's less noteworthy as an entertainment than as a marketing concept."
"The David versus Goliath battle for justice - the abuse victims versus the stonewalling by the Vatican - does not end as I expected. Then again, with the Church's not so enviable track record, maybe it is just what I expected."
"Ficarra and Requa direct some fascinating sequences, including a long, brisk montage of illegal acts that shows us how Nicky's team operates."
"Leave No Trace, in the biggest of ironies, leaves the greatest of traces upon us."
"Writer-director Leslye Headland has made a film that is saucy and sweet, for the boys and for the girls -- an R-rated Seinfeld, not that there's anything wrong with that."
Sophisticated sci-fi - stunningly well-crafted and acted.
"The first thing you will notice as you watch this film, and be distracted by, is how much Washington sounds like his father, Denzel Washington. Once you get over this, the story draws you in."
Does an insult carry the same weight of a physical assault?
"Lubitsch sees the round of coincidences as a game of cruel destiny, albeit one that's played on the world stage against a backdrop of looming war."
"Every year, there are a handful of pleasant and unpleasant surprises in multiplexes. Count Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle among the former."
"The movie shows how you can rationalise the ends justifying the means, but you don't know where the ends will take you."
American Made sure makes zipping around in planes loaded with ill-gotten jewels seem like a lot of fun.
&#46;&#46;&#46;Even though Unbreakable&apos;s superhero side is shaky&#44; Shyamalan&apos;s fourth film is ultimately a success&#8212;as best seen in the strength of the Dunn family story and a genuinely exciting climactic fight&#46; 
"Innovative, many layered and prevocative but very, very dated."
"Sissako's gorgeous fourth feature reflects upon the role religion currently plays in Africa, and the foundational clash of cultures that shaped the continent."
There are moments in Zathura of pure delight and wonder.
"A searching examination of middle-class complacency and gender roles in an age of us-or-them individualism, this assured Swedish drama is the kind of film that's hard to watch and harder still to tear your eyes away from."
A fantastic experience with one hell of a darkly sense of humor horror fans will appreciate.
"While Gordon-Levitt leans hard on an overcompensatory Timberlake scowl, he's kept real by the rest of the ensemble."
"Danielle Macdonald is a guzzling martini guzzling medium, LUcas Hedges is giving you bored socialite son and Michelle Pfeiffer is stone cold spectacular in French Exit"
The most visually expressive of Noah Baumbach's oeuvre.
"A grounded, sympathetic and often grimly comic portrayal of motherhood."
"Abrangente, jornalisticamente impecável, inteligente, complexo e socialmente responsável - mas também repetitivo e mais longo do que o ideal."

Odd feminist fun.

"Georges' irreversible decision may be courageous, but it requires no sacrifice on the part of his creator: for Haneke, it's business as usual."
Heath Ledger is great.

"

A rapturously seductive slow burn watch.

Charming.

An overlong but fascinating look at the life of a forgotten innovator of early rock'n roll
This is the work of a filmmaker blessed with the gift of chronicling the unbearable heaviness of being. He basks in the redemptive glow of thematic ambition.

The type of delicious indulgence that will ultimately make your stomach churn
Everything you've hoped for and more! [Full Review in Spanish]

It's a WW2 B-movie with OVERLORD vibes that keeps Chloë Grace Moretz alive using FAST & FURIOUS logic. Do with that what you will.

Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit demands more than a single viewing to catch everything -- and audiences of all ages won't mind one bit.

The end is just the icing on a perfectly designed and cooked cake. [Full Review in Spanish]

"It's not scary-horror, but it should scare the stuffing out of anybody who has contemplated their own failing memory. That prospect is far scarier than anything Freddy Krueger ever threw at us."
Codirectors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders understand more about visualizing the joy of flight than James Cameron ever will.
"Hugely startling, challenging, and mesmerizing, perhaps even a masterpiece."

"The experience overall is like laughing down a gun barrel, a little bit tiring, a lot sick and maybe far too perverse for less jaded moviegoers."
John Wick has been a boogeyman&#44; the Baba Yaga&#44; an enigmatic cypher in the vein of so many cinematic assassins that came before him&#44; but most of all&#44; the franchise points out&#44; he&#8217;s simply a man who loved&#44; and was loved in return&#46;

"The timing for a movie like Stillwater could not be better, and hopefully there is a place for it in the ever-changing theatrical landscape."
"If the same story points were carried out with a heavier hand, this film would be booed off the screen as an absurdity; in the hands of the Duplasses, its quiet, quirky charms transform it into a disarming modern-day fable."
Not close to the insanely imaginative material from the show's heyday but still funny its own right

A slick and suspenseful landing until it fails to stick the landing.
There's lots of interesting stuff to chew on...it's never less than compelling.

Emasculation paranoia is alive and well.
"Refn is definitely a provocateur, but those audiences who enjoy being provoked should probably decide if they love it or hate it for themselves. We'll both be right."

"It's just a little too jarring to be top notch, but it sure is powerful."
Um grande exercício de lógica e técnica narrativa.

Each of the actors smoulders with quiet strength.
It&#8217;s a truly great blockbuster&#44; one that surpasses the earlier theater release in every conceivable way&#46;

"LaBute's films have much to say even if they can be overwhelming. Unlike action films you forget in an hour, his movies will stay with you for years afterwards, provoking thought and reflection."
"Mildly compelling and amusing, but somewhat uneven and dull. The sexy Trieste Kelly Dunn invigorates the film in a radiant, charismatic performance."
"Terrifically spooky and original, the film continues to feel completely modern despite being almost a quarter-century old."

"Less a horror film than a valentine, from a daughter to a father, and a sweet portrait of a man going gently into that good night."
"Combines a few lovable Hollywood icons, an admittedly goofball plot, some sweet-natured romance, and brilliant rapid-fire exchanges of breathless comedic dialogue."

Fun to watch!

"If a bracing brew of criminal connivance and exquisite bloodletting is to your liking, Takeshi certainly provides it."
"""Love is making someone who is sad feel happy,"" one girl says, answering an interviewer's question. ""Blood Brother"" showed me that love. I doubt I'll be the only one."

The Jungle Book is everything it was expected to be and so much more.

But something strange happens once Drew Barrymore shows up -- the movie starts getting good. Really good.

"Despite a predictable story and some awkward visuals, Giant Slayer is surprisingly entertaining - thanks to a hefty dose of well-timed humor and energetic performances."

The ending feels at odds with the rest of the film.
...a wonderful time warp movie with pace and style.
"Not content with a basic premise of crime and punishment, director Bong Joon Ho goes a step further, eventually corkscrewing off on a tangent that drags out the running time."
Turn your brain off and turn up the blood splatter.
"It just about works, but it's a long way from perfect."

"Away From Her isn't just a portrait of Alzheimer's. For a generation that doesn't have a lot of marital role models, it's also a lyrical portrait of what it means to stick with a person for the long run. There are no easy answers."
"Farhadi is one of those filmmakers whose personal style is as steadfast as Marvel's: allowing for a few cosmetic tweaks and squeaks each time, you generally know what you're going to get. And generally, it's very good."
"Mr. Bertino, who also wrote the undercooked script, sets the scene effectively, using his leads to give the story a sense of normalcy that he dismantles trick by genre trick."
"The late, great playwright August Wilson, whose ten plays dealt with the lives of African-Americans in different decades, would have radiated warm support for this unabashedly theatrical movie."
"Filled with casual betrayals, divided loyalties and enough story to spawn a franchise, The Villainess roars along like a runaway train and is a brilliant showcase for Kim, who kicks sand in the face of any Hollywood bad girl."
The performances are simply wonderful.

"These dizzying IMAX 3-D visuals truly are big-screen magic, taking us inside Petit's transcendent experience as he navigates his preternatural path, indulges his showman's flair, and - agh! - reclines to commune with the heavens."
Creators Dean Fleischer-Camp and Jenny Slate run the gamut of emotions ranging from hysterical laughter&#44; surprisingly poignant thematic moments&#44; and heartbreaking devastation
"As you plow through all two hours and 11 minutes, you realize Mank cares less about being a factual biopic on a silver-screen screenwriter and more about going back to those grand, glory days of Dream Factory-era Hollywood..."
"An icily slick and funny Florida urban thriller in the style of Carl Hiaasen, carried with great deadpan style by Paige."
"A great role for a truly great talent, who just happens to be in her 70s. The movie is just under 90 minutes, but Tomlin delivers in that short time. Her wise-cracking one-liners are tempered by a real sense of loss and vulnerability."
People is an utterly fascinating watch.

Bogart and Hepburn are truly amazing together.
"Most of what Mr. Tyrnauer serves up is not news, but to have it all in one place is to immerse oneself in a bilious lesson in history."
"With its mix of melancholy moments, abrupt violence and broadly played buffoonery, Zatoichi is very much a Kitano movie, yet he still treats the genre with respect."
Character study with a thoroughly European sensibility..the true pleasures are Clooney's study in stillness and Corbijn's striking images..a beautifully restrained performance.
Director Ron Howard and writer Akiva Goldsman have reached the apex of their careers with Mind.

"Ten years later, it's still flawed and still quite fascinating."
"At one point, Jude Law says, ""I find this disgusting but I can't help myself."" Me, too."

"This seventh film in the Planet of the Apes series rises to such ridiculous heights, it's impossible not to laugh out loud -- in a good way, in appreciation."
"Though replete with amusing situations and clever lines, its strongest suit is the delicately pitched comic performances of its actors, most especially star Kevin Kline."
"Along With the Gods: The Two Worlds is an inquisition into human flaws, using Ja-hong as a vehicle to explore how they can be redeemed as such."
"""Catch Me"" feels capable of charming the masses with star power, a pop-induced score and sentimental moments that have become a Spielberg trademark."
"Chadwick Boseman is so formidable that, were the film itself just a bit better, he would eventually be basking in the same sort of year-end accolades that greeted Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles and Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash. Who knows, he may yet."

"In spite of the pervasive melancholy, ""Stan & Ollie"" also carries a sweetness and dignity that ennobles its subjects. A lot of that has to do with the warm performances from Coogan and Reilly, who disappear into their roles."
One of the insights writer-director Johnson brings to the movie is a political and cultural awareness of what is going on in today's society - a denigration and suspicion of outsiders.

Brigsby Bear will reaffirm your belief in the positive powers of imagination.
A solid Christmas-themed dysfunctional family drama is enlivened by its superior cast of fine Latino stars.
"It's a very tasteful heart-tugger - a drama of disarmingly level-headed empathy that glides along with wit, assurance, and grace, and has something touching and resonant to say about the current climate of American bullying."
Beneath the viscera and grue is a tender and affecting tale of first love and discovery&#46; It&#8217;s as elegant as carnal and carnivorous&#44; and it&#8217;ll take a bite out of your heart if you let it&#46;
"Talk to Her is a sad falsetto ballad, holding onto hope like a dove cupped in two gentle hands in the midst of blood-splattered bullhorns and slow death."
"It's a crazy amount of ground to cover, but only rarely does 13th sacrifice clarity for cinematic energy."
"A hard-hitting film, The Nightingale never quite reaches the heights its aiming for."
"Genuinely inspirational on many levels, this film was a surprisingly emotional ride on and off the track with another pitch-perfect outing from our national treasure Sam Neill."

"Fauci has an actual structural focus that's smartly considered and interesting, even if it left me with myriad questions."
Sean Penn does a great job.
"Equal parts sultry, humorous, and heartbreaking, Hustlers brings a needed female perspective to an industry poorly portrayed by Hollywood. Constance Wu and Jennifer Lopez are a lock for Oscar nominations."
An impressive action sequel that stays away from everything other than pure escapism&#46; And that&apos;s great&#33;
"Red Penguins is a wild and crazy story well told, especially in the first half, by Polsky, who is emerging as a gifted documentarian."

Clever but manipulative.
"If you can get past the film's few potholes, it has the power to really make you squirm."
"[An] intelligent, thought-provoking political drama. Underpinning it all is classy filmmaking from Jason Reitman...who gets a fine ensemble cast moving to the same beat."
Google my words: it's a winner. It may not be as great as Wedding Crashers but this re-teaming of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson was worth the 8-year wait.
"A mesmerizing, artistic and highly entertaining piece of work from one of our foremost filmakers."
"Incredibly satisfying, because it feels like every moment in the first chapter eventually does pay off, some in quite emotional ways."

You're unlikely to find a more droll look at obsession and lunacy than Deerskin

"Scott manages to fill in the finer brushstrokes of all those characters and still fit the kind of bravura action set pieces he's known for; the fight scenes are breathlessly, bone-crunchingly brutal."
"This is a dizzyingly inventive, postmodernist exercise in breaking down cinema's 'fourth wall', Keaton playing with the possibilities of the medium and cramming an unbelievable quantity of gags and ideas into the film."
The Wind Rises undoubtedly stands out as a film with an incredible amount of passion and inspiration behind it&#44; bringing to life a story that stays with audiences and engages them on a deeply personal level&#46;

"Death in Venice occasionally suffers from Visconti's artistic overindulgence, but the film's strengths are also paradoxically tied up in its helmer's unwavering eye for detail."
"Despite flaws (it's overlong and too theatrical, betraying its stage origins), this stylishly made cat-and-mouse thriller with strong social class overtones boasts great performances from Olivier and Michael Caine."
"What makes this such a moving family drama are the complicated characters that this talent cast creates, and the relationships between them it so effectively explores."
Anyone with a weakness for song-and-dance dementia on the level of Forbidden Zone and Cannibal! The Musical will find all this irresistible.
"This comedy of a boy and his talking bear - which plays like a long episode of ""Family Guy"" - is basically like watching Seth MacFarlane and Mark Wahlberg hanging out. Happily they're both pretty funny."
Amusing documentary duel at the video arcade.
"Strange and a little awkward, ""Secret Window"" nonetheless is worth a look."
"When a movie is written and filmed as part of the writer-actor's effort to save his own life and slim down, the movie feels, to a certain extent, critic-proof."
"Se acerta ao trazer um Bond mais amadurecido, amargurado e auto-consciente, peca terrivelmente por elementos que beiram o trash, como alguns efeitos visuais pavorosos e uma atuao sensual, mas absurda, de Janssen."
"The story is programmatic and the indie stylings feel tired but Handsome Devil is a winning, enjoyable call for individuality."
"Shyamalan demonstrates a mastery over the form of the mean and lean psycho-thriller, aided in no small party by the performances of McAvoy, Taylor-Joy and Buckley, and smooth-yet-unsettling camera work by cinematographer Michael Gioulakis."
This haunting coming-of-age film is set in a country that itself is coming of age.
"It's one of those films where you feel the authority right away: This movie knows its characters, knows its story, and knows exactly how it wants to tell us about them."
Adapted brilliantly and faithfully from the surprise best-selling novel by Judith Guest.
"We're just pleased to have a family film in the truest sense of the word, one that's genuinely hilarious, touching and inventive to both kids and their parents"

"The 1962 version, starring Emmanuelle (Amour) Riva, is superior."
The delight and the exasperation of Eureka come from the same source: its willingness to take its time and explore every detour.

"This is finally a film that is better at mood than substance, that has its strongest hold on you when it's making the least amount of sense."
"Leave No Trace is a slow burn, and carefully constructed; the performances are measured and calm. There's no need to overplay the drama - the circumstances presented here are serious enough as they are."
"One of the great crime thrillers, the benchmark all succeeding heist films have been measured against, it's no musty museum piece but a driving, compelling piece of work, redolent of the air of human frailty and fatalistic doom."
"It's certainly a Spike Lee film, but no Spike Lee Joint. Still, he's delivered a pacy, vigorous and frequently masterful take on a well-worn genre."
Jeong sensitively gives her film an underlying sadness as the young women cope with the changes in their lives
"Darkly dazzling but, because of intense, sometimes terrifying imagery, it should be PG-13, not PG."

A deliciously bitter pill from the Coen brothers
"Michael Apted's 'self defense isn't murder' thriller may reek of familiarity like yesterday's garbage, but the intense chemistry between the leading actors actually makes the film work."
"Mary Poppins Returns is at its best when it gives way to the unbridled, and unselfconscious sincerity that a tale like this demands."
Its ability to take audiences to a completely different land and time may remind them of how they felt when they saw Star Wars or The Wizard of Oz for the first time.

"Broly sets up what could be the next phase of this Super era. If you've ever in your life loved anime and especially if you've watched Dragon Ball, go see this movie while it's in theaters and enjoy yourself as much as Goku enjoys fighting."
It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
"The special effects are more of the psychological nature, with nothing evil shown clearly but its presence always pervading."

Hair High is the actually the artist's most cohesive 'story' to date...which means it's only about 35% weirder than any other sort of animation out there.
"This blue-collar ""Ocean's Eleven"" is a smooth-running, pleasantly familiar crime caper. In a movie full of cons, the greatest may be how deceptively easy Steven Soderbergh makes the whole enterprise seem."
"...basically just sits there for a good long hour before it picks up any sensible speed. Is it all worth it, though? In ways."
[An] interesting exercise in style. [Full review in Spanish]
"The contrast between two very different characters who get along so well, is what makes ""Cha Cha Real Smooth"" an extremely charming experience. [Full review in Spanish]"

"Regardless of whether you recognize the names of Christopher Isherwood or Don Bachardy, this masterful documentary draws you into the men's lives like a star-studded bedtime tale."
"While Caught won't abduct everyone's attention, it's a strange, unique, and intense indie that will be welcomed by both sci-fi and horror fans alike."
"Take it for what it is: An old guy who gives himself one last juicy role as the flawed, haunted anti-hero, an old guy who's done this so often that he isn't above making himself look silly as well as heroic (he even croons the title song over the ending c"
"It's a slow effort, painfully so at times, but the reward is a sharp psychological study that ends up being the most interesting conflict in the movie."
Boogie Nights for Gen Z...
"Parts of the film are frustrating, and downright suspenseful, because Marija earns our respect while no one else gives her any. Thanks to Jaktait&#279;'s bracing performance, we know she also internalizes this hard-earned truth."
"Very violent, mostly in comic-book terms."
The cast ... manages to give thoughtful performances that salvage the film's integrity.
"The Fly seizes on our ingrained, instinctive horror of sexuality, the sense of shame that our fundamentally puritanical society can't help but teach us, and by confirming our worst fears, helps us, for a moment, to move beyond them."
"Ghosts of the Ozarks is not groundbreaking or ushering a new kind of terror, but it does have an impressive premise, worthy of appreciation in the wealth of knowledge of the genre, making it an independent horror film worthy enough to seek out."
"Melissa McCarthy gives the performance of her career and Richard E. Grant is terrific. Director Marielle Heller has a keen eye for detail from the bookshops to the bars, the film is bathed in authenticity."
"Although imperfect, it's engaging, thought-provoking stuff."
"The lean story-telling works well for its taciturn characters and spare settings, presented by cinematographer Amundsen, and well scored with assistance from Mastodon."
The Forever Purge is another powerfully political piece of action horror art from the hit franchise&#44; drawing on our current social strife for its scares&#46;

A classic gets even better.
"In some ways, Coppola improves on the original film, but at the very least the different actors make for a different dynamic."
"Room 237 is a fascinating study of what fans of the film believe, and it's an entertaining look at that world-especially if you're not immersed it in it everyday."
"It's hard to resist a satire, even when it wobbles, that insists the most unbelievable parts are the most true."
Close to an XL for me. It's a sequel that uses a rehash of storylines and characters that still actually held up.
"I'd rank being stuck in a big quiet house at night as one of life's most easily unnerving experiences, and this movie capitalizes on it."
No franchise like Scream has to constantly reinvent itself with meta narratives while also keeping direct connections to its original installments&#46; Scream VI is a mean&#44; nasty&#44; rollicking good time at the movies&#44; just as Wes Craven always intended&#46;

"Despite these frustrating moments where The Witches of the Orient feels designed for a different audience, one which doesn't need to either race to catch up or be calmed into tranquility, the story of the Japanese volleyball team is undeniably remarkable."
"Captures a raw and honest look at the feeling of being trapped in a life you never asked for, wanting so desperately to get yourself out of it, but realizing that you're probably stuck there for good."
"A clever, enjoyable movie, with enough thrills and laughs to keep all ages entertained!"
"As freewheeling and irreverent as the man himself, Saint Misbehavin' is that rare documentary whose flaws seem appropriate for its subject matter."
a wickedly funny and stylish take on a childrens classic that conjures family fun with a typically dark Roald Dahl edge. 
"A collage of emotions, shifting through scenes that are happy, silly, angry, sexy, even sad."
I seriously love this movie.
"A naturalistic, chat-heavy narrative that captures the difficulties wrought by the unimaginable trauma individuals face as they attempt to forge connections and find peace after war."
"An increasingly rich and accomplished comic still works for his laughs, with edge, antic energy and polished stage patter."
"""Spider-Man: Far from Home"" isn't really a superhero movie. It's a wholesome teen comedy disguised as a superhero movie."
This all-too-familiar gloom and doom tale is depressing and feels longer than the 104-minute running time. The acting is top drawer from the powerhouse cast of respected thespians.
"Deftly written by Richard Curtis and directed by the versatile Mike Newell, Four Weddings is as good as its word, breezily following a small circle of friends through every one of the events the title promises."
There are still good vampire movies being made. Like this one.
"At its core, watchable."
The Second Coming on a trash heap.
A moving documentary for the ages and a reminder of Gilda Radner's greatness both as a comic and as a human being.

"The story, about a young soldier who is torn between leaving the army and loyalty to his brothers at arms, is affecting and well acted ..."

It&#8217;s a traditional sci-fi horror picture that doesn&#8217;t break new ground outside of its slick advertising trick&#46; But is it really trying to break new ground&#63; I would argue it&#8217;s trying to make a fun&#44; intriguing &#8220;Cloverfield&#8221; installment&#46;

Monsters Inc. prequel is a fun college comedy for all ages.

"It's got some action, some romance, a few drips of comedy, and a lot of fascinating insight into a culture we know very little about."

"Michelle Williams delivers an Oscar-worthy turn as Marilyn Monroe, making the iconic actress her own rather than merely doing an impersonation."
Blood Quantum is the kind of standout zombie movie that should be talked about for years to come.
There is no such thing as a minor Terence Davies.
Gulager and screenwriters Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton have come up with some wittily nasty moments.

Vintage Sly in his best outing since Cop Land!
"James Mangold's well constructed and compelling script gives plenty of opportunity for this star powered cast to shine, in a fascinating town where corruption reigns."

"When [Emerald] Fennell finally arrives at her inevitable conclusion, you will be caught off-guard by her narrative dexterity as well as just how much badly-behaved white boys can all resemble versions of a young Brett Kavanaugh."
"It's hard to say the imperfections of ""Boy Erased"" should keep you from seeing the movie. The ideas presented in the film may seem outlandish and archaic but the final title cards inform us how relevant this movie is."
"Synecdoche, New York is for those who are true cineastes, connoisseurs of cinema who seek more than easy answers, paint-by-number plots and happy endings."
"This year's ARGO in that it's a smart, adult caper that has the potential to both score major awards and major box office. It's a blast from start to finish."

The only thing that I know for sure has ended with the Marvel Cinematic Universe is my patience.
"Matt Reeves delivers a standout Batman movie. It's a dark, alluring mystery that digs deep into Bruce Wayne's trauma, how it's shaped him and how he's choosing to move forward."
"There has been a lot of backlash by those accusing the boxer of lying, but that is not the point of this Tyson-Toback collaboration. It is Tyson's story, truth or not, from his viewpoint and that is what we get."

It's a high concept structure built with a lo-fi aesthetic that's populated by darkly comic performances lending a surreal dryness that captivates as the whole spirals out.

A gross-out comedy that makes its audience go 'awwww' as much as it goes 'ewwww.'
"Ducournau may have changed tack here, but it's another impressive, thought-provoking piece of work."

Tyson is most a revelation onscreen when he's captured with his children.

"With genius executive producer John Lasseter's stamp of approval on ""Finding Dory"", what's not to like?"
"Scream feels familiar, but it's unafraid of criticizing its existence while providing commentary on the new wave of horror and toxicity in fandom."
Any damage such revisionist history may impose on young minds is offset by the honestly inspiring thoughts Pocahontas offers.

Plenty for fans to chew over and enjoy. Non-fans should steer well clear.

...Colette is a film that is appropriate for this new era following the start of the Times Up movement.

Any A- or B- list actress would jump at the chance to work with the [screenwriters].
"Although it brings nothing new to the con-artist fold, or even anything thrilling, ""Focus"" is a seductive enough rehash that benefits from the built-in pleasures of the trade."
"...one of the most entertaining, laugh-out-loud funny, and unexpectedly touching efforts to come around in quite some time..."
"Regardless of its flimsy emotional interior, Ricki is a worthy addition in this year's growing canon of strong female-centred films, and it would be wise to remember Streep's stunning performance come awards season."
"The leisurely, indifferent pace of the film is probably why it is rated so poorly among young viewers ... It does have its rewards."
Colin Farrell is a super freaky vampire.
"Thompson's performance is compulsively fun, the actor relishing the bone-dry put-downs of a memorably serrated character."

"Baumbach's approach to the challenge of representing marriage and divorce is to treat both as absurdities. His film, though heavy and at times heart-wrenching, leans heavily into comedy -- self-deprecating and humiliating at times, but no less funny."
a magnificent adaptation that honors the film noir classic while giving contemporary audiences a grittier and more nuanced look at William Lindsay Gresham's story.

"From the direction to the script to the production elements to the performances, ""Triple Frontier"" is a first-class ride."
"Director Dexter Fletcher paints Eddie's story in broad, bold strokes, never missing an opportunity to milk a suspenseful dramatic turn or go for the relatively easy laugh -- but it's a style well-suited to this wonderfully ridiculous story."
"It's bold, captivating cinema, with a soundtrack that threatens to never leave your head."
"In Nighy, the witty script leaps to life, in a tour-de-force of darkly downbeat comedic timing..."
"Seymour is intriguing, mainly because it brings together two uniquely talented artists -- Hawke and Bernstein -- and captures them in thought and ocasionally in conversation, sometimes together but more often on their own."
"There's something Steinbeckian about Riley and Charlie, how they dream about gettin' away and finding a bit of land where there's no zombies, maybe gettin' those rabbits..."
The result is an unusually sensitive and intelligent film for young audiences which has a lot to say to older viewers as well...
It will be a hard heart indeed that won't be affected by the way the story is resolved.
"Asking audiences to sympathize with Fox News anchors is quite the hurdle, but this film is the best #MeToo film to date and a must see."
"Auto Focus is not your standard Hollywood bio-pic. Schrader aims to present an unflinching look at one man's downfall, brought about by his lack of self-awareness."
Topics that could make a sailor blush - but lots of laughs.
"This is the Fritz Lang method: pose a question, then answer it, though never in any sort of predictable rhythm."
"Standout performances by Tandy and Freeman, plus strong support from Dan Aykroyd. It's quaint and comfortable."
"Bernadette is a vibrant creative spirit, and Blanchett blithely gives the character her all."
Scary in all the right places&#44; They&#47;Them is ultimately an empowering tale of queer resilience and survival
"Succeeds, in part, because the film is as non-judgmental as the famed sex researcher himself."
Tells (the story) with such atmospheric ballast that shrugging off the plot's persnickety problems is simply a matter of (being) in a shrugging mood.
"Excellent docu on showbiz legend, lots of cursing."
Eternals is messy but there is beauty in its parts if not necessarily the sum.
"By approaching Marshall as just another idealistic young trial lawyer, the film stands on its own as a compelling courtroom drama, complete with surprising revelations ..."

"It won't blow you away, but it remains a well-played and solidly entertaining family film."
"The story is good enough to tell itself, and the filmmakers should have let it."
"Has moments of greatness, but the ending is a slight disappointment."

"For pure camp, intentional or otherwise, this is right up there with The Rocky Horror Picture Show."

"Nossiter makes the evolving wine business into a pointed metaphor for the entire globalized economy, and the opportunities and hazards that come with it."
"Iñárritu turns the film into a high-wire act - live, unpredictable, light as air, yet also fatalistically locked on course. While it's going on, you're glued to the impossibility of what you're seeing. Once it's over, you can't believe what you saw."
"The Hunt for Planet B delivers a captivating viewing experience, showing the sometimes-thin line between science fiction and the true scientific future."
"The Tomorrow War provided all the alien action I wanted, but it also provided a large amount of emotion I wasn't expecting. I went in excited for the film, and it exceeded all my expectations."

Witherspoon abnd Kutcher show terrific chemistry...
An instant horror classic - and quite possibly the scariest film of the decade.
Reminiscent of a whole raft of artistic styles - from the Impressionists to Dali and Picasso - McKean's vision has a truly dreamlike quality.

The story is unoriginal but there's enough action and visual inventiveness to keep fans of the comic book happy.

Does the film rely on a convoluted backstory to make some of its points&#63; Sure&#44; but there&#8217;s still enough going on to make this a suitably fun movie to watch as a slightly above-average streaming original&#46;
...good Old Testament stuff.

"Serra self-consciously removes his film from the assaultive world of media. Its slow pace and dark, lush setting require attention but also a forgetting or abandonment of the world outside."
A welcome introduction to a remarkable man.
Every scene is permeated by a creeping sense of dread.

"The Garden is a film of many moods, alternately peaceful and disturbing, ethereal and familiar, but as with many of Jarman's films, it is also often frustratingly abstract, cryptically symbolic and resolutely self-referential."
"Avoiding the safety of the PC blanket, David O. Russell has crafted a canny, crafty and altogether adorable little misfit of a movie."
"Somehow, among the clichs and familiar story lines, the actors rise above the muck and make a movie that's entertaining to watch."
"Still only 27 years old, Lawrence has every chance of a fifth Academy award nomination and a possible second statuette for this phenomenal and punishing performance."

As warmhearted as the original.

It is not then for anyone looking for a fun night out - but it is a beautifully crafted and acted indictment of how modern economic practice is destroying people.
I admire this. Claire Denis is still directing thoughtful sci-fi.
It's a social and political commentary of a modern day industrial power and the polarisation and inequality prevalent in most developing nations.
Phoenix's performance overwhelms the slight story.
"Lighter and loopier than Bogdanovich's key '70s pics and naughtier and rather more cynical than his woofy What's Up, Doc?, She's Funny That Way is certainly amusing for the first and second acts."
"With its jittery stop-motion animation, exquisitely detailed shots, and outwardly self-aware characters,[it's] the epitome of artifice. It's also as bright and cheery a time as you'll have at the movies this year."
A powerful and atmospheric film that delivers a barrage of images and concepts of both sexual and philosophical natures.

"Marianne & Leonard is told with affection, admiration, and just enough jealousy to make it interesting."
"Comparisons to Boogie Nights...may be inevitable. But Wonderland...is an absorbing and adroit (if not inventive), sobering and smart movie that is worth watching on its own merits."
"Like another Australian musical by a then young director, Gillian Armstrong's Starstruck from 1982, Bran Nue Dae carries the day with energy and self-belief."
City of Men does not have that piercing naturalistic horror and drive of its predecessor. But it stands on its own as a chronicle of enduring friendship in impossibly horrid circumstances.

"It's wonderful stuff from start to finish, and one of the best films I've seen so far this year."
"They call documentary which is actually a propaganda piece, never trying to question Walter's figure but rather falling all over his mysticism, for which I honestly can't blame them either. [Full review in Spanish]"
"When 2014 Godzilla finally fully emerges from the deep like a gloriously meaty centerfold straight out of Bulk Reptile magazine -- a creation that's part performance capture, part computer stuff, thankfully looking nothing like a CG cartoon -- we cheer."
"The film overextends itself a little as twist piles upon twist and in terms of narrative it's not entirely successful, but as a masterclass in microbudget film-making this is well worth a look."
A touching film that perhaps spends a bit too much time digging in the wrong places.
Sexy and wry.
In short&#44; it&apos;s hard to take any of this seriously or care very deeply&#44; but it&apos;s equally hard to deny that some fun -- guilty perhaps -- is had in the process&#46;
"Sokolov made a horrific and amusing tale about contemporary cynicism and romantic hope wrapped around a dark action comedy with clear influences from Ritchie, Tarantino and Park Chan-wook. This movie is a blast. [Full review in Spanish]"

"Durham is a decent enough way to pass away a few hours on a weekend, especially if you love the game, but it ain't gonna change your life."
"A fast-moving, entertaining bit of silliness that's wrapped around a semi-interesting premise -- and a taut performance by Judd."
"It's a film that deserves to be seen, be discussed and win awards."
"Normally I'm not averse to time-shifting in movies, but in this case I found the device unhelpful. Individual scenes are superbly staged and the cast is flawless, making the film essential viewing for lovers of the book."
"Dujardin keeps Georges innocent, almost paternally daffy, as he shuffles toward madness..."
"Look beyond all the staple elements of Disney animations and you'll see two strong, complicated female characters. Those seem hard to come by even in live-action films."

"A cut above the usual rubbish, thanks to a smart script, some gorgeous photography and the chemistry between its two leads"

A savage&#44; savvy and scathingly amusing satire about coveting &#36;1250-a-head meals but letting the workers behind them slice&#44; steam&#44; stir and sweat through upscale kitchen drudgery&#46;
A tribute to how entrenched the Rugrats are in our hearts.

"Offsetting the chilly voyeurism is a viable teen romance and an appealing sense of humor. Though there are occasional lapses in logic, Disturbia is consistently suspenseful and entertainingly disturbing."
"The heartfelt, personal Microbe & Gasoline may be Gondry's best work since the still incredible Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind."
"The truth is, the DC Justice League version of Captain Marvel is a lot of fun, mostly family friendly (except for a monster biting off a guy's head), and just a tad too long to earn an extra 50 cents in yours truly's money-tinged ratings system."
"[Quentin Tarantino has] whacked history over the head and cut away all the boring bits, leaving behind a blood-drenched war epic like no other."
"A challenging and topical consideration of the queer experience, filtered through a racialized 90s lens. Bowyer-Chapman is great and while Spiral doesn't have the supportive gay relationship some viewers want, it's still valuable LGBT representation"

"Theatrical and talky, but it's good talk by great performers."

A very good movie...but I have to be honest about one thing: I don't know that I would actually recommend this film to anyone. An utterly depressing piece of work.

Engaging romantic fable about a young man who fulfils his destiny by falling in love with the woman of his dreams.

When it comes to captivating filmmaking and epic scale even with limited sets&#44; 1948&apos;s Hamlet is an honest masterpiece&#46;

"It's best when addling us with that jet-lagged strangeness of the first few days in a baffling new land. Its shimmering-mirages of strangeness and even its mature, second-chances romance are enough to make this hologram flicker to life."
"It may fizzle in the end, but for 90 solid minutes it scares the hell out of you, taking all the color out of black and white to remind that inside we all bleed red."
CGI shortcomings... slightly blight what is actually a terrific performance from Harrison Ford.

"Alex Kurtzman, in his directorial debut, delivers a compelling and emotional dramedy about a man who discovers he has a sister he knew nothing about."

"Though predictable and often preposterous, this warm and funny wish-fulfilling fantasy is a richly rewarding ride."

The subject&apos;s thoughts count more than the plot&#46;
"A tantalising, sometimes frustrating parable about the menaces that human beings might face from unexpected quarters."

The Cooler is Leaving Las Vegas recast as a fairy tale of sorts.

"The sleeper hit of the year, a rocket out of Sundance trailing Oscar nominations for Hawkes and Hunt and, with luck, writer-director Lewin."
"Even with too much focus on the former character, Frank & Lola, buoyed by Shannon's performance and Ross' acute eye for the seediness of his environments, is a commendable debut."
"Sticklers for plot and character work will find themselves frustrated, but for those simply looking to enjoy tacos and bloodletting with a fun group of maniacs, Birds of Prey scratches that itch and then some."
Touches are just enough to earn The Good Shepherd a third star. But De Niro might want to stick to acting in future.

A lovable masterpiece replete with oddity and imagination.

"Well-crafted, magnificently-acted, and ultimately philosophical."
"Andersson's movie reveals poetic ironies, surreal slapstick and melancholy truths, often all wrapped up together. The gloom gets a bit thick over the 92 minutes, but there are sequences here you will never forget."
"[The similar] 'Omar,' a recent Oscar nominee, is better directed, with assured long takes by an established talent, Hany Abu-Assad ('Paradise Now'). 'Bethlehem' has the better, cleaner script, and the best performance of the two."
"less uniquely designed than just extremely well-crafted, combining a variety of familiar ideas into one cohesive, streamlined and supremely effective effort."
"When the fight scenes, choreographed by Jaa himself, kick in, boy howdy."

All we can do is hope that films such as Hotel Rwanda remind us all -- moviegoer and politician -- of the terrible cost of doing nothing.
"For those willing to risk a close encounter with this maverick, there are undoubtedly rewards to be found in Climax."

One of the great goofy movies -- a film so preposterous I wasn't surprised to discover it was written by a teenage boy.
"Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania takes you on a fun adventure. And, as always, stay back for Easter eggs in the mid and post credit scenes."
Welles' Harry Lime looms over the narrative just as the shadow of World War II looms over the film's post-war Vienna.
"Sadly, this expert and powerfully important film likely will spawn a sequel before all of this is finally over. Look at Totally Under Control as Act I."
"Linklater hasn't just crafted a detached portrait of a unique couple: he's painting a masterful examination of human nature, of that relationship we all want, but too often sadly see slip away."

"Sequences like the one of the outrage, or the subsequent murders, each one more cruel than the other, reveal Lubin as a director more audacious than he seemed to be. [Full Review in Spanish]"
The meat of Kenner's story is the heroics of the Air Force technicians who risked their lives. It adds a personal touch that immensely humanizes a story that could easily get lost in the minutia.

Bud and Lou meet another monster for infrequent laughs.

"A poetic, mesmerizing fusion of fairy tale and cultural commentary from director Jessica Oreck."
"Odom, Ben-Adir, Goree and Hodge are an ensemble of strength and flair. It was a pleasure to witness so many phenoms at work simultaneously. Without hesitation, every man shined just as bright as the next."
"A vivaciously crowd-pleasing space adventure. Of all of Marvel's many Phase I and Phase II projects tackled, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is, to date, the most alive with imagination and wonder."
"[Woody Allen's] most recognizable film, the one that he is most associated with."
"Blue Jasmine is one of Allen's cleverest and most compassionate films, making it also one of his greatest."

This is an incredibly sweet - and occasionally bittersweet - tale about family and love that will move and entertain audiences...
This is one of those movies which make you want to know what happens to the characters later on.

Rat Film somehow manages to combine the rigors of good journalism ... with a formal structure that is about as far from journalism as you can get.
But Klute feels vibrantly alive in a way that betrays its subdued chilliness.
A surprisingly fun&#44; well-written and sweeping adventure that lands most of its gags and sentiment&#44; and even thrillingly pushes the boundaries of animated action&#46;
"A surfeit of screenwriters (eight, including Billy Wilder) and directors (five, including John Huston) lends the whole a chaotic, disjointed air, but there is much fun to be had along the way."
...a decidedly middle-of-the-road Disney effort...
"There's an unflashy clarity to the documentary ""Bill W."" that suits its subject."
"A ripped-from-the-headlines kind of story, it functions with all of the twists and turns required, a bit like a female-centered version of Prisoners."
Try Harder succeeds with flying colors.
"[Susanne] Bier and screenwriter Anders Thomas Jensen continuously push their all too human subjects to the edge, and invite us to witness the fallout."
"Delivers all the trashy, seat-squirming, eye-covering moments your fiercely racing heart craves. Forget about ""guilty pleasures."" Call it a pleasure, and leave it at that."

"It is not art, but it is fun."
"Gloriously shot, finely acted."
"[Perry's] gotten comfortable behind the camera. And without Madea, his obese, smart-mouthed alter-ego auntie, to portray, the man in the dress shows he really can direct."
I don't think we'll ever come closer to understanding and experiencing what ordinary fighting men went through in this global conflict.
The movie has an innocence and charm that grow on you.
"Don't expect a Caravaggio, but if your taste turns to Hallmark, this is a good bet -- a straight-up Nativity story as safe as death and taxes."
A different kind of horror is portrayed in Capturing the Friedmans -- the disintegration of a family after the father secret life is exposed.
It is very well acted and deals with familiar material in a subtle and sensitive fashion.
"[Has moments of] delirious political comedy, and it functions as a thriller, too."
A nice little formula picture.
That is about as 'best of both worlds' as one could ask for.
"A familiar story made fresh thanks to great voice acting and dizzying, dazzling action. Parents won't hate themselves afterward."
"Pellington adeptly rewires the audience's spinal columns with startling images, nearly subliminal cuts and a nerve-jangling feeling of overarching doom."
Its two first acts are a touching and engaging experience. But the third becomes sublime thanks to a magic called Fernanda Montenegro. [Full review in Portuguese]
The fact that The Rookie is a nearly impeccable cinematic experience -- and a wonderful all-ages triumph besides -- is a miracle akin to the story the film portrays.
"A hilarious and touching Netflix original, sculpting a very New York film out of a brilliant ensemble cast."
The acting alone is worth the price of admission.
"There is an atmosphere of slow, creeping dread all throughout the film, like the anticipation of creatures around the next corner."
"Freaky zips by amusingly enough, but its concepts never quite pop like they did in Happy Death Day, nor does it push the envelope enough for a film that references the dark masterpiece that is Heathers so early on."
"Completely sober thought here, but the best concert to attend this week is [one where] the headliner is a filmmaker and automobiles are the tools of the band."
"In its cross-cultural breadth, director Ridley Scott's smart and violent film merits comparison to Steven Soderbergh's ""Traffic,"" but the dialogue delivered by the stellar cast is incomparably McCarthy's."
A tricky little beast that fits in peculiarly well with the recent trend of deconstructive horror films.
"20 times hotter, 200 times smarter than Fifty Shades of Grey."
"At least these superfriends can still crack a joke (I've never been more grateful for Anthony Mackie's light touch) and, for all its seriousness, Civil War sustains a much-needed sense of humor."
"A brilliant, absurd collection of vignettes that, in their own idiosyncratic way, sum up the strange horror of life in the new millennium."
"""The Connection"" isn't all that different from a lot of police procedurals that have come before, but there's something about this particular gritty true-crime story that still fascinates all these years later."
"Daring, delusional and downright devilish, Black Snake Moan soaks in its molasses-driven melodrama with an unctuous confidence and biting creativity."

28 Days is a reminder of why Bullock became a movie star in the first place
An extraordinary portrait of a positive and meaningful father-son relationship that touches the heart.
"If you want to give kids an updated version of this story, this works. It's fine, one of those movies that I understood why they made it, but nothing groundbreaking."
"Carax's film is a cousin to ""Synecdoche"" and a modern response to Rivette's ""Celine and Julie Go Boating."" He even appears to have anticipated Cronenberg's ""Cosmopolis,"" answering the questions set forth...as to where all the limos go at night."
Very much a film of two halves.
"With nods to Kubrick's film, this is no nostalgia trip, but more like a last stand."
A Terrence Malick movie -- only four features in 33 years -- is such a visual splurge that you feel the film and its coffee-table book have arrived in unison.
"It's wild to be saying that everything matters in the fourth movie in a series about a guy whose dog was killed by bad guys, but here we are. It's popcorn entertainment, obviously, but it's popcorn entertainment done just right."
Plaza disappears into her role&#44; resulting in a career-best performance and one of 2022&#8217;s most captivating screen characters&#46; 
Feels more like a gangster movie than a sports drama. [Full review in Spanish]
It's an improbably beautiful film about strangers on a train coming to terms with each other as they make peace with their troubled selves.
An intriguing premise matched with relaxing music to compliment Robert Redford's calm disposition. The movie lacks a thrilling or surprising climax and conclusion.

"Changing locale and genre prove invigorating for Allen, whose London morality tale is inspired by Dostoevsky's seminal novel and mixes elements of his 1989 Crimes & Misdemeanors and such classics as A Place in the Sun and A Room at the Top."
"The film's comedy is loose and generous, and its esprit de corps sneaks up on you with a soft tread."
"It's not Van Sant's most tightly crafted story, but it's a compassionate saga of the Sisyphean task of sobriety."
A warm bath in comfortable platitudes.
"By Pixar's lofty standards, Onward is more Monsters University (also from Scanlon) than Inside Out."

"Even if the plot is full of holes, it's utterly mesmerising."
"A reasonably digestible slice of domestic drama--one that's good-hearted, but that doesn't give you excessive heartburn."
Was Die Hard 4 taken? I know that there are better minds in Hollywood than this that come up with a more appropriate and not so annoying title.
&#8220;Uncharted&#8221; really leans on its star power&#44; especially Holland who plays a very Holland-like character &#8211; charismatic&#44; boyishly charming&#44; a bit daffy&#44; and with an unshakable innocence &#40;even when he tries to talk tough&#41;&#46; 
"In Mark Of An Angel the misdirection is sometimes subtle, sometimes not so, but director Safy Nebbou in the end deserves the benefit of the doubt for just about preserving credibility when the plot goes into a wild reverse skid."
"The anarchic power and novelty of Zola's story survive the transition from tweet to screen, proving that sometimes truth really is stranger than fiction."
Sisters has a patchily funny first act but unleashes pure comedic chaos once the party gets started.
It's all far-fetched in a way that only international spy thrillers -- bless their hearts -- can be.
Sharply scripted character comedy meets shotgun siege thriller.
"Scary, tense, atmospheric, and well acted..."
Once Bill Murray enters the fold&#44; it becomes a mildly more enjoyable film&#44; but the tropes have not aged as well as Murray&#8217;s considerable&#44; understated charm&#46;
"The great achievement in writer-director Jono Oliver's poignant, superb debut, ""Home,"" lies in the balance between the film's empathy for those like Jack who seek independence and its compassion for others who may need care indefinitely."
"It just observes, as young rebel movies have since the dawn of cinema, that life is something that happens while you're busy trying to skate around it."
A raucous and fun follow up.
"Manipulative? Yes. But damn, citywide funerals, a cranked score, and some Baldwin blue steel redemption poses clears away any irksome storytelling dissatisfaction."
"If only all debut films were like this: story, style and substance."
The greatest Steven Spielberg movie since the last great one? Sure.
"Centering on a female protag (well-played by Kathleen Turner) and dealing with a similar universal fantasy of revisiting your past, Coppola's small-town fable is a wonderful companion piece to Back to the Future, which was released a year earlier."
A muddled tale of a corporate high-flying huckster brought low.
Even tweens will enjoy this road trip with Goofy.
"When Hobbs & Shaw digs into the old [Fast & Furious] trick bag, it's as good as the real thing. When it reverts to Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's brand of far-fetched action movies, it's an inferior project -- but not entirely bad."
"In place is a talented cast, an interesting director, an established lead character, and a wealth of plots from the comics ready to be mined for future storylines. Despite Iron Man's problems, it will definitely leave you wanting more."
"Though the film doesn't quite capture the extremes of athletic action, psychology, or sociology, it points at them alluringly."
Minghella fans will be happy.

"It's seriously hampered by its focus on an oddly bloodless love story, but there's enough provocative, thoughtful 2001 style material about the human identity here to salvage the movie."
"This is a crowd-pleaser that will have even the grumpiest of audience members imagine how they could better themselves, if even for a few fleeting moments."
"Perhaps does not plumb the depths of profundity that ""Coraline"" and ""ParaNorman"" did, but it's a funny, great-looking, fast-moving and delightfully likable adventure."
"A taut, wildly engrossing thriller packed with excellent performances, chief among them Jessica Chastain's as a Mossad agent."
A portrait of practical symbiosis in both domestic and emotional terms.
"A slow-burn thriller about isolation and fighting back against a cold, unforgiving world, God's Country grips you the minute it starts and never lets go until the credits roll."
"Armando Iannucci, always a sharp observer of the complex motivations that fuel political behavior, doesn't miss a beat."
"It explodes clichés, keeps you guessing, and takes advantage of the clear trust among the actors to create an unusual and compelling family dynamic."
"Depardieu and Marie Bunel (as Bellamy's wife) have a terrific interplay, but Chabrol's sharp direction can't quite rescue his fuzzy script."
"In the nicest possible way, Saint Frances is a Lifetime TV movie that has a degree in feminist literary theory."
Strictly for unreformed lovers of very French cinema and lovers of the very nostalgic.

There's a bit of a sense of Bourne style action except you can follow it.

"Un film fort intéressant, mais malheureusement incomplet."
"Don't go expecting a zombie film, but if you want to be scared, it's something to see."
"Brad Pitt is a movie star, and he uses every bit of his star DNA to carry Ad Astra. It's the performance of his career."
"As adaptations go, this is a match made in heaven."
"Cole... plays Moore with a clamped-down, concentrated ferocity: the character is no roguish anti-hero, but a frantic knot of sinew, to whom we don't relate so much as just cling onto for dear life."
..I can't stress enough the grace and beauty of Peter Hedges' haunting picture ..
There are so many moments in Year of the Dog where it's nearly impossible to figure out whether to laugh or cry.
"Long-time screenwriter Hossein Amini (Drive) displays a degree of airy, old-fashioned elegance in his first directorial outing."
This bear is amazing&#46; II you want an escape from what&#8217;s going on in the world today&#44; don&#8217;t miss this one because it is a delight&#46; In fact&#44; I&#8217;m still laughing&#46; There were several scenes that put me into convulsions&#46; 
Unforgettable.

"The worst Jason story, but the best nudity of the entire series!"

"An historical opus that is equal parts ballet and biography, though the second component pales in comparison with the first."
This is a thought-provoking thriller that asks interesting questions.
Fanciful? Maybe. Corny? Absolutely. Escapist? Definitely.

A well performed and pretty to look at TV movie of the week.
Utterly conventional polar survival tale rescued by a luminous turn by Mads Mikkelsen.
Engaging.

The stylish conviction of Carnahan and his never-better leads make this familiar yarn worth caring about.
"Fastidious and controlled to a fault, but rewarding nonetheless."
"An effective and shrewdly observed satire, with a handful of standout performances and a gloriously bitter sting in the tail."

There is a lot of clever subversion at play by presenting these characters in a toned-down superhero film.
"Jackson has staged an impressive war movie, and it's no crime to fall slightly short of a masterpiece like Fellowship."
"Race to see Agnes Varda's exquisite 1962 New Wave masterpiece, about an hour and a half in the life of a gorgeous, possibly dying chanteuse."
Put indelicately via double entendre: The Death of Dick Long will make you laugh yourself hoarse.

Tracey Deer uses her background as a documentary filmmaker to good effect in editing together news footage of the protests and fights... ultimately a powerful and compelling film.
Its characters are suffused with a paradoxical kind of fear that can only happen in a dream -- the dread before an immense catastrophe that’s unavoidable because it’s already happened.
"Stunningly photographed by Anna Howard, South Solitary is a very special film, both original and in its own way, quite a daring one."
"Dark Phoenix is full of the grade-A action we've come to demand from these films. But what really sets it off is the dramatic focus on Jean's journey. This keeps things emotionally grounded, however fantastical the FX sequences get. It's quite a feat."
[I]t's a fairly intelligent study of what happens when artistic vision collides with harsh reality.
"Some ingredients are generally signs of a good movie - dark humour, offbeat characters, revenge &#8201;.&#8201;.&#8201;.&#8201;and the actor Mads Mikkelsen. This Danish movie has them all."
"A heartfelt, wise and profound emotional journey. It's just the right antidote to the cloying and pandering Belfast. Woody Norman gives a breakthrough performance."
"Interestingly enough, I like the film more now -- presumably from it percolating in my head -- than I did immediately upon walking out of the theater. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, Sexual Content, etc. - also Available)"
"Its real power lies in the passage of time, the dull ache of loss and the grim satisfaction of revenge, and yearnings of love unrealized. There's an awful lot going on in this film, and all of it is good."
"What Patriot's Day manages to do, and do well, is take a story whose ending we are all familiar with and make it not just suspenseful, but emotionally wrenching."
"Especially well handled are the screen realizations of Dunaway's premonitions. They look like a blurred videotape, as she explains to Jones at one point, a conception which works well on screen."
"The bedeviling and rather lovely thing about Sarnoski's film is that it seems to think it is a thriller, with its brooding self-significance, criminal-underworld ambience, ominous score, and nothing-left-to-lose hero."
"It is an anti-war movie, but not in the usual form we are accustomed to. It is a pro-people movie, the type of which we could use more."
Two generations within one family test boundaries in this intelligent and restrained coming-of-age drama.

"It is jolly, spectacular and sumptuously 3D'd. At times it is actually funny."
"""The Rundown"" ends up feeling like the first mainstream action flick with Black heroes and a stereotypical White sidekick. That alone is worth paying full price."
"It's a character study of what goes through the minds of these people as they try to survive and weigh their options. That is a double edge sword though, as sometimes we wanted a deeper dive into this story."
"""Silence"" feels like a career summation for a filmmaker who has spent his life exploring his faith through his work. Here is a movie about the importance of religion that will move you, regardless of whichever God you worship - or don't."
"In addition to Brolin, others in the superb supporting cast include Emile Hirsch as activist Cleve Jones, Canadian Alison Pill as campaign manager Anne Kronenberg and Franco as a man increasingly uncomfortable at being in the eye of the Milk-spun storm."
"If you happen to be a disaffected, late-20s, polymorphous perverse woman this is the film you've been waiting for."
crams at least three great gags into every 60-second span
"It's vaguely like the fascinating Michael Jackson performance documentary, ""This Is It.''"

Does Bond still have it?
Infinitely fascinating and haunting...
Elle Fanning is full of energy and truly impresses in a film about the lonely life of celebrity.

"The film is certainly a spectacle -- so congratulations, Disney CGI wizards! And there's enough talent involved -- not to mention the good bones of the original story and music -- to make it more than watchable"
"Without a pretentious bone in its body, the movie is 100% spoof."
"It's all a bit too near fetched to be a great movie, it's still fun."

A beguiling splash of pastel colors and prankish comedy from Disney.
Triple Frontier is engaging in parts with well-mounted action. But the characters lack definition and you can't help but think an old timer like Howard Hawks or Sam Fuller might have done it better in half the time.
"Terrifying images, fantastic performances, and a satisfyingly weird ending."
"It's interesting, beautiful and Aisholpan and her dad are so sweet that it makes for lovely viewing."

"It's funny, it's heartfelt, and it just rocks!"

"Polley delivers a rich evocation of the central marriage, with its mixture of by-rote ritual and easy comfort, and makes the wise and unusual decision to portray the cuckold-to-be (Seth Rogen) as decent and good-natured, rather than stiff or cruel."
"The Duchess is a handsome historical film, impeccably mounted, gowned, wigged and feathered."
Every note brings us closer to these characters.

"Hunnam and Malek acquit themselves finely, neither trying to imitate his predecessor."
Carano and Soderbergh have actually created a possible franchise in the character - like a tangible Lara Croft...

Think of Cinemania as a troubling portrait of a cinephilia that borders on psychosis.

There's an avoidance of obvious culture clash comedy... instead Wang deftly details both the guilt of living so far from family and how one's concept of what home really means can get so tangled.
"While there are legitimate criticisms of America's space program, it's hard to argue with a film that defers so humbly to the primary source material."
One thing's for sure -- I'll never watch Iron Man the same way again.
"Sweet Dreams is a little long and overly nostalgic at times, but it's authentic to the last and, rather neatly, it focuses on that third great theme: the matriarch."
"A leisurely paced, gently engrossing crime drama with an exceptionally witty and thought-provoking finale."
"It's rooted in a keen understanding of sports as popular religion, so that Vince's personal victory becomes a communal one, for a nation -- or at least a few blocks of South Philly -- uneasily transitioning into its third century."
"A strange hybrid, which dips into spurty horror and Lynchian parody, with added sexual awakening and shoe fetishism."
Murray gives his most soulful performance since Lost in Translation.. and gives the film its heart and its wicked edge.

"...Coppola's sprawling, harrowing war story is not to be missed."

"The excess in singing in this film is a bit fastidious, but it does give the film a feel more akin to literature than something cinematic. [Full Review in Spanish]"

It's a really iconic amazing movie.
"Galifianakis in particular carries the film with his ""between Two Ferns"" schtick. His tone of voice and delivery suits his character perfectly and reminds me of the first time I saw Shrek. It's the same vibe - namely bloody good."
It is straightforward storytelling of a little know true life suffering at the hands of a system that does not seem to care.

"Although the actors do their level best, there are no surprises offered and no romance/pregnancy/childbirth cliché unused. And yet, I have to admit, the movie was enjoyable."
"Jasmine is a layered, larger-than-life, showstopper who often breaks a poised calm to become an emotional wreck. This is a daunting role for a good actress but Blanchett is great. She navigates between the nimble shimmy and the quivering snaps with ease"

"Matt Reeves has outdone Christopher Nolan in presenting a realistic take on the source material without appearing ashamed of its comic book origins. It is the most like a ""real movie"" any comic book adaptation has felt in ages."
"Night of Kings aesthetic dissonance is discombobulating, but the discombobulation is surprisingly pleasing in its headiness, as Lacôte plays with naturalist filmmaking and spectacle right out of The Lord of the Rings."
"Avoiding sensationalism it unearths the events in Tilikum's life with a journalistic rigour, expanding the story wider to reveal the dangers of keeping whales in captivity."
"Jonze has crafted a sublime movie that's part dark satire, part metaphysical comedy, part bittersweet romance, part brain-bending sci-fi fable."
"De Palma's 1972 thriller is the first of his films to assemble all his signature traits &#8213; Gothic excess, stylistic bravado, a freewheeling approach to plot construction, and a manner of borrowing from Hitchcock that is as much parody as homage."

American Son is one of the few modern takes on the material that never once apologizes for its warrior-in-waiting.

George Clooney is the man.

"A funny look at the subculture of crossword puzzling, a study of both solver and constructor (like Mr. Reagle) that culminates in the annual tournament to determine the best solver in America."
"This may be the most gifted cast yet assembled for a superhero movie, and it's enjoyable to simply watch them play pretend together... [However,] Apocalypse too often feels like a reworking of familiar elements."

"Witty about social pretensions, eloquent about failure & loss, acerbic about family, Allen's light-handed tragedy is a major work. Blanchett is dazzling as the fragile heroine."
"Journey to the Center of the Earth isn't so much an adaptation of the book but a very weak narrative film that uses action sequences from the book to make for cool, 3-D effects."
A dark comedy that snorts big laughs thanks to its gory antics and absurd story &#46;&#46;&#46; a wild fantasy beast action-horror&#44; stripping it down to the facts of the case and embellishing with the most monumental&#44; uproarious elaborations&#46;
"Its complex propagandist subtexts and vision of a reluctantly martial America's 'stumbling' morality still intrigue, just as Bogart's cult reputation among younger viewers still obtains."

Gibson keeps this movie afloat.
"For a movie that lasts longer than two hours and is made up solely of talking, it's impressive that the story never seems to drag."

"Ultimately, though, it's the music that really matters, and Hackford certainly doesn't deny his audience that pleasure."

The top-notch ensemble cast elevates an uneven but stylish adaptation that provides some haunting if improbable twists.
Strong performances from Vera Farmiga and Hugh Dillon keep things from becoming overdramatic.

"A portrait of a delusional, first-rate A-hole."
"While this seriously independent film features the blunt editing (by producer/star Fessenden) and unsophisticated sound of low budget filmmaking, Reichardt's amusing aspiring outlaw movie surprises at every turn..."

Rescue Rangers blows up our expectations of what a Disney reboot can be&#46;

...more entertaining than one might've anticipated...

"Fearsomely entertaining, consistently thought-provoking and occasionally bloody scary."
"Were Donbass a documentary, like much of Loznitsas other work, then I might feel comfortable outright panning it, because then its primary job would be to explain this conflict to me. Instead, the primary job of this film is to lampoon it. "

"""Be yourself and don't care about whatever people think of you,"" 13-year-old Kayla sweetly advises on her YouTube channel. But Kayla is a little girl lost."
An enjoyable movie.

"This is a rare, gentle movie. I don't think we'll see the likes of it again anytime soon."
A defiantly idiosyncratic film that summons the spirits of great Italian directors long past.
Young creates some arresting images of the warped unreality Margaret traverses. She also makes the most out of limited resources.

It's a damning account of self-deluded western power and its failures.
"This is a cautionary tale, about what happens when companies start selling a name instead of the goods and services it’s supposed to represent."
"Heinzerling has a great eye, and his conventional, low-key approach to cinematography in Cutie and the Boxer-no shaky camera, very few tracking shots, and adequate lighting-puts all the emphasis on his subjects."
A complex film that sidesteps every cliché. Paul Verhoeven and Isabelle Huppert are at the top of their game.
"A fantastic, magical performance by Zellweger. When she belts out such Garland favorites as ""Get Happy"", ""For Once in My Life"", ""Come Rain or Come Shine"", ""The Trolley Song"" and ultimately ""Over the Rainbow"", it's pure theatrical joy!"
"John Carpenter's third movie (two years before Halloween), and one of his best."

The Maze Runner is better and more tightly constructed than a simple cash-in. It's a well-paced adventure-thriller with an intoxicating sense of mystery and the chutzpah to take huge leaps with its fictional world.
"Kline gives a beautiful performance, one every bit as moving as Williams' in Dead Poets Society, Robert Donat's in Goodbye, Mr. Chips and Michael Redgrave's in The Browning Version."
"Characters worth knowing, adventure worth seeking, and a delightful shift in tone that will bring a distinctive new flavor to the next phase of the ongoing ""Avengers"" saga."

"As with the last two Star Wars movies, Revenge of the Sith is a visual spectacle, trotting out the best special effects Industrial Light and Magic has to offer."

Will bring back a lot memories for anyone who lived through the space race.

"Yes, the film is grim, but it builds a space where that darkness can serve a purpose."
Markus Imhoof's bee documentary is so stuffed with surreal tableaux it makes your head spin.
"The movie has trouble stitching together disjointed episodes into a coherent narrative. Thanks to a strong voice cast, however, the characters retain their charm throughout."

The film oscllates between the playfully on the nose and the existentially profound with the confidence of a volcano chaser surfing on a river of lava.
Shyamalan's at his best here when leaning into the truly goofy ideas at the heart of the premise.
"It's a tale of two coexisting species, camels and humans, and it's surprisingly fascinating, funny and emotional."
"Scheinfeld's film does the hardest thing for a bio-doc to do: it gets what's great about the artist, and moves you in the same ways their art does."
"Wright's screenplay has a third act problem, where the revealing of the whats-and-hows aren't as interesting being lost in the whys."
"Winchester '73 is simply one of the finest Westerns ever made, in a class with the best of Ford and Hawks."
... the distraction-free bubble focuses the story on the key players and their emotional motivations to achieve maximum impact... (but) the real villain of this story is human fragility.
Adler's screenplay is excellent; it isn't often that a film takes an insightful look at how people can become unraveled.
A formidable actor's showcase.
"Has eccentricity in spades, and a winning performance in lead actress Loren Horsley, yet doesn't quite add up to the sum of its parts."

"As much as I respect Climates, I can sympathize with viewers who will balk at the film's pretensions and glacial pacing."
"Arriving at a bleak time in modern history, the unbridled enthusiasm and playful attitude found within this film gleefully provide the perfect escapism we're likely all craving."
"While not everything here works, this is a poetical and distinctive effort whose commentary ultimately seems to go beyond gender relations to indict humanity's abuse of nature, and suggest an apocalyptic end result to climate change."
"Ultimately, rather than sex, what seems threatening here is impending adulthood in all its dimensions, and in its floaty, insubstantial way, It Follows catches some of the mingled excitement and terror of growing up."
You've Been Trumped follows the progress of Trump's monstrosity ... and it's a horror show to top anything you've ever seen in a Saturday night creature feature.
"While a local filmmaker's perspective may have brought more dimensions, the coverage of events here is impressive and on the mark."
"Every bit as funny as ""Analyze This."""
"I love the straightforward gall of Frozen. Here's a horror film that's confident enough to abandon superficial scares in favor of a far more insidious, intellectual concept"

"Counterbalancing these shortcomings, however, is the comic chemistry of Coogan and Brydon. Numerous sterling moments result from their brainy, breezy pairing."

Why Did I Get Married covers a lot of emotional and cultural ground in its two hours.
Murder Mystery&apos; 2&apos;s  script is ok for the most part&#44; but nothing one wouldn&apos;t expect from a murder mystery&#46;
"An appealing, often hilarious corrective to the conventional pop cultural idealization of the superhero."
This film doesn't take political sides -- and it's all the more heartbreaking because of its restraint.

"Stewart's strained stoicism bounces nicely off of Maadi's winningly garrulous performance, which he has to give almost entirely through a small window in the door of Amir's cell."

It's hard to recapture or exceed that magical feeling of seeing something new and unique as the first Incredibles presented itself to be. Incredibles 2 is such a worthy sequel that it certainly warrants another sequel to become a bigger franchise.
"It's both a lesser Shane Black movie and a lesser Predator movie, but it's still a Shane Black Predator movie."
...heartfelt and poetic...
"Jon Jost's most accessible work imports the lyrical camera of his film essays and the violence inherent in his Western to a poignant, wistful meditation about the discrepancy between art and spiritual decay."

"Deodorized and sanitized but memorably filmed and scored, 'Trishna' is less fully satisfactory in capturing the clutching crush and implication of the subcontinent's megacities."

"""Draft Day"" might be a trick play, but it manages to score."
"No one will ever credit ""Snatched"" with discovering new comic territory. But it earns its share of laughs by covering some well-trod ground."

This is an amazing movie.
Dany Boon is like a mime you don't want to shoot.
"[""Daddy Day Care""] is a straightforward, don't-expect-any-surprises kind of pre-summer entertainment that has a good supporting cast, precocious kids and a premise that lends itself to slapstick comedy."
THEM! was one of the better Fifties science fiction films and one of only a handful that are still fairly effective forty years after it was made due in large part to some very intelligent script choices.

Taxi Driver is a cinematic masterpiece and Scorsese&apos;s best direction of his career&#46;
Redford and Newman provide the real sting.
"It's uplifting and inspiring to see a coach who brings out the best in his girls. Like the documentary Hoop Dreams, this turns out to be a whole lot more than just a movie about basketball."

Remarkably subtle and perceptive straightforward narrative on the rise of French fascism.
"The forceful script is shuddery, steadily building to an astonishing courtroom showdown and a devastating finale, where heartbreak and agony are certain to cloud redemption."

... a beautiful piece of work.
"This is not just the first feature by Haifaa Al Mansour but the first feature to be directed by a woman from Saudi Arabia. That is quite a burden, and yet by some miracle the movie bears it with lightness and grace."
The push and pull of this movie is really between the lead character and the audience. One moment we feel compassionate: he wants to do the right thing. The next moment he's gone down the cover-up rabbit hole and is an irredeemable swine.
"For the most part, Tamhane improbably succeeds in creating a damning courtroom drama that derives much of its power from observing the cogs in the machinery when the machine is switched off."

"Director John Stockwell takes a thin concept and executes it with a certain level of maturity and skill, not to mention a gorgeous visual touch."

A wry humored cop thriller.

"Director David O. Russell's film is dragged down by a confusing tone, but makes up for it with a satisfying look at the way Mangano built her business empire from the ground up."
"It follows a pretty familiar arc, but it hits the required beats with style and a couple of surprisingly well-considered performances."
Becky is a breezy blast and a gnarly genre gem that horrifically turns the plot of Home Alone on its head&#44; with terrific turns from Lulu Wilson and Kevin James&#46;&#10;&#10;

Amusingly silly horror flick with better than average production values

"A superb sports film, based on the best-selling book by David Peace."
"With the same anchor of family and hope in the younger generation, Peninsula is a worthy follow up to Train to Busan, if a little more of what wed expect from a typical zombie action film."

Riz Ahmed's superior acting chops take a dark turn.
A good and enjoyable surprise. [Full review in Spanish]

A perfectly amiable and often funny animation feature aimed largely at children but not childish or pandering in any way.
21 Jump Street on TV is a drama. The movie no way takes itself seriously. That helps. Lots. So does an R-rating where the characters are free to -- uh -- express themselves.

"And while some of the laughs are certainly hilarious, they aren't as plentiful as necessary to make Norbit a consistently funny film."

"Run starts off as a Horror movie, but quite soon it becomes clear that this is an A to Z Thriller flick. Halfway through audiences should probably turn up a notch their suspension of disbelief in order to keep enjoying this one."

"Consider the $4,970,802,499 its quintet of leads has made for Paramount at the box office as long-held escrow on a legendary prank. Robert Downey Jr. is all wild-eyed brilliance, Tom Cruise is re-christened in cool and the film is comic gold."

"""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" is an origin story that gets the late Tom Clancy's signature superspy right."
"""78/52"" delves far deeper into the shower scene analysis than anything I have seen or read before, and that is quite a bit."

The new creative team effectively taps into a quarter century of real-world affinity from fans for some clever meta commentary within the film.

Entertainingly gritty until an ending that seems to go against all that has preceded it.
"Decent, but not consistently strong and -- at least in the case of our screening -- ruined by an obnoxious audience that didn't fully understand what sort of pic they were really seeing. (Full Content Parental Review also available)"
It does come off as a slightly watered-down Pan's Labyrinth - it steps towards the abyss of strangeness but never quite leaps off

"The film doesn't ask to judge King so much as consider a broader portrait, bigger than the muck the FBI peddled, but maybe more complex and dimensional than what our marble statues also suggest. It makes him loom larger."
"Foxx gives one of the year's best performances, and early talk about an Oscar nomination is entirely justified."

Gets at something deeply unsettling about the human condition.
A thrilling character study but only an average action flick.

"This is a gloriously gonzo trip packed with enough odd narrative tangents to fill half a dozen features. While not always successful, this energetic mash-up so genuinely wants to entertain that it's hard not to be won over by its barrage of absurdity."

"""A Fantastic Woman"" is above all the story of a woman who loves, loses her love and fights for the universal human right to experience her loss and mourn for it, so that she will be able to get on with her life."

"A master class in cinematic formalism, from a man with a lifetime of knowledge and experience."
"I LOVED it. An amazing cast of characters led flawlessly by Daniel Craig, Chris Evans and Ana de Armas. The moment I thought I knew what was happening, a twist threw me. One of my year's favorite films."
"It's as creepy as it needs to be, and not even remotely as creepy as its asinine R-rating would indicate, and it's pretty shallow beyond that."
"Wise beyond her years, [Nika, played by Bronislawa Zamachowska] has a curt, verging on antagonistic relationship with her old man, but she's a ray of light in an otherwise grave endeavour."

"A seriously good movie, a challenge to viewers, a rebuke of the way many Americans live their lives."

What can be said about Concussion outside that it's Will Smith's best performance in years? Too bad it's for a movie mostly plays it safe and isn't as thrilling or biting as it aspires to be.
What a treat it is to discover a totally new actor inside one we already loved. And how sad to know we won't see that from him again.

"...starts out well enough, with its quirky directorial touches and even quirkier storyline, but finally becomes just too overwhelming."
"Judy dazzles during its musical numbers... [and] Zellweger throws herself into the title role and transcends playing Garland, never falling into camp, or mimicking the singer. She also captures Garland's mannerisms without making them seem fake."
"As in Field's first film, the characters are drawn with such compassion their follies become our own and their desires seem as vast as the night sky."

Salma Hayek gives the performance of her career in this stealth weapon of a comedy from director Miguel Arteta and screenwriter Mike White.
"Zack Snyder's epic adaptation gives this generation a Superman movie to call its own. Call it ""Superman Begins""."
"The silliest spin-off this side of Elektra, and lots of fun with it."
"Despite its formulaic structure, The Abandoned has a lot going for it. It eschews cheap scares, bloodletting, and gore."
"Moore still hasn't learned some basic rhetorical skills: Will he ever figure out that acknowledging contrary views gives your argument more credibility? But his movie is shocking, poignant and surprisingly entertaining."
"As it is, I admire the brilliance of the majority of this picture to no-end; it's just that pesky literal ending I walked out wanting to declare war on."

"A $130 million epic with much to marvel at and great battle scenes, but it dazzles the senses while barely touching the heart."
Pleasure elicits a taunt and razor-sharp depiction of adult film&apos;s dysfunctional climate&#46; 
"The best Ashley Judd movie Judd has never made... a labyrinthine serial killer thriller that won't win admirers for its intellect, but does have sustenance of mood in spades."
"Hanks is being given an awards season push here, no surprise, though he's bound to be hindered by the fact that he makes it all look so easy."
"It's more like an interesting, in-depth article in The New Yorker than a movie."
"Fegley and his character miss it for me because of an innate selfishness in motivation, plus overall meanness to the story's pranks."
A formulaic yet fun adventure.
"Audiences ready, willing and able to find their inner four-year-old may have a decent time at 'Daddy Day Care,' but others are likely to find Eddie Murphy's latest foray into kidpicdom scarcely more amusing than spending 90 minutes in a pre-K classroom."

"Throughout, Judd Apatow dramatizes the ideal of community with an almost Eastwoodian sense of rapture."
The Forgiven takes a while to grab hold&#44; overcoming its awkward and meandering beginning to settle into being a powerful slow burn of a morality tale&#44; delivered with a memorable performance by one of the great actors of our time&#46;

"Breathtakingly beautiful, truly magical movie."
"Assayas uses the supernatural to explore grief, and Stewart portrays Maureen's heartbreaking loneliness with skill. She completely carries the film."

"For people won't have seen the original ""Oldboy"" or anything remotely like it, this will be a rare studio release that feels shocking and abrasive and perverse and in some way new."
"The film actually improves on Cunningham's novel, thanks to gorgeous cinematography, a deft script by playwright David Hare ... a mournful, melodious but never intrusive score by Philip Glass and a superb cast."

"It's the blurring of boundaries that makes Wildcat more than just an excruciating series of intensifying scenes of torture, disorienting for the audience as well as the characters."
Danny Boyle's purposeful direction and Mark Tildesley's imaginative and resourceful production design keep this fresh and edgy; the images of a wasted London and the details of a paramilitary organization in the countryside are both creepy and persuasive.
"It wasn't the automatic laughter produced by slam-dunk punch lines, but the laughter of recognition, of insight, even sometimes of squirmy discomfort, as the truths hit close to home."
"Of course it's no ""Chinatown,"" but it is satisfyingly moody and atmospheric."
[H]umanity is what Thor has in spades.
"The majority of the gags, as crude as they can be, hit the mark and the interplay between Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly keeps the film from becoming a repetitive bore."

"""You could say that the film is not about anything but, really, it's about everything""."

"What makes Match Point, a coolly deliberate murder mystery from Woody Allen, so startling is that it feels as if the director himself has been done away with."

The story's slow-burn never quite flares into dramatic wildfire.

The core relationship is what makes the movie with this ill-advised title a well-advised choice.
"he visuals are phenomenal, rendered with so much love and passion that each frame is a marvel just to behold."

Untouchably good.

"For this and this alone Mallick should be applauded. His epic of an old world giving up and a new one taking over isn't a masterpiece. But it is different, daring to look at complex historical issues with intelligence and an unwaveringly piercing eye."
"Lynch's elliptical story-telling mode lends the film a hypnotic quality, his measured voiceover complemented by a liberal use of slow-motion."

"Coogler's realistic debut recreates Grant's final day with affection, refusing to cast him as either saint or sinner."
"Trier plays with formal qualities while also baring dark emotions, Triers style, allusive as literature, elusive as lyrical cinema, is virtuosic but intrinsically ragged."

"LaChapelle's powerful street-dance documentary Rize never lets us forget that its subjects are dancing in a war zone. But dance they do, in a kind of controlled frenzy, with music throbbing and limbs whirling and swaying and pulsing to the beat."
"A hugely impressive, distinctive directorial debut and a compellingly humanist window onto a layer of American society that mainstream cinema likes to pretend doesn't exist."
"Swing Time could do with a lot more dancing and a lot less plot; or, if that's too much to ask of the principals, just a lot less plot. However... Even if Swing Time had twice as much plot, it would still be worth seeing."

"Even when the serious stuff falls flat and the racial caricaturing gets a little sticky, the movie still has its moments."
A strong debut with a remarkable performance by Michael Greyeyes that delves on complex themes that are rarely explored on screen. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Milk is an agitprop fantasy about the selflessness of sainthood. If anybody but Penn was playing the saint, we'd probably feel as if we were being sold a bill of goods. Instead, he just about pulls it off. Such is the treachery of talent."
"Plays it pretty safe for the most part, but it does give you a hint of what goes on in the real world."

"""Beowulf"" is an astounding, eye-popping 3-D makeover of the ancient Old English tale. If you have a choice, go see the 3-D version for added depth. ""Beowulf"" is a monstrous treat."

"Showcases Lang potently adapting his style for American audiences, and in the process helping to develop one of America's most indelible contributions to cinema history."
It's a refreshingly taut and intelligently made punch in the arm for a subgenre that so desperately needed it.
That authenticity lends the film both a visceral dread as well as a complicated compassion.
Their dynamic is the main strength of the film; it's just a shame so much reverence has been paid to the novel's many twists and turns. It's paced more like a TV mini-series than a cinematic experience.

"A lowlife billiards drama that lacks the drive and edginess of the classic The Hustler, Poolhall Junkies does get by on its humor, energy and earnest charm."
A film that gives a story about political (and physical) resistance with interesting characters. [Full review in Spanish]
"With an original concept, chilling kills, and stunning performances, The Call is more than worth picking up."

Robin Wright's assured directorial debut plays like a companion piece to Nomadland... and that's no bad thing.

"Best of all, Monster House employs technology that allows for facial expressions and nuances of performance in its animated characters."
"If you like your comedies scripted rather than seemingly improvised or if you thrill to see stories at war with clich, Dope is the feel-good, crowd-pleaser of the summer."
The message one takes away about humanity is not necessarily unexpected&#44; but at least the charm of seeing it through this Equidae perspective keeps the film from wearing out its welcome&#46;

Gorgeous. Like a lost Terrence Mallick movie from the seventies.

"Albeit closer to ballet than drama, this urban nocturne is one of Tsai's most beautiful and naturalistic films -- at least in terms of its rich, humid, almost viscous ambience."
An imaginative family film featuring a tremendously mischievous and likable lead character.
Very stylish Sicilian mafia movie. One part Antonioni and one part Calvin Klein commercial.
"Scenes of cut-out animation are the novel visual approach -- South Park gone non-fiction -- while the vocal panache is supplied by Hicks, blithely shooting down anything that sports or supports the Stars and Stripes and dares to brag about it."

Sosie Bacon gives an emotional and gut-wrenching performance as a woman haunted by an evil entity&#46; Smile has legitimate scares that pack a wallop&#46;
Moore's statement on American paranoia extends back to the colonists. Would there have been a revolution if King George III had imposed a waiting period and trigger locks on muskets?
"""Much Ado About Nothing"" is a delightful and worthy entry into the endless canon of Shakespeare adaptations."
"Its maker, Steven Spielberg, hasn't had so much fun in two decades, since he was schlepping Indiana Jones around the globe in search of a giant misplaced ashtray."
"Harry is, and always was, The Boy Who Lived, and these books and films were about him coming to terms with the enormous obligations of that title, and realising that the burden of life is carried by all."
"Aside from its timeliness, Spielberg's opus on the Freedom of the Press is also an effective narrative on female empowerment anchored by a contemplative performance by living legend Meryl Streep."
It is remarkably good.
The texture of the endeavor is more than enough to sell the attempt. These are images with some level of depth and distinction to them.
Encanto earns its tears.

"This movie attempts to answer the question, what would happen if an angry person suddenly had the power to impose his will on everyone else? The answer is, things would get very bad very fast."
"Once you see this delightful film, that catchy beat will pound away in your chest for days."
"There's nothing particularly sophisticated about the filmmaking in ""Free Trip to Egypt,"" but first-time feature director Ingrid Serban succeeds in telling a simple story in a simple fashion, and it's an effectively moving effort."
"In such able hands, the film transcends its generic restrictions."
"A Thousand and One is rich and complex, the saga of someone battling to build a family and a stable home with no real experience of what that looks like."
"In it's painfully accurate portrayal of characters struggling to make their way in a world that oftentimes seems cruelly unfair and confusing, Snow Angels rings resoundingly true."
"""Girls of the Sun"" has an air of authenticity and grit that's convincing, and Farahani, an Iranian-born actress, makes us care."
"[I]t's an exciting, chilling thing that this documentary does, to decontextualize American power from all the traditional theater."
"I will definitely keep Tim Roth in mind for his first rate character study of a man who is. Well, you will have to see Sundown to find out."
"""The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys"" has flaws, but it also has humor and heart and very talented young actors"
"The film's plainness, and the understated force of van der Groen and Petersen's performances, sharpen its complexity of feeling until all mawkishness is cut away."
"None of ""No Small Matter"" sounds inconsequential because it isn't. Anything less is antiquated thinking and this documentary pushes viewers forward from those misconceptions."

[A] madly flitting butterfly of a film.
"Not just noteworthy as the first picture written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, this excellent neo-noir also stands as an important film in the development of the American independent cinema during the 1980s."
"However shocking the film may have been at the time, it has grown not only as a cult object to be cherished by genre aficionados, but as a work that improves with the addition of contexts that underscore its distinct place in film history. "
"Directed brilliantly, it is a great film whose power might have been missed or ridiculed before 9-11 and whose subject would have been too hard to take right after 9-11."
It contains all the pain and hard work of a real-life relationship. Those who want to work for it will admire Happy Accidents.
"Despite a robust military opening, the film doesn't spark until John Slattery hits screen, from there it blossoms, flashing back, flashing forward, nestling into a nice beat."
"It's easy to claim that Voyagers is Lord of the Flies in space, and it is, which is what makes it good, but it's also a fascinating study of gaslighting and how fear can push the masses to follow a mad man."
John Hughes was born in 1950 but connected deeply with the next generation's cultural brooding.

"This is not a bad film, but certainly it is the film we are left with having not been given a particularly good one."
"Rejoice, Hollywood has made a movie that the Religious Right can like - if you take away the blood and gore. It's nice to know my iPod will work in a post apocalyptic world."
...A highly partisan and energetic documentary
"It's imperfect, but it's enjoyable, and it sure looks good."
"The War Room director R J Cutler is a serious filmmaker, and while some may think fashion is a less than serious subject (Wintour's daughter Bee being one of them, as we find out in one amusing scene), his film is a riveting insight."

Engrossing western that never got the recognition it deserved
"Although the plot coasts along a predictable path, the verbal jokes and sight gags rev things up along the way, making the film enjoyable almost from start to finish."

"Poas and Rodrigues rework Saint Anthony's expedition with a bold concept that seeks to express the essence of an experience, rather than its physical reality."

Spielberg shines with his greatest film in almost twenty years and one of the best films of 2022&#46;
"The fact that Furious 7 is messier than any of the past installments is more than mitigated by its grandeur. ""Dom, cars don't fly! Cars don't fly!"" Brian yells before its biggest stunt. Furious 7 makes you believe they can."
If it works&#44; it&apos;s thanks to a few tense sequences and lots of gore and sadistic violence that separate it from its predecessors&#46; As much as it&apos;s still a fun experience&#44; it feels like the &quot;Scream&quot; saga is running out of juice&#46; Full review in Spanish&#46;
The fact-based story it tells of instinctual heroism in the face of unspeakable horror is powerful enough to overcome its flaws.
"Let's Make Love doesn't come close to Marilyn Monroe's best moments, but those who like corny old romances could certainly do worse."
Animal Kingdom is frequently shocking - not just because it makes Air Supply's 'I'm All Out Of Love' sound cool.
"This movie feels genuine. It loves the characters, but it doesn't let them off the hook necessarily."
You'll feel the sweat dripping off your back. Thrilling beyond belief.
"Still a good movie: taut, tight, spare, invigorating. With a better filmmaker at the helm it could have been a great movie, a modern classic."
an inside perspective of what the big talents on the pedestal of major filmmaking success talk (and bitch) about.
"A story of possession wrapped up in family troubles, from abuse to incest, provides this sequel with a strong story- one of the most underrated horror sequels out there."
"What it does , quite beautifully, is make a case for a common - and borderless - humanity. The strength and love that uphold families is palpable and powerful. Be sure and stay for the credits and have a hanky ready."
"[An] enlightening documentary, which is highly recommended to any cinephile."
"Sing Your Song does three things only a superior bio-doc can do: Tell a stirring life story, place that life in the context of its times, and portray it with the kind of depth and breadth that makes you wonder why it hasn't been told before."
"As a refracted psychological portrait of longed-for motherhood, Nadine offers a revealing glimpse of a subject not often seen on the big screen."
"My favorite movie of the summer is the quiet masterpiece Leave No Trace, directed by Debra Granik."
"Ganz seems to find exactly the right pitch: His Hitler feels real and human, yet there's nothing particularly ingratiating or sentimentalized about him. We never forget who he is."
"The Truffle Hunters isn't really about the food, but far more about those who seek it out."
A WWII found footage horror movie? Yep. And it's good? Yep!
"With a fluent mix of irony and sincerity, Maoz interrogates - gently, but with unwavering insistence - the rituals of a country mired in the moral contradictions of occupation and its own defensive crouch."
It's an intriguing experience.
"The film's effect is so powerful, its timeless themes so beautifully dramatized: War is hell and senseless but inevitable; love is what binds us together and rips us apart; life is a series of accidents-both awful and joyous-waiting to happen."
"The film does shed light an another facet of Nazi history, and it does it with an attention to the complexity of human nature that makes it worthy of its Oscar win."
"Quite possibly [Spielberg's] darkest, coldest, most socially pertinent, subversive, and reactionary film to date."
"A modern-day heist thriller of unusually grim, coiled intensity ..."
"What emerges is less than an in-depth portrait of a man -- we learn little about him, aside from his intelligence, his charisma and his itch to be near power -- than a study of nationhood, history and the psychology of heroism."
...some genuinely hilarious set ups and a nice mixture of farce and other styles of comedy.
Each of the stories in Personal Velocity leaves the viewer wanting even more.
The film has one of those whip-smart screenplays that avoids just about every story-telling pitfall you can imagine spinning out of this premise.
Three Billboards is yet another shining example of McDonagh's distinguished talent as a filmmaker.
"At the very least, petrol-headed punters won't be left fuming by what whizzes past in a blur here."
"Three Times is the kind of film...that requires the viewer to make an investment, both of intellect and of time, to appreciate it."

"It's a film for 2012, for the 99 per cent, for the Occupiers who have been criticised as Starbucks-quaffing smartphone revolutionaries seeking a rainbow connection that could only be called 'kermunism'."
"Bolstered by strong performances and immersive production design, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is an introspective and rewarding film from Tarantino."
"No matter what side you end up taking, you still might be tempted to call your lawyer to go over your will just one more time."
A giddy sugar-rush that slows to reveal its big charms.

A cut above some of the other recent spate of Middle East-set thrillers.
"Love! Assistants! Wordplay! This film has it all-at least by the standards of a fun, disposable romantic comedy, the likes of which Hollywood rarely bothers to release anymore."
It all makes for a lean and spritely if ephemeral Minions fix.
Cooper perfectly captures the chilly terrain of the Hudson Highlands and fills the twisting story with a gothic atmosphere befitting the poet who walks within the pages&#46;
Cartel Land is a brilliantly exposed snapshot of a hugely complicated situation.
"The kind of movie whose dialogue mostly hews to the rhythms of 'like, you know, whatever' but then occasionally throws in a word such as 'puissance.' And, like, it totally works."
The animation throughout is either adorable or breathtaking.
"There's something about the cumulative effect of repeated swearing, accompanied by Thornton and Cox's delivery that turns it into comedy gold."
"It won the Audience Award at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, but don't let that be a source of dissuasion. It's actually a pretty good movie."
"The aesthetic choices and percussive pervasiveness in the score help represent Damien, the man, the podcaster and philophobic. This project is clearly a labour of love and I'm looking forward to Tyler Cole's next production."
Mix of celebrity worship and unflinching biography&#46; Well put together character study with some participants that seem intent on keeping people at arm&#8217;s length&#46; The end result is a comprehensive look that is equal parts interesting and frustrating&#46;&#10;&#10;
"At a dim time for cinema, it can rejuvenate your faith in American movies."
"It's never less than watchable, a bizarre hybrid that somehow works as a whole, even though its various components don't mesh."
"Gimmicky drive-in fare, though nobody can deliver that poem like Price."
It's [in] the intimate moments ... when And Then We Danced is at its best; full of sensuality and endless possibilities.
"Its discussion of passion and obsession, regret and reconciliation is consistently challenging and offers few easy answers."
It makes a thousand points well without any made didactically; it is simultaneously one of the angriest films I've seen this year while also being one of the quietest.
"Innovative illustration, sharp scripting and vibrant vocalising gives this sprightly animated comedy a knack for melting down the frostiest resistance."
"Leonardo DiCaprio is a nuclear bomb as Belfort, the actor basking in the ridiculousness of his surroundings and eclipsing them at every turn."
"Whether the wit fizzes or flops, a Marvel movie will always live or die by its action set-pieces. And in this latest adventure, they are truly spectacular..."
"It's cheeky and confident, maybe one of the director's finest, and its loopy final line is the cryptic cherry on this oddball gâteau."
"This is probably Rob Zombie's best film, though it does often prove that the cinephile writer/director is a gifted tyro. At the same time, as his most formally mannered and tonally tempered film, Zombie's latest also proves his versatility."
"This is an old-school independent film that won't make a zillion bucks or win major awards, but it's refreshingly honest, depicts the kinds of American lives not often seen on-screen and shows us a familiar star in a striking new light."
The whole film sizzles with urban aggression.
"The impression all of these clips in toto is of a life fully lived, of an artist who has seen much in her life and wants to share all she has learned with the rest of the world. But Cameraperson adds up to so much more than just a personal remembrance."
It's not hard to figure out why this movie has triumphed at film festivals.
"Östlund has an exquisite eye for the intimate, nonverbal communication between couples through their posture, gestures, their eyes."
The movie that is staggered by real life tragedy but refuses to be felled; it blurs the line between the world of the characters and the real world in a way that is so effective and affecting that the finale packs a humongous emotional punch.
"It should be essential viewing, particularly in high schools and universities, whence the next generation of policy makers will one day emerge, hopefully more enlightened than we have been."
This is a comedy that recognizes that the wounds inflicted during adolescence run deep and never fully heal.
"It sounds like a depressing little framework, but the actors give it life."
"Don't make your family pay for a death notice in the New York Times. ""Obit"" will inspire you to do something great, which means the paper of record will grant you a free placement."
The movie unfolds in a satisfying slow-burn that makes you feel uneasy until it takes that anxiety and turns it into pure nightmare fuel by making your worst fears real.
"A gorgeously shot, deeply interior portrait of the artist as a young introvert."
"KILL YOUR DARLINGS is really smart, but the movie never feels overly academic. It's too fun and frenzied, beautifully paced."
"Parallels to 9/11, John Ashcroft, the Patriot Act and the rest of the Bush administration's racist thuggery are obvious; the movie creates a stirring tide of activist force."
"No, these things don't all blend together well, but if you can follow Moana's island society's lead and just roll with it, you'll enjoy them one by one."
"In many ways it's a minor film, but it has some insight ..."
A not so bad bromance.
"It's an adulatory recording of the band - that's right, he adores them - but it's much more than that."
"There is something undeniably exhilarating about the film's honest assessment of the never-ending conflict between decency and cruelty that rages in every nation, neighborhood and heart."
"Producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson should be applauded for taking so many bold risks. The gosmacking ending, in fact, may be the biggest in Bond history."
"When a film covers familiar ground, as this coming-of-age story does, it had better offer an original point of view or, at the very least, interesting characters. The Art of Getting By has both, and while it loses its footing now and then, its..."
"Davis' tough, man-of-the-people narration is often annoying, but his words can't diminish the power of his story."
Shin isn't shy about laying on quirky details and oddball splashes to make his third film swing from bizarrely entertaining to dark - though the mystery-solved conclusion feels rushed and is the weakest part of the film.
"Although directed in a pop-smart style that eschews dark, deterministic melodramatics for an unsettlingly sunny tone ... the film also frustrates for having come so close to being something truly challenging."
"Washington directed as well as starred, and it is clear he has no trouble wearing both hats at once"
Burski eloquently conveys the impeccable &#40;but unpredictable&#41; alchemy of the production by underscoring&#44; with frequency&#44; how much of its brilliance was an accidental confluence&#44; how its specific magic was the right combination of people&#44; events&#44; and timing
"With talk about a sequel, it's the perfect time to return to this action-comedy..."
"This story is told with sincerity, heart, and a little bit of magic -- the very same qualities that made the original book a ""you have to read this"" classic for young girls."
The documentary is&#44; like Little Richard himself&#44; colorful&#44; humorous&#44; and wildly entertaining&#46; 
Here is a dark comedy from the great Bong Joon-Ho about class warfare that&#44; depending on your mood&#44; you may find to be a work of genius or too self-indulgent&#46; One thing is certain&#44; you&#8217;ve never seen anything quite like it&#46;

George Romero set a new standard for horror with this low-budget opus.

It's a rhapsody on the mystery of simply being alive.
Instead of relying on flashbacks&#44; Causeway lets you see and hear the trauma and raw emotions of PTSD in Jennifer Lawrence&#8217;s expressiveness&#44; physicality&#44; &amp; interactions with those around her&#46; Lawrence and Brian Tyree Henry&apos;s chemistry is off the charts&#46;
An outrageously gorgeous spectacle of balletic aggression.
"There's less than meets the eye to Joachim Trier's Reprise, but the loose, limber visual style gives the picture a certain panache."
The picture is potent and engaging; even its fictionalized elements ring with the spirit of truth.
"Whether or not there is story plausibility here, there is an emotional integrity to every reaction Maisie has to every development."
"If this is the level of arcane mischief Janiak has in store for 1978 and 1666 soon after, then consider this watcher bewitched."
"""13 Minutes"" is a superbly acted and strikingly evocative work, with careful attention to period detail and its many emotional beats."
It is still a solid - and ultimately entertaining - new spin on the beloved tale.
"...an immersive experience, aided by the absence of narration, and Ed Cortes' eclectic soundtrack is the perfect complement to the individualistic characters featured."
"What Le petit soldat, like all Godard's great films, lacks in traditional narrative or aesthetic form it more than regains in its immediacy of thought."
"But eventually, the world has to start moving again. It always does. That's what the movie is about."
Henry Selick’s first movie since 2009’s Coraline. His fifth stop-motion masterpiece.
"Creed II does not give us anything but another, slightly superior Rocky sequel. It wins on points. Just don't expect a knockout."
"I know what you're thinking, but this is no Limitless (Bradley Cooper). As the cells multiply and Lucy taps into more and more of her brain, it's new thrills-new skills with each passing hour."
"Director Fernando Meirelles tells the story with urgency, and his sharp visual compositions and washed out cinematography ooze gangster life."
"""Kajillionaire"" is a rich piece of storytelling, and it feels like a kajillion bucks."
A heartfelt story with a lovely performance from Scott Chambers.
If a bit long for a cartoon feature -- probably a sign that its makers fell in love with it -- Ratatouille is the eighth and one of the best Pixar features.

"It's largely a Hanks solo show, and the beloved icon is in fine, unfussy form."
"It is not one of those family films that will delight both children and adults alike. However, the kids will find it to be entertaining enough."
"The Amazing Johnathan Documentary is ingeniously constructed, a hilarious thrill ride and the underdog story of the year."
A little more conflict and less beatification would have made for a more insightful film.
"14 Assassins is reliably entertaining, but ultimately it's too traditional to be a classic."
The brown-bag movie of the year: Sneak in a bottle of something bitter and cheap (to match the central characters) and get smashed along with the onscreen relationship.
The quirky script is packed with good lines and off-the-wall moments and the stories are surprisingly moving in places.
"It is a model of dignified, delicate restraint but there are times when it seems to suffocate under the weight of its own sumptuous respectability."
The picture fires on all pistons.
I highly recommend you check this out on the big screen.
"Oh it's fun. An old-fashioned, good-hearted action film with a sense of humor."

"Hersh's intelligent style turns a dialogue-heavy, potentially rote film into an enthralling and moving experience."

What could easily have become its own figurative image of the masculine longing for freedom mines far deeper concerns.
"Mank isn’t about the incredibly tedious question of who wrote Citizen Kane —that’s the hook, but the film’s true interest, to my immense relief, is the incredibly specific story of Upton Sinclair’s failed 1934 California gubernatorial bid."
A sterling supporting cast -- down to the tiniest bit parts -- provides enough astringent intelligence to make the slobbering sentimentality go down with ease.
Enthusiastically acted and sharply written. A big old lovefest in honor of the classic alien visitation movies that we all hold near and dear.
"The Assistant is a must see, not just because it relates to the behaviour of everyone within the workplace, but because it does so without the need to preach."
It's hard to see how anyone wouldn't be absorbed by this fascinating film about a formidable driver and man.
"The Hate U Give features a strong and incredibly moving performance from Amandla Stenberg, who never holds anything back from the audience and never overplays a moment. She's a star in the making."
The film feels equally drawn out despite the bursts of black humour and the emotional depth of Fan's performance.

A seriously quirky piece of work...
An eye-opener that focuses on world-shaking events and makes you feel like you are there.
"Reenactments in documentaries are always a tricky business, but here, they feel necessary. The staged scenes communicate just how visceral mountaineering can be."
"Here, merriment and melancholy go hand in hand, partners in life's dance just as a stiff drink is an accompaniment to life's pleasures. The combination proves as intoxicating as the fancy-pants cocktails the boys whip up together."
"Even though we know the outcome...the campaign progress remains enthralling. Mostly because it's a fascinating snapshot of modern politics in flux...and a hopeful, ultimately moving account of idealism in action."
"The brothers Coen deliver a taut, vastly entertaining dissertation on the imbalance of life."
"Time to Leave blows a fresh, skeptical wind through fairly corny melodramatic territory while keeping faith with the operatic emotions of the genre."
Mild sedative filled with a good run of giggles and the frightening aim of the A-list cast. Nancy Meyers would be wise to keep corralling this type of acting pedigree. It makes her merlot-stained screenplays more palatable than they have any right to be.
A film worth seeing.
"It's a warm, if pallid, romantic comedy that may not do much more to burnish Lopez's reputation, but will certainly not bruise it."
It'll keep the kids entertained for a while and give their parents a chuckle or two along the way.
"It's a worthwhile showcase for Pacino, whose thoughtful portrayal of a washed-up stage actor is both contemplative and darkly comical."
"A stylish, frisky film that sets up the franchise deftly"
"It's a prettified view of love, for sure, but as Sox fans would surely attest, sometimes fairy tale dreams do come true."
"Beast is a strikingly shot, cleverly scripted, unsettling study of troubled psychology in the pressure-cooker claustrophobia of a small island."
"Highly recommended. In a world where the Best Animated Feature Oscar were not basically owned by Disney and Dreamworks, it would be a deserving champion."
"Inside Out's brainy script is matched both by its visual splendor, often invoking the spirit of Miyazaki, and its humanist reach, which extends to both family and (imaginary) friend alike."
"It is not a light movie (as the trailers might suggest), but it's a unique, refreshing one, driven by remarkable performances from Shawkat and Costa."
Remember the name Shohreh Aghdashloo ... she is the soul of this pungent film.
"This is a gorgeous, sweeping entertainment that combines the epic - a rain-whipped ascent through muddy hills is particularly awe-inspiring - with the intimate and the offbeat."
"A feminist chant that's necessary and relevant, a film about female empowerment and their roles in society, the work place and as human beings. [Full review in Spanish]"

Bong Joon Ho dazzles your senses and infects your mind with a delicious concoction of artful entertainment that delivers a poignant cinematic experience. [Full review in Spanish]
"""American Sniper"" is crammed with action, heart-pounding moments and incredible gunshots by Cooper. But Eastwood seems distracted by his need to make a patriotic film more than a desire to show the real ramifications of so much killing."
"Given it could be re-titled 'Microaggressions: The Movie', this is an unsurprisingly upsetting watch at times, but it's made compelling by Vega's dignified, heartfelt performance."
"The drinks and their consumption look mighty glamorous in ""Hey Bartender,"" Douglas Tirola's tidy and ingratiating documentary ode to high-end mixologists."
"In its own, weird way it resonates, even after a story that some will see as silly and an ending that teeters on gimmicky."
"Pledge is (sometimes frustratingly) ambiguous ... I have to give it credit, though. It's a scrappy little thriller that kept me entertained and enthralled the entire time."
A travelogue with teeth.
"""Don't Look Up"" is no ""Dr. Strangelove"" in achieving lasting political satire brilliance, but it does mirror the times in which it was produced."
"Clarke's specialties are anger and violence, and he captures them with a brutal precision that belies the inherent messiness of the action."
Phil is not a challenging film but it is funny and often sweet.

"Set in a place where the American Dream has been dead for so long that no one even thinks to question its loss, the picture features terrific performances from its game cast."
"An appealing comedy with an unabashed streak of melodrama, sharp dialogue, and a superb ensemble cast, anchored by a lead performance by Al Pacino in lovable scamp mode."
... extremely entertaining. [Full review in Spanish]

Downey charms the heck out of the opportunity he's given.

A sinister tapestry of urban unease and feminist fury that turns an ordinary domestic setting into a place of skulking terror. Original and deeply creepy.
Jia Zhangke creates atmospheres and images of great poetic breath that are full of suggestive power and meaning. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Truly romantic movies seem to be a rarer and rarer thing in contemporary cinema and, like Max Ophüls and Jacques Demy before him, Wright is almost peerless in his ability to make an audience swoon and suffer in maximalist splendor."
"Long, lyrical takes - including a startling shot of a floating funeral procession - and Schubert's 'Death And The Maiden' on the soundtrack remind us that forbidden passion will only end in tears. The Danube's rarely seemed so blue."
"In the main, Jaume Collet-Serra is making a character-driven drama about betrayed honor, and the result is a film closer in spirit to the baggage-rich crime novels of Dennis Lehane than dumb multiplex fare."
"It might not be perfect, but this ""Papillon"" definitely has wings."
"A charming, quietly satisfying work, Adam is a commendable film. Sensitively written and directed by Mayer, it's given shape and dimensionality by Dancy, who delivers a tremendous performance that lends the film genuine humanity."
"Thrillingly paced, ravishingly shot and eerily topical, Sicario 2 retains much of its predecessor's dark charm despite its shuffled creative personnel. But a jarringly Hollywood ending dulls its overall impact."

"Mary and The Witch's Flower is a colorful and visually stunning spectacle, a film that packs plenty of detail within its frames."
"In truth, mother! can be about whatever you want it to, making it one of those rare films that you can appreciate without actually having to enjoy any second..."
"It's a fierce performance, not because Rodriguez is a seasoned actress -- she's not -- but because she brings such a magnificent, 'prove-it-to-me' snarl to the role."
The script is elegant and the performances are dignified.
The Hughes Brothers have wisely leapt out of their niche by doing this project -- From Hell is a terrific thriller.
"Will lights and hardware be ready? Can they afford the $200K demanded by headliner Rihanna? The viewer's pulse may rise, too, as Rossi's camera roams frantic hallways, offices and limos."
The infamous butt-chugging scene - will do for audiences what the pie-humping scene in American Pie did for the comedy genre.

"The Do-Over is a throwback to classic Adam Sandler films and, while ridiculous, is still a fun ride."
"While it's all so breezy and zippy and girl-power peppy, it's Keaton who makes Mad Money worth a few bucks."

"The best thing about Millions is the freckled, open-faced seriousness of young Etel's Damian, a kid whose faith in goodness can't be bought."
"Like many a meal, the lives of these characters don't necessarily turn out as planned, but the surprises are what provide the extra flavor and delight."

"As a rugged yet wise exploration of manhood and mortality, All Is Lost gives great Hemingway."
"This is no classic, but director James Wan is a deft conductor who orchestrates the scariest ride of the season from threads of familiarly black melodies."
Jenkins&apos; handling of Chiron&apos;s sexuality is as quietly oblique as everything else in the film&#46;

It's probably the best cartoon that the studio has released since Mulan.
This is a better story than the platitude that it seems to build up to in the final scene. But it was not all the film it could have been if Zemeckis would have realized where his best material lay.

Everything played well for me.
"The film eclipses its conceit, delicately examining both the unique pain that is the loss of intimacy and what makes us fall in love with someone again and again."
"Overall, 'Solo: A Star Wars Story' is a great time at the cinema and really gives Han Solo the spotlight he deserves."
"Morgan's sometimes weird, sometimes whimsical thriller delivers a grown-up blend of film-noir tropes and deadpan humor, for a comedy-drama which starts off lighthearted and then deftly darkens."
"Bergman Island thrums in silence, so it loses steam when, during the second half of the film, reality and fiction begin to explicitly mix. [Full review in Spanish]"
"""On the Beach"" feels more raw and personal than some of Mr. Hong's other work."
Thorough and essential.

Excellent option if you want more than entertainment from... two hours of cinema. [Full review in Spanish]
The Hustle doesn't have a grand message and it doesn't need one. It's two top-notch comedians trying to steal the movie from one another. They both win.
"The film moves on the strength of its aesthetic wonder, almost as if you are watching a feature film made entirely of Tumblr-based gifs and mood boards."
"Skate culture remains in solid hands with filmmaker Stacy Peralta, who fashions his most personal doc on the sport-cum-lifestyle."
"F. Gary Gray's excellent film is as sympathetic as it is bombastic, even when it depicts some of the rough stuff, a lot of the stupid excesses that come with fame, and even some quasi-criminal activities."
"A powerful tale of bravery, compassion and resilience, The Cave is a remarkable film."
A sober and impecable tale. [Full review in Spanish]
[Huppert] manages to make Hansen-Løve's sometimes flat writing come alive at the right moments.
"A fun, energetic caper that tries hard to make you love its characters, but mostly fails to succeed.."
"Though Penn's sympathies lie with McCandless, the director's camera is impassive, and the film's driving intent is to doggedly document rather than celebrate."
Save for two sequences where Sony Pictures' take on the jacket-wearing hopper mirrors Beatrix Potter's ... the film operates between fourth and fifth gears.
The actors' hammy performances only compound the amusement of watching a dynasty propped up by largesse fall to pieces at the very thought of actually having to earn their way in life.
"(Writer-director Patrick) Wang's deliberate, naturalistic style proves to be both a strength and a weakness. In the final analysis, the overall timeliness of Wang's storyline as well as the film's lack of sentimentality is of considerable value."
"Alas, the out-on-the-town portion of the movie is less engaging, although if you're a Smiths fan you can happily rock out to the greatest-hits soundtrack, which has everything from the title track to Panic, Girl Afraid and How Soon Is Now."
The performances are great from top-to-bottom...this was a movie that probably should have been on the big screen.
"It's nervy stuff for any filmmaker but especially one who loves to imbue a sense of melancholy amid the hopeless. For Nightmare Alley, there is no sweet, only bitter."
"A confidently handled, promisingly edgy feature debut...Winter Brothers dribbles into obfuscation its closing stages but has already confirmed Palmason and company as names to watch."
Ozon knows his female characters like few others. [Full review in Spanish]
...a high concept premise that's employed to somewhat bloated yet predominantly entertaining effect by Badham...
As much a loving homage to the horror genre as it is a lament for a civilization on the brink.
"Amin's story is so thick with drama, terror and bloodshed, why create a fictional character to serve as a vantage point?"
"It's a gorgeous, thoughtful, well-acted, morally complex and adult-skewing character study from a major studio. Warts and all, it's exactly what we say Hollywood never bothers to make."
"Joseph Hader breathes life into his role with a raw, understated performance that somewhat compensates for the screenplay's lack of emotional depth."
"It rollicks along with a lot of help from the songs, which lift the spirits as well as lending pace to the plot but the insistence of the message-making means Cinderella and her Prince fall short of making magic together."

English film that powerfully and practically speaks to the communal dimension of our responsibility to the natural world.
"Eggers has solidified his legacy as a wonderful director and there are no doubts, he will be making movies, possibly even Oscar worthy ones, for many years to come."
"Life Animated, is a heart-warming, honest and thoughtful film about how a family made magic out of adversity."
Thinking back on &quot;Suspiria&quot; yields sense memories&#44; electronic haunted-house sounds&#44; stylish and outr&#233; brutality&#46; It&apos;s possible to forget Harper is even in it&#44; but it&apos;s not possible to forget the opening salvo of operatic violence&#46;
Here you get a rare glimpse of exactly what the interface between a West Bank resident and the Israeli army has been like ...
"The audiotapes are the treasures: They resurrect Wilson as a warm, amicable presence. It's almost if Wilson had -- dare we say it? -- invited us pull up a stool to join him for conversation and a (non-alcoholic) drink at a friendly bar."
"The Mojo Manifesto: The Life and Times of Mojo Nixon is a riot, especially for fans, or a good primer for those who don’t know him."

"Shawshank aside, this is the best non-horror Stephen King adaptation of the bunch."
It has to be admitted that Scott and his team have retained their ability to make the flesh crawl.
"Very much a character-driven piece, which not only makes the laughs bigger but also earns a deeper involvement."

"Kapadia refuses to glamorize Winehouse's addiction as a casualty of rock 'n' roll or just another entry into the ""27 Club."""
"The most ambitious and impressive Coen film in at least a decade, featuring the flat, sun-blasted landscapes of west Texas and an eerily memorable performance by Javier Bardem."
"There's something amiably Quixotic about this recklessly dangerous flight, something innocent, and the vistas of the 19th-century London landscape are really quite something."
"The movie feels uncompromised, genuinely transgressive at times, and smart in the ways it entertains."
Fresh transitions from simmering romance to boiling carnage and in doing so becomes a deliciously moreish movie morsel.
"It's possible to be genuinely moved by that reckoning - and to admire the obvious intelligence and care that have been brought to bear on ""Stillwater"" - without fully buying the trail of contrivances and compromises it leaves in its wake."
"Structurally and tonally, the third act is a challenge. But the longer I linger on it, the more I admire the risk taken by McCarthy."
"There's a heightened edge to I, Daniel Blake, an embittered streak of comedy that keeps the otherwise miserable plot from weighing too heavily."
Even the most televisionally overstimulated will likely enjoy this boy-and-his-dog movie -- which also happens to be a girl-and-her-cat movie too.
"When the visit ends, one is grateful simply to have been in their esteemed company."
"More than a decade after The Blair Witch project turned the mock-doc format into a horror cliche, this low-tech horror show uses it to chilling effect in this story of cynicism vs. things that go bump in the night."
"Opening in domestic contentment, moving through personal anguish and ending with a cosmic lament, it's a simple, wrenching story of love and loss that pries open a window onto eternity."
"It's a fascinating news story, but the film's additional, if entertaining speculations remain just that."

Ruzowitzky depicts the care and attention to detail that went into the operation.

"Has the slow-pulsing vertigo of a psychological thriller & the twists of an elaborate melodrama, but to reduce it to these labels is glib. Caustic & funny but never misanthropic. A study of the ways people actually live, rather than how we assume they do."
Law's committed performance is the biggest selling point for the inconsistent movie.
The imagery on display is amazing&#44; and its power frequently overtakes the screenplay&#46;

A hugely successful experiment to see if a movie can captivate an audience with a conversation between two people in real time.
This exploration of tumultuous romance is rare in its scope and frankness.
The genuine charm of the cast will continue to disarm those who can't entirely erase thoughts of guillotines and tumbrils.

Craggy. But worth it for the views.

"Not bad adventure, nothing special, but not bad"
"Just as the plot threatens to run out of gas, Lin rescues the film with a spate of vastly ridiculous and therefore enjoyable set-pieces, most of which involve means of conveyance designed to make the cars look puny."
The Broken Circle Breakdown is a very American romance. It is also a very European tragedy.
It is the thematically-rich storytelling that makes &apos;Halloween Ends&apos; truly special&#46; Making a film  that is supposed to end an iconic horror-thriller franchise character-driven&#63; It doesn&apos;t get ballsier than that&#46;
This lively animated adventure keeps us entertained even if the story and characters aren't particularly well-developed

"There's plenty to laugh at in Stern and Sundberg's picture, both in the footage of Rivers on stage and in front of the filmmakers' camera."
Lonsdale carries this love story&#44; even if it spends a little too much time focused on its outlandish premise &amp; not enough time on the actual romance&#46;
"Hustlers is brash, often crude and unabashedly chaotic, but it is its ""buddy movie"" sensibility which ultimately wins the day. A robustly made, beautifully acted and decidedly engaging story about some unlikely heroines."
An almost unimaginably thrilling experience.
"A bespectacled, bow-tie wearing beagle with a genius IQ and a penchant for terrible puns... Erudite, pedantic, prissily formal, he sounds a lot like Niles from Frasier but he'd make a great Dog-tor Who."
Writer/director Jason Orley's debut is funny ... but it's also surprisingly insightful about why these characters do the things they do and let it get so out of control...
"At the end of the day, while unnecessary, ""Army of Thieves"" thrives because Schweighöfer's go-for-broke attitude pushes this overlong, low-stakes, heist caper into the realm of enjoyability."
"Although Hall's impressive debut is about very specific people in a particular place and time, the questions it raises and the experiences it dramatizes are broader, more universal."
An absolutely heartbreaking tearjerker...
"...a brilliant, precise cast. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Overall, Arctic Tale's one true message is clear: Stop global warming before it's too late."
The exploration is deep&#44; very deep&#44; so much so that one could easily imagine a much darker and edgier film could have been the result&#46; As it is&#44; &quot;Seriously Red&quot; sneaks up on you&#46;
"Those who were furious at Tyson will be made even angrier by Toback's film, for here is a fresh provocation-an attempt to restore to Tyson the human dimensions that have been taken from him (by himself, of course, as well as by others)."
"An existing affection for Waititi's specific brand of humour will help audiences embrace this film, but the bold optimism of his worldview comes through in any context."
"A fascinating look at the intersection of commerce, celebrity, and controversy."
[A] joyfully oddball work about friends who aren't your friends and the price one young couple must pay for always being happy.

The story sets out to be that whimsical escapist romance with a European setting where love and heartbreak span decades in that mystery format. Director Augustine Frizzell pulls out all the stops at making this film the unabashed epic romance that it is.
"The feel-good story and sing-along production numbers are likely to please the movie's target audience of tween girls, but there's not a whole lot in ""Annie"" to win their parents over."

The film...is more interested in the waywardness of almost everyone's longings and in their failures of self-preservation than it is about Lulu's particular immorality or recklessness.

"...has a spicy, sweaty, sun-baked sense of place and an air of magical realism, both of which enhance its central themes of love, passion, perception and faith."
A bold exploration of some of the challenges faced by investigative journalists in an age of dirty politics.
Disney should celebrate the day they first teamed up with Jon Favreau as a national holiday.
Coda isn't merely a feel-good movie; it's the pinnacle of a new wave of post-Donald Trump cinema that can only be described as 'happycore'.
"On the plus side: the battle scenes, brilliantly filmed with a hand-held camera; a remarkable portrayal of a sadistic English officer by... Donald Sutherland; and clever art direction... On the debit side is Al Pacino's ludicrous performance."

"It likely won't receive all the Oscar hoopla that many are expecting, [but] American Gangster is one of the first films of the year to actually deserve the recognition."
The veteran director has gifted us with yet another tantalising&#44; transcendent exploration of the consequences of our endless attempts to modify our sacks of flesh in order to feel something&#46;

Yonebayashi's unwavering faith in the clear values and direct narrative structures of a good storybook energize his rousing entertainment with sweep and drive.

"By the time the film gets where it's going, viewers may identify more than they expect with those who've been controlled by others with hidden agendas."
"Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris movingly weaves a tale about finding an outer beauty that reflects the purity of heart within. It’s as pleasant as you want a movie like this to be, yet it does so without simplification that patronizes the audience."
"Happily is a dark comedy with an all-star cast of characters, building tension in a wound up house of deception, boiling over into a wild and weird getaway."
What makes Depp so incredible as an on screen presence is his generosity. He hardly commands the screen as much as he shares it with his co-stars.
There&#8217;s nothing didactic about &#8216;T&#225;r&#44;&#8217; nor any simple moral you can hashtag or put on a bumper sticker&#46; The film is complicated&#46; Difficult&#46; Much like its protagonist&#46;
"Detachment is a powerful, incisive and emotionally stirring film that provides keen insight into an over-saturated topic."
"Django is infectiously rousing and exuberantly subversive. Say what you will about his insensitivities, nothing in Tarantino's approach is condescending or pretentious."
I've been sold on the rich possibilities of these new movies. I'm letting the Force in this time.
A compelling report.

Barnard poetically suggests that the absence of good parenting turns childhood into a purgatory that can only end with adulthood's cruel arrival.

...a surprisingly touching drama about finding that balance between our past and present selves.
A medley of familiar Christmas classics...with a distinct Muppet spin.
Duplicity is a light and airy affair that has far too much fun with zingy one-liners to be concerned with the rather relevant dirty laundry that's being aired out.

"You Should Pay Nine Bucks for This: If you've been feeling sluggish and grumpy lately. I recommend daily viewings. If it doesn't make you wildly happy, then I want to hear from you."

&#8220;Goodnight Mommy&#8221; is a roll of the dice&#46; If the premise intrigues you&#44; you&#8217;re taking your chances&#46; Nicely shot and paced&#44; it will hold your interest&#44; but it is the ending that will determine whether you consider it time well spent&#46;

Steven Spielberg's best movie in at least a decade.
Explores with creative and comic energy the difficulties of the sibling bond and the mixed feelings we often have for those who share our history.

An essential documentary that helps explain today's politics (and perhaps tomorrow's) around the world. [Full Review in Spanish]
"This imbalance in the screenplay keeps Far From Men from its chance at greatness. Nevertheless, its strong stance of taking the side of humanity, even in the face of a civil war in which sides are expected to be taken, deserves respect and applause."
This is the kind of intimate little indie that I wish we got more of. 
"The thrilling beauty of this reading of Beowulf is that it makes [the characters] feel modern... These people live in the real world, not in a fable and not in a history book."

"Haunting and ominous, written, directed and acted nearly to perfection."
"Deftly directed by Stephen Frears, the film is funnier than you might expect. The opening sequence alone is a mini masterpiece of pacing. And Dench gets to show enormous range."
"Casino Royale is the riskiest of Bonds, and it immediately establishes itself among the series' top tier because almost every gambit pays off."
"Like 'The Lord of the Rings,' 'Spider-Man' is grandly, emotionally affecting in a way that it had started to seem that Hollywood blockbusters never would be again."
"Demonstrates how homage can provide the undercurrent for a films visual and narrative language, yet go beyond simplistic checkboxing of references...Plays like a cold winter storm with occasional gusts punctuating the biting, incessant frigidity."

a complex plot that manages to balance character writing with slam-bang action sequences

Impressive scary indie horror pic.
A minor anthology delight from Max Ophüls
"German made horror/slasher pic that rocks, as it makes the viewer uncomfortable."

"What remains is a fascinating, Kafkaesque portrayal of justice (or lack thereof) in modern China, but it's no knee-slapper and, at more than two hours, it's long for a comedy."
An eerie and intimate psychological thriller with Hitchcockian tones harkening back to the Shyamalan's early 2000s run that put him on the filmmaking map.
"A round of hide and seek with some blue bloods gets, well, bloody in the very funny horror-satire Ready or Not."

"Funny, sad and bittersweet - one of Noah Baumbach's finest."
Writer/director Thomas Robert Lee's The Curse of Audrey Earnshaw ... doesn't do much new but does present its story with a strong command of mood.

It&#8217;s been years &#8212; maybe as far back as &#8220;All the President&#8217;s Men&#8221; in 1976 &#8212; that a movie has captured the craft and the passion of journalism as precisely and as smartly as director Maria Schrader&#8217;s &#8220;She Said&#46;&#8221;
"Love and Honor is a welcome affirmation of Yamada's determination to maintain his historic workload, even while in his 70s."

"I could not possibly care less about football, and I fell hopelessly in love with this movie, and with the can-do amateur team it introduces us to."
"While it lacks outright Cronenbergian pleasures, ""Maps to the Stars"" repeatedly connects as a dark comedy and insidious display of rancid human behavior."

A striking phantasm of affection&#44; regrets&#44; and remembered accounts that might be factually inaccurate but emotionally unfeigned&#46;
"Disney's multi-Oscar nominated musical is not as good as Mary Poppins to which it's often compared, but Angela Lansbury is well-cast and most of the visual effects, which won the Oscar, are impressive."
"Green concocts a series of deliciously telling moments of behavior or lines of dialogue, and a game cast and crew are equal to the offbeat content."
"Eastwood takes the film in some interesting directions by sticking to documented facts, zeroing in on Richard's reluctant decision to fight back against the system he loves..."
"Each time the script wobbled into cliché, I cringed. The actresses are too talented to flail on hallucinogens. But they launch into idiocy with so much energy that even the dumbest scenes lift-off."
"The outrage of actor-turned- writer-director Peter Mullan is palpable, and every frame of this shocking and occasionally exploitative film is designed to ensure that this reaction is contagious."
"Williams delivers a solid, twinkle-free (though closed-off) performance, but the film as a whole can't decide what it wants to be."
A passable yet underwhelming sequel...
"It will make you feel wonderful, and if you're like me, whose emotional barometer responds in the positive with tears, take plenty of tissues."

A complex film about the minefield of loyalty and betrayal.

"Scandi-noir takes a supernatural turn in Joachim Trier's creepy, erotic thriller."

"Despite the chaos of the mixed genres and the strange narrative, The Five Devils still has standout moments. Dramé is exquisite as the precocious Vicky."
A perplexing but all-too-human psychological drama ...
"An absorbing, rewatchable drama that quietly told loud truths, and wore its anger remarkably lightly."
"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari illustrates something more eternal: about great manipulators, and the underlying anxiety that either society has gone mad, or we have."
"Jennifer Lopez is outstanding as Selena, lending ability and grace to the stage numbers, in particular, but throughout the film, in general."
[Hugh] Grant is a hoot throughout as he channels vintage Michael Caine for equal parts menace and camp.
"""The Beguiled"" probably could've benefited from a little more energy in its telling. Still, Coppola offers some gorgeous images of the past made present."
... an enjoyably frothy 'date movie'...
Khaou carefully constructs each scene for maximum impact-intentional repetition expressing the experience's ever-changing evolution.

"'Don't Come Knocking' is about traversing landscapes of memory. Even as the American Dream is fading in the open, once empty, surreal western landscapes now strewn with the detritus of an entirely disposable material society, so too the western-movie hero"
It could have been called What a Girl Actually Has.
As a snapshot of an age and life stage&#44; Trier helms a film that&apos;s canny and incisive&#44; also perfects the sensation of constantly zipping onwards even when it seems as if you&apos;re stuck&#44; and knows how to find both joy and darkness in tandem&#46;
"Sang-ho can't quite resist a last-minute lurch towards sentimentality, but for the most part he keeps this moveable feast for the undead on track with relentless and bloody carnage."
"With the extraordinary Hoffman doing double duty as director, this film -- with its incisive look at the fragile women and benumbed men of NYC's lost army of loners -- is one of the best of 2010."
"The Rock and Emily Blunt knock themselves out to entertain in this dopey, derivative, theme-park ride of a movie. But, hey, the kids will love it and like the Metallica thrasher that bizarrely shows up on the soundtrack, ""nothing else matters."""
A meditative Western that focuses on the spiritual transformation of a female settler into a leader as she journeys West in a covered wagon caravan.
"This, Albert's voice, is what separates this piece from reports from other publications - those minute details spoken with such a nostalgic, heartfelt cadence, being revisited in the present, never spoken on screen beforehand."
"Gringo gets a lot of mileage out of its energy, its ability to use cruelty as a motivational tool rather than just as a way of belittling others, and its copious amounts of creative violence."
"Thriller about brothers has realistic violence, language."
"""The Signal"" is a sci-work of thoughtful hints and feints, but the movie's big reveal raises as many questions as it answers."
"What Days offers is an incredibly realistic, near-documentarian sketch of two ordinary lives that informs you of the characters' circumstances and emotional state without telling you anything."
"We are definitely on familiar, well-travelled ground, which explains why the visually impressive Reminiscence is good but falls well short of great."
"At the movie's climax, they [the actors] bring new life to liberte, egalite and, of course, fraternite."
"A sweet, quickly told story and very good writing makes it very easy to love I Love You, Man. Another plus: it's not produced, written or directed by Judd Apatow."
"It's best to approach Find Me Guilty as a showcase for Diesel, who is finally beginning to prove he's more than the next-generation Van Damme."
Count 'Camp' as the rarity it is: a modern movie that's funny and sweet.
"...the career of consumer advocate Ralph Nader, in an adoring hagiography..."

A pleasantly nonsensical roller-coaster ride.
Wonderful book adaptation with strong female character.
The beauty of this adaptation of Belgian author and illustrator Gabrielle Vincent's characters is its sheer simplicity and sincerity.

"Katie Dickie gives an astonishing performance as Jackie, displaying a cold, brittle exterior that occasionally cracks to reveal both pain and passion in equal measure."

"Tangerine unostentatiously celebrates fluidity, community, support and is generally quite hearteningly right-on..."
"It's a combination of nostalgia, good vibes and even a bit of ""you can't reheat a soufflé,"" but if you loved the first one you'll connect to this sequel. Wesley Snipes is rad!"
"Sure, the closer you get the more it has a cubic-zirconia feel, costume jewelry instead of the real thing, but, hey, it's a plenty breezy diversion here in the latter days of this seemingly unending winter."
Anderson skillfully dissects the idea of the New York intellectual bourgeoisie and examines the growing void between families.
"Clearly, del Toro has a deep affection for both his characters and the world of gods and fairy-tale monsters, and it translates into a rich, sophisticated sequel that actually improves on the original."
"Blow the Man Down is a strong showcase for older female character actors. In most movies, performers like Squibb, Martindale and O'Toole would maybe get to steal a few scenes. Here, they're the main attraction."
Spike Lee using his white voice - for subversive purposes.
Features a great performance from the Danish actor Jesper Christensen.
Need escape? Logan Lucky is for you.
"Battle scenes are infused with a propulsive sense of urgency, as Bradley (a vet stunt coordinator and second unit director) often achieves an effective semi-documentary look."
A tender and exquisite animation about one man and his dog which gets as close to what it is to love dogs as I've ever encountered.
Erguven's assured direction seals the deal. There's a mythical quality to this tale of burgeoning female sexuality that transcends the more hackneyed elements of the plot and marks her out as a director to watch.
A truly F'ed up thriller and aesthetic experience.
"This film bites with all of its teeth. It's an exercise in a certain level of brutality that we seem to reserve for those we know the best -- our family, our friends, our neighbors."
It's wicked and cynical and I suspect Hollywood will want to remake it but will strip out its acidic nature.
"Exquisite on every level, Dreamchild is a film to cherish."
"It feels like one of those live-action Disney features that were so prevalent during the 1970s -- one could easily picture Jodie Foster as the prepubescent heroine, Dean Jones as her bumbling uncle, and Don Knotts as the supremely self-satisfied villain."
"Among the more unique, one-of-a-kind movies of the year. And I'd love to see a where-are-they-now sequel in a few years."
Godzilla Vs Kong delivers action and spectacle by the bucket load and will leave anyone who wants to see a giant ape hit a giant lizard in the face with an axe very satisfied&#46;
"The movie's ending will not satisfy everyone, but it does avoid typical Hollywood conventions. Whether it is the correct finale is something you will have to search your own heart to answer."

A United Kingdom never sacrifices its narrative in favor of making a statement and it rarely resorts to sermonizing.

"There are worse ways to spend two hours than in the company of ""Snow White and the Huntsman."""
"As a record of the Al Franken you already know and love, Hegedus and Doob's rather slapdash movie is fun."

"[Alexander] Payne is aided greatly by [George] Clooney, whose befuddled expressions should be engraved in the cement at Grauman's Chinese."
"At its heart, Shazam is a movie about making your own family, bridging the gap differences seem to make, and having a good laugh while you do."
The tone of the movie is cheerily macabre.
"A cross-generational character comedy whose biggest problem is its characters, Noah Baumbach's While We're Young is sharply observed but frustratingly slight."
1960s-set family drama tackles weighty issues.
Oakley has crafted a sad and shrewd film about the loneliness of hiding your true self and the inherent evils of compulsory heterosexuality&#44; especially under the guise of &#8220;protecting children&#46;&#8221;

An intriguing tale that twists and turns in some unexpected ways.
"Director, Scott Hicks has created a really lovely film. It's fortunate that the star power of Clive Owen gives the film a core dynamism."
"... The film’s writer-director, Colm Bairéad, shows how a well-judged movie can come near to corniness but still be deeply poignant. "
"For casual race fans, Racing Dreams is a real eye-opener. And it's a darned entertaining way to get a handle on a sport that can seem like a bunch of cars doing circles for a crowd that seems most interested in seeing that next epic wreck."
"It's essentially a soundtrack -- and a good one at that, led by Timberlake and Anna Kendrick, with contributions from Gwen Stefani -- in search of a story."
"Though not without striking qualities by itself, it serves best as a poignant stepping stone to the auteur's later, more famous projects."
"A twisty, chilly vision of haute-yuppie parenting as unrelenting nightmare, an ingenious reworking of the demon-seed genre in which the evil child is not the real villain."
"A goofball riff on the pirate-movie genre, this sequel is as insubstantial as popcorn -- and as delicious."
"Cloying smart, gleefully mischievous and resplendently, stupendously gross."
"Not Okay is like many “internet movies” before it – approaching uncanny valley, somewhat obvious, just a little off — but this unsettling darkness makes it a solid entry into the canon of just-okay social media films."
I'll Sleep When I'm Dead may take its place with Get Carter as a classic British gangster film.
It's a very sly piece of filmmaking.
"This is the arid equivalent of Werner Herzog's Aguirre, Wrath of God. Reichardt offers the minimum of genre conventions and none of the genre's satisfactions or resolutions."
"Any frustration is neutralized whenever Krieps is onscreen. The actress plays Chris as beguilingly childlike, her feelings and impulses... right at the surface, intensifying and subsiding, arpeggio-like."
"Enraging, and eye-opening, the beginning of the antidote for how black women's lives get erased in America. Tells a story that we should recognize as epic."
The film can jar when oscillating between the CG-realised worlds and sequences with actors playing non-Na&#8217;vi characters&#44; but for the most part The Way of Water is a sumptuous visual tapestry&#46;

"Transcendent and absorbing, depicting our place in the universe with ferocious honesty and unflinching strength."
"The Sacrament is worth a watch for fans of the director and cast, but its lack of purpose or anything to say limits its staying power dramatically."
"Wong made Chungking in just 23 days, and the film's mad-dash energy is nicely reflected in his quartet of stars. Wong, himself a star of cinema's future, has already shown that he possesses a uniquely '90s voice, eye and spirit."
The best horror film since The Blair Witch Project.

intelligent and very well-acted
"An inspiring, fun documentary."
Deep Impact hits the bull's eye for sci-fi action thrills and the sheer power of an engrossing adventure that marries plausible ideas with a jump into the beyond.
"Though it may seem Biller is mountain an assault on delightfully garish exploitation fare - with overemphatic titles like ""Vixen!"", ""Score!"" and ""The Lickerish Quartet"" - that's not quite what she's doing."
"Suffers the same problems that most sitcom to movie adaptations suffer from, but fans of the series should find lots to love."
"The satire's still there, albeit not as angry and more obvious, and the targets have shifted. It may not have the original's subversive nutso attitude but there's a couple of crazy surprises up its sleeve and a surprisingly engaging story."
A feat of photography.
"Corseted courtesies and the candlelit rooms with their flickering pools of light never overwhelm the story's contemporary resonance. The clash of male assumption and jealousy, and female wiles and independence, has no shortage of present-day parallels."
"A thoroughly enjoyable film with a lot to like about it, even if you're not a fan of 'The Boss.'"
"Be it Panda-Rific, Perfectly Panda or Panda-monium, one thing is for certain when we're talking about Kung Fu Panda 3 - It's the Best.Panda.Ever."
"Efficient, well-crafted and solid to a fault, The Finest Hours might have been made 30 or 70 years ago, and starred Gary Cooper or James Stewart -- it's profoundly old-fashioned but pretty enjoyable for all that."
"This is meaty, dramatic stuff - see this movie with your teenagers and watch their jaws hit the floor -- and the filmmakers cannily use President Nixon's secret tapes to bolster their case..."
A moving documentary about motor neurone sufferer Neil Platt as he uses his last few months to gather mementoes to leave for his young son Oscar.
Would Kubrick be Kubrick without Leon? It is a good question.

"Well before the 80 minutes are up, most parents will probably tune out, but the little kids will surely feel like they are inside one fantastic candy store."
"It's a fascinating puzzle: a film that is simultaneously an indictment of the toxic legacy of cultural imperialism and a weepie that employs the familiar tropes of Hollywood, one of the biggest machines of cultural imperialism on the planet."
What's funny about exploitation? You'd be amazed.
"One of the two very smart things that the film does is to keep the original 1975 setting, as the story would have been altered far too much to be set in the digital age."
"Clooney is remarkable in Alexander Payne's film about loss, confusion and getting by."
"Republican, Democrat, or Independent, the only side THE REPORT chooses is the fight for human rights."
"The intelligence and wit of this glass-slipper heart-of-gold fantasy are shocking too, but hell hath no part of the surprise.  "
The film isn't full of revelations but it's playful and makes trees look very huggable indeed.
"Gomez-Rejon's classic-slasher-update finds a unique way to repurpose Charles B. Pierce's original material, creating a sequel/remake hybrid that's fun enough for some cheap date night scares."
A fun story for the whole family -- with some very good lessons about growing up.
"Over-hyped... But you will laugh out loud at the chutzpah and the kiddie DIY problem-solving it took to do a shot-by-shot remake of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"""
"Oferecendo uma das melhores atuações de sua brilhante carreira, Bogart cria um indivíduo assustadoramente ambíguo, enquanto Grahame ilustra com talento o conflito emocional de sua personagem."

"Hoffman and Cruise give signature performances in this thoughtful, and hugely enjoyable, classic."
"Labaki's realistic camera following Zain, whose family is undocumented migrants, takes viewers into the heart of a very real, universal issue, no, not about refugees, but the problem of unfit parenting."
"Ostensibly a comedy about inspiration and creativity, The Muse is a clunker that's actually painfully lacking in both qualities."
"[Abdel] Kechiche knows his subject and the film reflects the warmth and understanding with which he views it, though it is inordinately long at 2 hrs and 30 minutes."
"Shows that it's not only possible to make a spine-tingling World War II saga without bloodshed, but also to use such stories to examine the agonizing-but-necessary values of conscience, loyalty and forgiveness."
"An attractive, energetic young cast and some witty, off-center visual humor make the resultant laughs more than worth the wait."
"With so many ideas in play, the film is never dull. Sometimes it's also funny, perceptive and nuanced. Things get deeper and dirtier as it rolls on, but not really clearer, in terms of purpose."
"Mary Poppins Returns is solid, reliable family fare and only the hardest heart will leave the cinema bereft of a smile. It might not be another classic, but it's brolly good fun."
"It's a film that is very much in the tradition of British social realism. Nonetheless, it remains light and joyful enough to be enjoyed and recognised by an audience with the same demographic and age as the characters on screen."
"While watching ""Gold,"" I felt I had seen the story before. And, I realize that I had, many times and ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" comes to mind - without Bogey and bandits that ""don't need no stinking badges."""
"For me, Ferrara and Keitel will always be the bad lieutenant, but Werner Herzog is probably the only director qualified to take this on, and his bizarre reboot has a fascination all of its own."
"What it all amounts to is a tremendously funny feel good film that doesn't quite stand on its own so much as it plays as a great (the BEST, really) companion-piece to The Room that a cult film fan could ask for."
The film set a strong tone for modern summer blockbuster films in 1993 and continues to be one of the most iconic movies ever to hit a silver screen in the summer months.
a cheerfully silly caper comedy that mixes in a little of 'My Fair Lady' and a lot of 'The Honeymooners' as it breezes along. ...Allen and Tracey Ullman spar and slander each other with an almost maniacal glee.
"Nicely composed and played with an endearing sense of Hitchcockian humour, Grand Piano is well worth a tinkle."
Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium should delight audiences in the mood for holiday magic.
"Writer-director Chloe Zhao works methodically to set up Johnny's situation, while also capturing in poetic detail the dead-end lives of poverty, alcoholism and hopelessness on the reservation."

"Doesn't overwhelm in the least, but it retains a certain dependability and a sharp pace, finding some energy to well-worn genre routine."
"Rocketman  is a cannily honed machine, absolutely sure of its purpose, so you rather feel you've been sold a complete deluxe package... at times, consumer satisfaction is taken care of a little too aggressively for you to really feel involved."
This British import is a good-natured comedy featuring several laugh-out-loud sequences.
"This is not just fan service replaying the moments we already know and love. The film actually finds a way to authentically transpose similar moments of humor and heart into a more mature, introspective adult version of the protagonist. "
That Coppola finds occasional grace and spirit here shows understanding and compassion. Her next assignment? Make a movie that's not about the troubles of the privileged and bored.
"Succeeds, perhaps too well for us to believe Hitler was some aberration who could never happen again."
"The plot is ludicrous but one doesn't go to Luc Besson action films for character-driven storytelling; they go for exactly what this film promises and delivers -- frenetic, inspired, grin-inducing action."
"What struck me in now is that it eschews the plot, and going off into flights of comic fancy including re-doing the ending a couple times until theyre satisfied. The result is still funny, still EXCELLENT and SCHWING! Two on-air reviews in one link! "
"If these movie cops were your local police, you'd want them strung up on charges and locked away. In a fictionalized past, sure, it's still amoral, but that would only be a problem if the movie ever took itself seriously."
"A streamlined, ""Reader's Digest"" version of real-life events. However, it is a gorgeous, worthwhile re-telling thanks to a fine cast; top-notch art direction; a beautiful, mostly piano score by Stephen Warbeck; and Gabriel Beristain's ravishing cinematog"
"It's entirely ridiculous, but it gallops cheerfully along; everything is carried off with flair and ingenuity."
"There's enough juice to sustain a fan's interest for awhile. It ain't much, but watching Scully and Mulder inch closer romantically, and seeing some cool special effects is worth the price of admission."
"As comfort-blanket romcoms go, it is the rare one that will not bring you out in a rash."
"A languorous, visually striking movie about love and loss, infused with the earnestness of young people struggling with powerful emotions and with evolving ideas about life, death, art, freedom and responsibility."
The flashy style cannot hide the slight story.
Foreign-film comfort food...at its best in exploring the psychology of the adopted.
"Without a musical soundtrack and through elongated fixed planes full of internal rhythm, the film is the perfect weapon against the apostles of moral superiority. [Full review in Spanish]"

&#91;Newell and Attanasio&#93; pay as much attention to emotional details as to the clockwork details of mob life&#46;

"As a horror movie, ""Brightburn"" gets the job done but in strange ways."
"There is nothing left for the critic at this point but to corroborate all that has been said of it, to add his own warmest words of acclaim"

"Its mock-artistic thriller trappings notwithstanding, 'In Bruges' is basically a funny, tragicomic two-hander, with the casting of Farrell alongside Gleeson enabling a pleasing Irish inflection."
"A competent genre movie enlivened by vivid sense of place/culture - shot on location in New Orleans, delving into the world of merchant seaman/dock workers/smugglers."
"Treating his seafood substantially better than Oldboy, Jiro is a miracle of perfectionism married to expertise. The same can said for Gelb's loving documentary."
Franciosi grabs the film by its shoulders and turns it into a searing&#44; singular experience&#46;
A slick weepie made by smart guys who want you to know they're better than the schlockmeisters.
A totally absorbing movie.
A non-stop action fest.
Good but not great. Streep and Roberts feel a little too much like stunt-casting.
"Broader and more accessible than either Shaun Of The Dead or Hot Fuzz, Paul is pure Pegg and Frost - clever, cheeky and very, very funny."
Skyfall returns Bond to Solid Ground
"Pitt's ridiculous, wildly over-the-top performance somehow keeps it all together."
"Thanks to her infectious laugh and caustic sense of humour, as well as her honesty about what she's witnessed, we are treated to a welcome portrait of an artist who continues to radiate us with her talent."
"Despite the director's smarmy narration and interviews, the bemused equanimity of these folks who've seen it all could inspire each of us to what ""we can can"" do as we age."
Director Igal Hecht has pulled together a compelling film about an extraordinary man. There are moments of true heartbreak and tragedy mixed with wild road stories and the Iron Sheik's trademark over-the-top personality.
It's both gorgeous enough and emotionally engaging enough to be worth seeking out.
"There are lots of lovely touches, including animated sequences (the film is based on a graphic novel) and Powley is terrific - funny and wise beyond her years."
"Extraordinary...not only an engrossing first-hand account of Israel's Palestinian policies over time, but one that may have lessons to teach both Israeli leaders and other nations confronting those they identify as terrorists."
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a mind-blowing visual and mental extravaganza that leaves you in utter awe...
"It might not supplant ""It's a Wonderful Life"" in the pantheon of required December viewing, but I recommend giving it a spot in your holiday rotation."
"The perfect conversation starter, and a great way for people unable (or unwilling) to understand the trans struggle to see it from a fresh, new perspective."
"It's a surprisingly epic and spirited film, driven by an adventurous spirit and enough clever fun to keep things fresh during a sometimes long-winded ride."

"""The animation was beautiful, the storyline set in place, telling a tale of how traditions and cultures can work presently to unite us all."""
"The film is one of those rare beasts, with a sense of genuine permanency. It beds down in your mind, like it is preparing to live there for a while. It is not pretty, but it is, sometimes, very beautiful."
One of 2022&apos;s 20 best films&#46;
"At 89, Morenos petite frame still radiates star charisma and vitality. Viewers will come away from this film feeling like Moreno didnt just live life; she earned it."
"Linney and Grace play off one another beautifully, her reticent better judgment collapsing in equal proportion to his ironic detachment."
"Love it or hate it, you won't be able to leave it alone."

Masaki Kobayashi&#8217;s &#8220;Harakiri&#8221; illustrates the samurai code as a flawed system hiding behind a fa&#231;ade of honor and principle&#8212;it is undeniably the greatest anti-samurai film ever made&#46; 
Even Cecil B. DeMille might have been impressed.
"If you want a film that is big and true and tough, go see Synecdoche. And then go see it again, because it's so rich with ideas that you can't possibly get them all the first time around."
Amalric&#8217;s emotional mystery&#44; as its fragments and enigmas unfold&#44; isn&#8217;t necessarily a journey for viewers to solve but rather a state of mind to understand&#58; the bewitchingly poignant story of a woman&#8217;s fertile&#44; possibly perilous&#44; coping mechanism&#46;
"Stunning visuals and imagery, exceptional directing, and stellar performances by all the cast members make this the can't miss movie of the year."
"Entertaining and well acted, but redundant and a bit machinelike."
[A] satirical tableau of a Poland that does not recognize itself. [Full review in Spanish]
"Taking the long view that Winner's case is hardly an aberration, the director seems to inhabit the role of whistleblower as well, upending an ongoing narrative put forth by those outside the government that continues to see that true justice isn't served."
The Wayans are the masters of spoof.
intelligent and moving
"A loving paean to Bond, Flint, Helm and their ilk (as well as a myriad of outlandish villains), the film knows its turf and only missteps when it ventures into more contemporary territory."
"Whether it's ""Alex Rider,"" ""Agent Cody Banks"" or ""Spy Kids,"" plenty have tried to adapt the 007 shtick to younger characters, with demonstrably dopey results. In the end, the reason it works for Vaughn is that he's making the film for adults."
"The filmmakers have created an intensely stark and visceral representation of this hellish place, and the cinematography is intimate and stunning."
Decent 70s thriller.
"Girl Asleep might be about an awakening, but it's not a sexual awakening, and this is one teen comedy in which, at long last, the geek doesn't get the girl."
"Boasting a clever title, this is an inspired piece of lunacy about sociology versus biology, with terrific performances from Ben Stiller and his two sets of parents."
"Splice went down smooth, with its sleek surfaces, terrific special effects and disturbing sexiness."
"The Christian-themed drama God Bless the Broken Road wears its earnest heart on its sleeve, and isn't afraid to show it."
"What's special about the film is how much we come to know Frankie, perhaps more than he knows himself."
"After a muddled beginning, the deliberately paced film ties together its characters and disparate genre elements in mostly unexpected ways."
Engaging without relying on blockbuster bravado.
"Mostly, you'll just have to take my word for it that Spider-Man: Far From Home is a damned delight."
"Don't get me wrong, Spider-Man is no instant classic, but as summer blockbuster entertainment, you're not apt to find much better"
"THE PIANIST is Polanski's most personal work to date, and perhaps because of that, Polanski seems to have rediscovered the cinematic voice he had as a young man."
A pleasure. [Full review in Spanish]
"At least Ratner knows how to handle both action and drama on screen, even if subtlety and substance fall by the wayside."
Judging it by itself as a solo slasher film from 2018 it aced it... as a sequel it did even better.
Pfeiffer is outstanding.
"The directors jump into an impoverished, fast-moving life, and never attempt to put on the brakes for the sake of providing audience comfort."
Micmacs is eccentric ecstasy.   [Full review in Spanish]

... a quietly moving story of resilience.
"It is an inspirational, heart-tugging story of the kind Oscar might be willing to embrace."
"The knifelike story gets a little dull, but its ending still manages to sting."
"William Wayne, who wrote, directed, produced, edited, and stars in the film...clearly had a vision for the movie."
"Menashe may be a film of understated storytelling and plot, but its pleasures lie primarily in the wonderfully observational approach that Weinstein takes to his protagonist."
"Director Lee Chang-dong has complete mastery of the tone here and he gets great, subtle performances from his cast."
"Director Ryusuke Hamaguchi uses his ample running time to help us understand his complex, guarded characters so we cannot help but feel happy when they find some measure of happiness"
It's Swamp Thing. It's not Swamp Hamlet or MacBeth Thing.
"Cage delivers a superb performance in a role that seems specifically tailored to his abilities, helping Sarnoski find a brutal reality underneath what initially appears to be a silly concept for a revenge picture."
"[Fellin] turns the world into his circus and, in a liberated, quasi-documentary style, resurrects some of history's great pagliacci with their cornucopia of practical jokes, smashed hats, pulled chairs, popping balloons and squirting flowers."
Silly but irresistible.
"While The Long Night may not be revolutionary, it's definitely got its own dark magic."
"On the run in New York with every hitman in creation on his tail, JW needs the skills of a samurai, the reflexes of a striking snake, the speed and stealth of a wolf, a hide of pig iron and a perfectly tailored suit."
"It is a sitcom with teeth and haunting moral echoes, no small amount of vulgarity and a smart streak of comedy."
"It sounds like the latest release from Blumhouse Productions, but the documentary from filmmakers Shannon Service and Jeffrey Waldron is more frightening than any fabricated specter as the underbelly of Thailand's seafood trade is exposed."
"Imagine a Spike Jonze-Charlie Kauffman-Michel Gondry-style film but with a warm, beating heart instead of cool, detached hipster irony."
"The result is a decent picture, if one that leans pretty heavily on the future resonance of every interaction and conversation."
Springy and funny. A literary adaptation for people who don't like literary adaptations.
"Sorkin owes more to the slam-bang mayhem of Danny Boyle than the visual elegance of David Fincher, but mostly he gets out of the way of his writing - delivering for good and ill (but mostly good) a full-throttle Sorkin ride."
"In spots, the movie can be hysterical. But, for the most part, its appeal is not unlike that of a veteran rock band putting on a greatest hits concert."
"Anchored by Denzel Washington's steely presence, it's a spare, brutal vigilante exercise, with an element of righteous revenge mixed into the balance."
There's something quite wonderful about having a bear that is this free to speak its mind.
"In an age when the Shrek films make oral sex jokes and Cars 2 flip-flops between tedium and terror, the real pleasure of the gentle, graceful Winnie the Pooh is that it is a kid's film that really, truly works for kids."
The performances by Michael Douglas and Matt Damon are wonderful. The fug of jealousy and drug-fuelled paranoia is very well maintained.
A young African Christian travels to Israel in an insightful drama about the moral conflict between religious idealism and the crude materialism of the modern world.
"It's on for the relatively young and old in the sixth M.I. go-round, with Tom Cruise back on deck, Henry Cavill joining the ranks as an agenda-heavy CIA agent and Christopher McQuarrie taking the reins once more."
It's such a superlative movie that it seems better the second time you see it.
"Few films in recent history have moved me quite like Supernova, a sensitive drama starring Stanley Tucci as one half of a gay couple who is slowly but surely succumbing to dementia."
Orphan&#58; First Kill is every bit as satisfyingly twisted as its predecessor&#44; and certainly counts as the most gloriously demented horror surprise since Malignant&#46;
"""Christine"" is based on true events, and I suspect it's all the more powerful if you don't know what happens at the end. I did, but the film still gripped me."
"This latest adaptation of a rarely well-filmed novel makes a strong effort to capture the stiflingly provincial world that Flaubert was able to describe in such precise, painstaking detail on the page."
"Marlon Brando gives a bravura, dusty-voice performance in the title role as the Sicilian who harvests favours from all comers, only to ask them to be paid back."
"Fun, forgettable stuff -- but also a (slightly) better film than the reviews would have you believe."
"Mansfield 66/67 tries to pin down a mythic figure, caught in changing times, changing attitudes towards women, and the endless altercation between exploitation and empowerment."
Makes the Jumanji reboot superfluous.
If Merchant-Ivory made a horror film it would look something like this.
"It's not the tightest picture, but the primary elements are well cared for, providing a reasonable green-and-red rush of festive fun."
"Ben Is Back successfully skirts cliches and subverts addiction drama conventions, but it eventually veers into quasi-thriller territory built around the search for a stolen dog..."
"Just when it seemed as if we had lost Tom Cruise to the ranks of paycheck-cashing automatons no longer interested in applying themselves on screen, along comes American Made to show there's still some life left in the maverick actor."
"Tonally inconsistent, at least it errs on the side of ambition and cleverness; its box-office failure suggests that male genre fans don't want to be asked to identify with the victims instead of the menace."
"Gray’s latest, Armageddon Time, is a flawed work. But it sees the filmmaker at his most vulnerable, as he twists the camera back on himself and asks: of all the paths that brought me here, how many were carved out by my own privilege? "
"""Red Rocket"" remains such a blisteringly raw and febrile character study because of how things fluctuate along the fixed orbit of its star."
"Behind the camaraderie, there's a nuanced story of disenchantment and disillusionment in humanity as the result of greed and war-induced PTSD. [Full review in Spanish]"
A fantastic action thriller with Brandon Lee center stage and showing what he's capable of as a hero and action star.
&#214;stlund gives us plenty to absorb as he runs his filthy rich subjects through the wringer&#46; Some scenes are savagely funny while others are simply savage&#46; More importantly&#44; we&#8217;re always engaged&#46;
Guest seems to know just how far he can stretch reality without losing the crucial texture of verisimilitude. This is a comedy even cat lovers might adore.
On paper it looks like a carbon copy of Highlander but Theron&#46;&#46;&#46; and a series of entertaining action set pieces that are directed with verve and style by director Gina Prince-Bythewood&#46;&#46;&#46; prove you can teach The Old Guard new tricks&#46;
"Stop me if you've heard this one, but sometimes politicians get us into wars that last forever and go nowhere under false pretenses."
An assault of expressionistic techniques...
"There's tons of delicious suspense of the horror-flick variety... and plenty of Spielbergian shock-awe... but what makes it one of the most satisfying examples of found-footage flicks yet is its observational, journalistic ethos."
"The film’s effectiveness depends on what occurs on the way to the answers, and in this respect Shyamalan’s wit and sincerity serve him and the audience well."
"On the surface it looks like any other urban drama, but Tipping's use of whimsical fairy tale and sci-fi elements combines with heartbreaking social commentary for a totally unique experience."
Nelms' screenplay slyly comments on the holiday's superficial elements by cutting away the sentimental veneer.
"A witty exploration of black American culture, past and present."
"If ""Leviathan"" showed us the primal terror of everyday life, this new film is a warm hug, a salute to our shared humanity."
"An excellent comedy with the usual Woody Allen's themes, but with a great mastery of suspense. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Those hungering for rare footage of our cousins playing and foraging, fighting or fleeing are in for a number of treats."
"Aftersun is a bright, funny, immensely likeable and touching film."
...surprisingly poignant...
"A sad, compassionate piece of documentary filmmaking which considers the film industry's exploitation of child actors through a unique prism."
Much of the film is very funny as it explores the eccentricities and daily routines of these Londoners.
"Perhaps the film isn't a grandiose statement of splintered lives, but it's an agreeable drama, best when it stays close to the decomposing heart of a professional liar."
This is a work of profound and melancholic beauty; every bit as essential in the 21st century as it was in the 20th.
"A precursor to the far better Rear Window, but noir has seen better days."
A really well-assembled account of the people and the music they made.
"The incomparable Chris Rock is not known for impersonations, but he mimics Woody Allen, Richard Linklater, Louis C.K. and even Federico Fellini in his directorial pet project Top Five."
"Electric Boogaloo is required viewing for connoisseurs of trash cinema, even if none of the films included are anywhere near as good as it is."
"James Toback's Black and White is meant to be an incendiary movie, but it's really only just OK."
"Nonetheless, these reservations are not intended to diminish the eminent merits of The Best Years of Our Lives, in which the mastery of one of the world's greatest directors is ever on display. "
"[Idris] Elba isn't afraid to keep it real when it comes to visualising D's slow descent to darkness, transitioning from colourful Kingston to run-down, gritty London."
"Jesse and Celine seem like real people, complete with flaws and weaknesses. That they become so fleshed out in such a brief running time is a testament to the script and Hawke and Delpy's acting abilities."
"Warm and witty, but essentially an R-rated TV movie/history lesson."
Reaps its full portion of machismo's horrors and hosannas.
"For anyone who appreciates artistic integrity and is interested in genuinely independent films, the prolific and highly personal work of John Sayles is essential viewing."
Seeing is definitely worth believing in the Hong Kong supernatural thriller The Eye. Quite imaginative and cerebrally challenging for a spookfest narrative...never blinks when it comes to its inherent hair-raising high jinks.
It's not often that you find a film that's completely bonkers and wholesome all in one package. PG: PSYCHO GOREMAN has this in spades.
"The result is a low-key mind-bender that feels half-scripted, half improvised, and -- for the most part -- rather surprisingly compelling."

"If your heartstrings are tugged and your eyes water a bit, it’s all earned."
"The film presents the thorny, emotionally charged material with respect and abundant good humor."
"These are movies about driving cars really fast and destroying them. And, yes, the thing with the tank is awesome."
"Hanks does an admirable job of showing Sully's humiliating stress while his reputation was being challenged, with the first-rate support of a cast that includes Laura Linney as his wife, and Jamey Sheridan and Anna Gunn as his surly inquisitors."
One in a Thousand is yet another strong coming-of-age film about queer youth - further proof that these stories will never grow old so long as they're as personal and well-crafted as this.
"Big, showy and over the top with highs, lows, laughs and some truly fist-pumping performances from a diverse cast of familiar actors, most of them in roles requiring some serious belting and hoofing."
"A well-constructed, narratively audacious blockbuster released at a time when such things are in depressingly short supply."
Eli Timoner gave us a manual for how to live&#59; documenting her father&#8217;s life and death&#44; Ondi gives us a manual for how to say goodbye&#46;
"For the most part, ""Pieces of a Woman"" is a model of concentration and clout, fired up by actors of unstinting ardor."
"Beautifully and unobtrusively shot by Moritz Schultheiß, My Skinny Sister is a tender portrait of teenage angst and a salutary warning against the dangers of obsessive calorie counting."

"... Even if The Flying Scotsman doesn't really ever depart from a pretty standard-issue inspirational sports-flick template, as it's subject Graeme Obree proved, you can still do impressive and mighty things on a fixed track."
A not-very-good movie redeemed by a car chase for the ages.

Despite the early plot give-away the film's robust caricatures and gentle humour keep things bowling along nicely.
We do see New York from some interestingly different angles and Jack goes on a voyage which might inspire others like him.

A mess when it comes to the characters and writing...but works its way underneath the skin like few movies have in recent memory.
"Langourus, Fellini-esque...But Keitel seems miscast and it goes on one scene too long."
"Not only did I love every silly, gothic, gorgeous minute of Guillermo del Toro's Crimson Peak, I'm actually suspicious of those who didn't."
"An informative, entertaining, and emotional picture of a choreographer, his friends and colleagues, and his most important work..."
"...a wonderful thing, intelligent in the ways of human foible, and generous with sinners."
"Awesome! Up-ends the genre. No dialogue, no exposition, no explanation and no kissing. Just pure energy (and heroic stunt work)!"
"Though all the actors try to expand their underwritten roles, Mirren is most successful."
"Throughout this film, I am inside of what I'm told, I fear what unravels next, and the suspense is certainly transmitted in the worry I had while watching. [Full Review in Spanish]"
It is beautifully acted by leads Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva and inspires sympathy.
Documentarian Otto Bell's titular huntress - a 13-year-old Kazakh named Aisholpan who hails from a family boasting generations of champion (male) eagle hunters - is impossible not to like and/or root for.

"Wenders trains his camera on photographer Sebastiao Salgado and the result, though not without flaws, is an invigorating and interesting observation of the man, his work and the entire medium of photography."
The Iron Lady is a clever and oddly touching entertainment.
"I've never seen the stage musical Rent, but the movie had me at hello."
"A sleek, surprising and surefire thriller that will grab you by the throat."
"This heightened atmosphere sets the perfect tone for the story, which is rife with scheming, torqued emotion, and of course, incredible fight scenes."
There's so much to love here! I appreciated seeing Estella's (Cruella's) creativity shine and her bravery in facing hardship.
The twists and turns in this mystery-thriller would be enough for us to recommend it. Splendid performances by Kidman and Stan seal the deal.
"There isn't much originality in this rude female-led comedy, but its observations on single life are a nicely updated twist on the Sex and the City formula."
A devastating exploration of repressed desire and unspoken longing.
"A solid if far-fetched thriller that still entertains, even as it goes off the rails. Terrible title, mind."
"A bittersweet teen film that has much to offer even those of us who have, in theory, grown up."
"""Our Idiot Brother"" is made gently comic thanks to Rudd's fool-on-the-hill vibe and a quirky and effervescent supporting cast."
"While it's no Raging Bull, it is fun, if you're willing to roll with the punches."
"... superior [to the original] in that it makes clear the conflicting justification and degradation of the retaliation, establishing a grayer level of morality."
My favorite moment involves a Jar-Jar Binks tattoo -- and whether or not that idea strikes you as funny should be a pretty good indicator of whether or not you'll like Fanboys.
"8 Prisoners feels like a near-modern-masterpiece, with both Alexandre Moratto and Christian Malheiros cementing themselves as two of the strongest voices working in film today."
"The performances by Courtenay and Rampling are excellent. They look and act the part of an old married couple, used to each other's habits and quirks. This is an effective drama about a gathering storm in an old relationship."
"Provides Humor & Heart, But It's No Marvel"
"Like the best movies often do, ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" leaves audiences with a complex set of emotions, and with a hard-to-define hint of the profound."
"""Captain America: Civil War"" is a much better version of ""Batman v Superman."" Not only does the film juggle a dozen major superheroes pretty seamlessly, but it manages to tell a cohesive story without making the film feel too stuffed."
"Leave No Trace speaks, not just to the trauma and the damage of soldiers who have seen too much in war, but wider questions of endurance and the soul that can touch all of us."
Like the franchise it's clearly inspired by-the Step Up series-ABCD 2 tricks out simple messages with spectacular dance sequences.
"It may not be for the faint of heart, but Uncut Gems is a hell of a way to kick-start the new year, like stepping onto a moving streetcar."
"The Whale builds slowly but surely towards that mad coup de grâce, which will either leave you cold or sweep you heavenward: for me, it was a quintessential Aronofsky flourish; as loopily sublime..."
Nighthawks is a compelling movie with plenty of adrenaline-pumping chase sequences.
"An up close and personal biographical study of the activist and longstanding public servant, as well as a compelling examination of the history of the Civil Rights movement, through Lewis' vital role in it."
A fabulously well-crafted motion-picture. (...) as close to being in the bunker oneself as one can get.
"Probably one for those already enamoured with its creator, though there are numerous fascinating threads to untangle from this baroque tapestry if one has the patience."
"An acidic, anarchic layer cake of mental illness with comedy teddy bear Seth Rogen as its seal of approval. It'll be fascinating to see how this demented, treehouse feature is received by audiences accustomed to far bouncier takes on smutty giggles."
"None are as watchable as the pretty, prancing, plotting, primal Weaving, who also helps deliver some of the dark humor she teams with to save this predictable, but engaging enough summer horror silliness."
"To understand why Rhodes and Obama are so pleased with their foreign policy, you have to understand the way they think. The documentary is revealing about that."
"A wonderful family achievement, not overwrought or too sentimental, but a powerful example of the contemporary immigrant and American experience."
"The situation delivers less wackiness than it promises, and there aren't a lot of big laughs. Charm fills the void, though."
"Yeah, 'Captain America: Civil War' is true to its frenetic form as revved up entertainment preparing moviegoers for the upcoming summertime sizzle at the box office. After all, the on-screen Marvel Comics gravy train keeps moving merrily along"
A first-class thriller and thought-provoking morality play.

The third film manages to remember what the second film forgot about the first film: be fun.
"While there's stunning scenery in the movie, it's mostly a backdrop to a narrative that's more about spirit than spectacle. In this case, the subject of the film is something that can't be captured on any size screen."

The baroque blast of stylized design&#44; gothic hysteria and black humor teases&#44; terrifies&#44; and raises the drama to operatic levels&#46;
"Although it's quite long at 2 1/2 hours, Prisoners holds interest and tension thanks to the strength of the screenplay and craftsmanship of the cast and crew. Be warned: you will not want to take a bathroom break during the film, so go before"
"Gunpowder Milkshake still has its moments of fun, but the whole bloody affair is just missing a heart and a bit of soul."
"This is no doubt the first of many movies that will struggle to tell the stories of a war that's far from over, and even if the tale is imperfectly told, it commands our attention."

"It's a beautiful, melancholy film, and makes you begin to wonder if Karl Marx didn't have a point."
"This enigmatic, poetic film, co-directed by brothers Ramon and Silvan Zürcher, instils intimations of the cosmic into a deliberately ordinary narrative frame."
"2017's best feature film...a masterpiece, an emotionally affecting epic. Campillo saves his most provocative moment for last, an astounding depiction of love, death and the fight for life."

Ly is a deft orchestrator of story - and chaos.
A messed-up way to spend Mother's Day

The working title was Ship of Fools but should have been Abbott and Costello Take Some Speed.

An endearing Tibetan drama about loving others and giving up one's attachments.
"Inspiring, if Harrowing, For Sama Is for All of Us."
"For fans who ask for nothing more than something upbeat and friendly, it should satisfy, even if it isn't long remembered."

"Production design and acting aside, this film is less than one wants it to be."
"Though a clear notch beneath its classic predecessor Finding Nemo, lively pacing and a genuinely inspired finale is sure to leave viewers of all ages perfectly happy with what they have seen."

The movie is clearly intriguing in ways it may not have intended.
"It's rare that a movie that is concerned with issues currently in the headlines is more than that, but Aki Kaurismaki's touching and funny The Other Side of Hope, which focuses on the migrant crisis in Europe, pulls it off."
The Help has so much heart it's easy to feel both sorrow and enjoyment while watching such an emotional film.
Julie & Julia is a delectable cinematic concoction about two food-loving women.
"Tatum, as expected, brings depth and detail to a less than nuanced part, and the three Belgian Malinoises playing Lulu are gorgeous and, thankfully, not anthropomorphized with too many cutesy reaction shots."
The film's heart is Magdiel and the modest dreams that get him through the day but may also be the death of him.
The story twists beautifully and shockingly. The ending is brilliant. Skillfully directed by Jordan Scott.
"In short, this isn't a bad film, and it's probably worth seeing for Lady Gaga alone, but also it's not a great one."
"The Eyes of My Mother is effective and unsettling, and as a first movie from Pesce, promises much more in the future."
"How do we keep our wits about is when all that is left behind for us is chaos, confusion and fear? ( ... ) it is generational trauma that is the Big Bad for a new generation."

The new film hints mischievously at the kind of dysfunction that would truly bring the Brady bunch up to date.

This gripping (or nauseating) film has power beyond its ideas.
A very frank and gritty story about two brothers.
"""The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby: Them"" is worth seeing, if only for the way the camera lingers on Jessica Chastain as if she's a silken magnet."

Three generations of women struggle to survive in an inhospitable wilderness in Brazil far from civilization.
"A dizzyingly attractive film that breaks down Noam Chomsky's ideas, filters them through Michel Gondry's unique way of seeing, and in the process breaks down the differences between art, science and philosophy"

A genial and glossy middle-brow rom/com blended together with corny Capra-like political drama.
Dench makes mincemeat of the often pedantic material.

"At the film's core is the question, what if some love is based not on love but in a dichotomy of horrific power and desire?"
Repulsive but mesmerizing.
We see the seeds of something special here; Palmer cements herself here as one to watch in the years to come.
"It manages to infuse its simple narrative with a spicily subversive attitude toward traditional gender roles, while spooning its audience generous helpings of sweetly seductive costume romance."

Elephant invites scrutiny but defies explanation.
Sidney Lumet returns to the sort of form he showed in his heyday. It helps that we're on Lumet's favourite territory -- the heist gone wrong.

The first part of The Phantom could almost be a summation to the jury by the prosecution.
Paul Green is like the crazy uncle that your kids love to be around even if he makes them cry.
"For the most part this is an entertaining, and old-fashioned feeling film."
Breaking the rules has never seemed so fun . . . or so necessary.

"Along with The Postman segment from Satyajit Ray's Two Daughters, it is, I think, the greatest short film ever made."
"Lohman adapts to the changes required of her, but the actress and director Peter Kosminsky never get the audience to break through the wall her character erects"
"Precious captures how a lost girl rouses herself from the dead, and Daniels shows unflinching courage as a filmmaker by going this deep into the pathologies that may still linger in the closets of some impoverished inner-city lives."
"Sayles' prolix narrative, weighed down with subplots and characters and canvassing many social ills, dilutes the impact of a work that should nevertheless still make an impact on thoughtful viewers."
His latest offering is as vibrant as any he has produced.
Reno himself can take credit for most of the movie's success. He's one of the few 'cool' actors who never seems aware of his own coolness.
"There may be much that is familiar, but with this version Wright nevertheless manages to be both reverent and innovative, with more than a dash of ... panache."
"A well-crafted tearjerker with a grown-up performance from Zac Efron. If you don't mind risking dehydration, it's the movie for you."
The deliriously demented 1960s Japanese show 'Johnny Sokko and His Flying Robot' proves to be a stronger influence on 'Pacific Rim' than any Godzilla movie.
... A suspense masterpiece ...

"Weitz's rousing satire is no dream: It's the mad, mad real world of America in the year 2006."
"On the surface a literate werewolf thriller, the subtext of Mike Nichols' Wolf is a sharp critique about what it takes to succeed in the cutthroat corporate world."
"Efficient and highly effective in its style, relying on sound, creepy production design, and the men's own fear and misjudgment to create the sense of pervasive doom."
"Yesterday fulfills its modest ambitions with warmth and gentle humor. It wouldn't, however, make any impact if it were magically erased from existence."
"This beautiful 2K restoration...features the original intertitles while simulating the color tinting and toning of the original not seen since the 1920's...Unveiled at the 2016 Berlin Film Festival, Kino Lorber's release is a real treat for cinephiles."

I will probably get a few digs from my friends for insisting that Ford v. Ferrari is not only entertaining but also smart.
"For those seeking a wickedly dark little confection, Thoroughbreds should prove a diverting watch; but those looking for anything deeper will find a lot left to be desired."
"Pushes the idea of the capricious monarch through the far reaches of comedy and almost into tragedy. Colman embodies sublimely the punch-drunk confusion of a woman unsure whether she's child or adult, plaything or puppet-master."
"The sort of romance that doesn't come around too often&#151;intelligent without being saccharine, heartfelt without being condescending."
If you've seen 'You Can Count on Me' you have a pretty good idea where 'The Skeleton Twins' is headed in its somewhat didactic approach to celebrating the unbreakable bonds siblings share. Yet you admire it just the same.

"Anxiety inducing imagery aside, I already want to watch this flick again."
"Set in the ruthlessly competitive ballet world, Black Swan is a trashy melodrama with a glossy artsy treatment, but it's gripping due to its speed and Natalie Portman's Oscar-caliber performance."
"As remakes go, Disney's latest might just be their best one yet, soaring to such stratospheric heights I almost can't help but be amazed."
"It's quaint, a little rustic but magical in its own way."
Ant-Man is great; an optimistic jaunt with plenty of cleverness and oodles of joy. Yet another feather in Marvel Studio's increasingly peacocked cap.

Its blend of speed and music makes 'Baby Driver' one of the year's best films.

"It has a light, shaggy charm, and De Niro is at his most winningly comical."
The Pianist is Polanski's best film.
"...the movie remains watchable even through the sporadic lulls within the narrative, something that's due almost entirely to Gervais' almost ridiculously entertaining performance."

VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN is an enjoyable - if more than a bit silly - take on the classic story.
"[A] rich, fun and fascinating film experience."
"Senna feels a touch too short to be fully realized -- but then again, so was Ayrton Senna's life."
"It ... is worth watching for its crackerjack opening and the strength of its young cast, but mainly because of its inherent promise of (possibly) better things to come."
"I loved this, it's hilarious, heart warming and a little stroke of genius.."
"Shanghai Noon feels both like a flashback to an earlier time of more innocent pictures, and also slightly predictive of the vanguard of colourful comic-book cinema to come."
"Tully is worth a look for its true-to-life characters, its sensitive acting, its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer Hilary Birmingham."

"This film barely brushes up against the many, many issues it raises, but those conversations can be had in the lobby, after the pleasure of watching an underappreciated artist finally get her due."

One of the best originals that the platform has produced. [Full review in Spanish]
"While everyone remembers this film about an autistic man as Dustin Hoffman's Oscar-winning triumph, it is equally Tom Cruise's."
"It's not entirely clear how much of Big Game is funny on purpose, but it hardly matters when the action is so slick and the dialogue so ripe."

"Mathieu Kassovitz is making a determined challenge for the stylish French sci-fi thriller crown of Luc Besson with this highly effective, highly charged action movie, even though he has had to rather mangle the novel on which it is based"
"[I]ts daffy, otherworldly story, rehearsing but not rehashing Stillman's frankly reactionary instincts, resounds less for its charming gaggle of collegiate women than for its dramatization of self-deception and the despair of depression."
A riveting and quirky movie about the aftershocks of 9/11 in the lives of a group of people still in denial a year later.
This contradiction - an activist for social justice with a blue-blooded partner - is sadly never explored.

It's an achingly poignant meditation on passion and loneliness in oxygen-choked Kuala Lumpur.
"Great documentaries, of which this is one, need great subjects, and Mr. Honnold fills the bill; he's thoughtful, funny, articulate, self-reflective and fatalistic to a scary degree."
"Adheres to the dumb/smart approach of other classics such as Airplane! and The Naked Gun. Opens strong, gets a lot of funny jokes in and then loses steam heading into the finale, but a worthy early horror parody nonetheless"
"Will appeal mostly to those who love theater and relish the opportunity to see a production being built, scene by scene."
"The craftsmanship of ""A War"" is unimpeachable. Tight shots and jittery camera work give the film an immediate, intimate feel."
"Ayers's warmest film to date finds meaning and depth in its ""I love you, man"" exchanges and rarely goes too long without staging some daring detective work and videogame ultraviolence."
"More than a narrative, the film is a study in visual ways to convey the ""swimmy,"" unreal sensations of love at first sight."
"Detroit is a gut-punch of a movie, one that pulls you in to the ugliness lying beneath the American id."
A slick and stylish horror comedy which delivers on both fronts.
"The Iperess File is a thriller set in a recognisable London where espionage is a seedy business conducted, not by impregnable Bonds, but by men as scared and venal as anyone else."
"Writer-director Sofia Coppola has produced a small-scale movie that exalts old-fashioned movie-making qualities, yielding a refreshingly understated alternative to a sea of summer blockbusters."

This is an inspirational film about perseverance.

Director Sollett adds a humanistic layer of insight and wisdom to the story that transcends teen-pic formulas.
One of the best films of the year-it salutes openness and respect for life as antidotes to the use of violence to deal with the uncertainty and insecurity of our times.
The final 20 minutes of the film prove once again that what you can't see is infinitely more frightening than what you can..leaves you goosey and tense.
Funny when it needs to be. I don't know what more you can ask from the third installment of a series that has gone further than anyone reasonably could have expected.
"Politics aside, Herzog uses a realistic tone to depict a high-energy capture and escape."
"Like most of Grisham's stories, the set-up is better than the wrap-up, but this is a cast that knows how to satisfy, even when the material doesn't."
...a perfectly watchable (yet undeniably overlong) entry in an almost remarkably consistent series...
"As the characters get more intimate, so too does the film, with McCormack and, especially, Thompson cutting through the film’s more mechanical execution to deliver rounded portraits of people yearning for human connection in a judgmental world."
"The film is effective even when didactic, and Munn is terrific."
"For Daniel Craig the world of Bond could not be more far away: if his East European accent wobbles at times to Liev Schreiber's more authentic vocal, he looks the part of a man who can both kill and care."
"Adam Brody keeps the unnamed protagonist distant, strangely blank, as if part of his problem is his lack of any real personality of his own, prompting him to parasitise the charismatic women he meets and try to substitute scandalous behaviour for depth."
May be the finest thriller/romance hybrid of the new century.
"Its vision is unique and harrowing, its song hits to the heart."

"It's a story designed to play the heartstrings like a fiddle, extracting sighs and sobs from willing viewers with surgical precision."
"The only slipup is a forgivable one. Jackson continues to be reluctant to leave a world he has so magnificently created. At a little over three hours, King Kong is a bit of a bum-number."
"There are plenty of great things about American Honey, but when stretched out to an incomprehensibly epic length, it is hard to see it as anything other than wasted potential."
"The film has grace, rhythm and music for a while with the story of the young man who only yearns to escape the crime world to rebuild his life. [Full review in Spanish]"
"It's no Jaws, but The Shallows is still a viciously, violently fun wave to ride."
"Delivers a hell of a lot of thrills as an R-rated romp that's refreshingly standalone, not trying to set up any sequels."
"Boyle -- and maybe Sorkin, though the domineering Sorkinese makes it hard to surmise -- is doing something smarter, even outright subversive."
"There are times in Christopher Nolan's somnolent crime caper where you'll find yourself recognizing moments from your own subconscious on the screen, to a thrilling, frightening and ultimately inspiring effect."

"With some cool superhero action, Megamind is mildly amusing for the most part, but it feels like it could have been much better."
"Here, with everything that he's ever cared about on the line, Hunt proves why he's summer's most valuable action hero."
"""Scream 4"" lacks the qualities that would make it a masterpiece, but it testifies to the cyclical nature of commercial storytelling in sharp, nearly timeless fashion."
"The premise is ridiculously simple - take out your phone and film family members as they chat - but when your family is as expressive and poetic as Panahi's, most of your job is done for you."
Peter Dinklage is excellent as the mob's chief lawyer.
"Surprisingly candid, comprehensive and, most of all, emotional expos of the wrestling business."
"Follows [Pekar's] journey with originality, humor and humanity"

Iron Man is an action sci-fi blockbuster extravaganza that provides cartoon thrills for thinking people. It's the best movie of its kind since the second Spider-Man movie four years ago.
"The director's affectionate warts-and-all portrait of his milieu and subculture is blistering, cogently capturing how England's early-'80s skinhead movement was driven less by blind racial intolerance than by intense socio-economic tensions."
"The movie is self-pity disguised as self-sacrifice (he'll do anything for his fans) but it's also, by any measure, often funny."
This is terrific film-making - enough to bring a rush of blood to the head.
"Whether you know it or not, kids, you've now got your own generation's Close Encounters of The Third Kind."
Athlete A raises a lot of questions about the USAG's practices.
"The Unborn is a culty midnight movie that, like far more such films than we tend to credit, has a brain whose synapses are constantly firing away just beneath all the gore."
"Cove is a stirring call to arms, providing the damning dolphin massacre argument forcefully and creatively. I can't say the film will change the world, but it certainly will make those trips to Sea World more awkward."
"Maguire's otherworldly coolness suits the observer drawn into a story he might prefer only to watch. DiCaprio is persuasive as the little boy lost impersonating a tough guy, and Mulligan finds ways to express Daisy's magnetism and weakness."
"""The Day after Tomorrow is junk, but it's not a rip-off. Emmerich sincerely wants to entertain you, which is more than you can say for most of his Hollywood peers."""
"Kumail Nanjani and Issa Rae's chemistry and ease of dialogue make The Lovebirds feel like a throwback to corny, yet entertains Golden-Age rom coms. Unicorn suits, milkshake monologues and ride share jokes are worth the ride."
"An accomplished, insightful, touching film."
&quot;The Lighthouse&quot; has echoes of Melville and Lovecraft as well as Coleridge and Greek mythology&#44; all stirred together in a psychedelic stew&#44; or a cup of turpentine and honey&#46; The honey is the film&apos;s sumptuous aesthetic&#46;
"It willingly follows its characters into the muck of brotherly love, misery, impulse and idiocy."
"A lot of The Descendants is affecting, but its mushier tone is often less emotionally resonant than the bitter sarcasm of Payne's earlier work."
"It has dryly obscene, laugh-out-loud lines, and its portrait of Hollywood as a giant anxiety attack is fused by De Niro, who musters a desperate, nagging warmth beneath his grumbly facade."
"A Monster Calls may seem like a simple fantasy film, but it goes beyond that to tackle a very real tragedy - losing someone. Word of advice: bring a lot of tissues to this one."
You won't be able to dismiss this movie as easily as Etienne ignores Lolita.
a masterpiece of action adventure science fiction fueled by a terrific international cast...Joon-ho has more on his mind than startling imagery and violence and his climax is both breathtaking and an emotional gut punch.
I Served the King of England ends up a curious combination of raunchy merriment and malignant undercurrents.
... a dramedy thatll have you laughing through tears.
A tight-fisted and paranoid mini-classic.
"Bielinsky's script is slick and fiendishly clever, with seemingly a twist a minute."
"Forget motion-capture, this is motion-rapture. Meanwhile, Oscar-winning composer Michael Giacchino (Up) finds some extraordinary piano notes to emphasise contemplative silence as much as imminent threat."
This is an almost apocalyptic tale of thwarted emotion - love cut short - set in a pitiless land of delusions.
"It's too much of a stretch to say Venom is ""good,"" but it's certainly not terrible, and maybe worth seeing for Hardy alone."
"One of the broadest, silliest (yet somehow still endearing) stoner comedies in a while, indulging the adult members of the cast with particular gusto."
"It's just, like ... well, a lot like real life for 20-somethings."
"Through her constant swings between the public and the private, Whitney tears the icon and reveals a soul. [Full Review in Spanish]"
It's Levy and his chemistry with Jackson that keeps The Man from being ho-hum.
Wright remarkably shows you how instead of iron fists as tools&#44; we see Edgerton&#8217;s Mark uses something entirely different &#8212; empathy&#46;
"Nichols ... tells the Lovings' story in a way that feels immediate and modern, and not just like a history lesson."
"The movie is poppy, clever and more than enjoyable, but Posey is something else altogether. She's a revelation."
"This is an, at times, terrifying film that, refreshingly, does not rely on cheap jump scares."
Nymphomaniac isn't as much about female power as the dialogue occasionally suggests; it's more about being misunderstood because of the things you choose (or are compelled) to pursue.
"This good natured film feels like an episode of Nashville mixed with an episode of Friday Night Lights, two television shows I happen to enjoy, in spite of their soapiness."
Luck doesn&#8217;t break a lot of new ground&#46; But the movie has some creative elements and likable characters&#46; The animation is solid&#44; though not eye popping&#46; The voice cast is good&#46; &#46;&#46;&#46; It&#8217;s a rare movie these days that has both a G-rating and a plot&#46;
"Olivier Martinez makes the kind of visceral impression Brad Pitt made in Thelma and Louise, but it's Gere's layered performance that makes Unfaithful a sophisticated, interesting adult drama."
"Marketed as a guitar summit between The Edge, Jimmy Page, and Jack White, Davis Guggenheim's affectionate, intermittently insightful behind-the-music doc is more electric triptych than meeting of the minds."
"Its nastiness sings, instead of stings."
"The protagonists are likable, have charismatic chemistry, and are portrayed brilliantly. You will love to hate the well crafted antagonist who creates obstacles for our leads."
"For a film that's just shy of being three hours long, it never felt bloated; every sequence seemed to have its place, and at the right pace..."
"Harari chooses to create a psychological portrait of his central character, using images rather than explanations of ideology to tap into Onoda’s mind-set."
"While King Arthur is not Guy Ritchie gold, it is an entertaining film that serves up the right amount of thrills, spills and wit."
"This powerful, heartfelt and important drama from one of the great names in world cinema deserves to be seen."
You know how much of a guy flick this is? There's no women in it.
A profoundly sexist and eminently hummable 1954 CinemaScope musical with some terrific athletic Michael Kidd choreography and some better-than-average direction by Stanley Donen.
A Hidden Life is a commanding piece of cinema that lingers long after you've left the theatre.
Something that the whole family can love.
A great big hug of a film.
"Gook may not come close to the electric greatness of Lee's 1989 film but, as a gesture in its direction, it's alive with biting promise."
Arkadina is one of literature's most narcissistic mothers - which is saying something - and yet Bening makes her damnably human.
"Friendsgiving is not destined to be a holiday classic, but it shows that with a good script and a talented cast, even an old formula can result in a surprisingly entertaining movie."
"Rosi celebrates the harsh beauty of the island in many long shots, as well as the humanity and patience of the islanders."
"A good action yarn, burdened from time to time by excessive dialogue, about the professional rodeo circuit and the hardy horse-tamers who inhabit it."
"A sterling effort in the eventually overplayed ""found footage"" genre."
Patrice Ch&#233;reau's startling drama recounts the dissolution of a marriage of a couple (Pascal Greggory and Isabelle Huppert) from the haute bourgeoisie.
"A pop-punk re-up of the lively, amusing 1976 Disney original that stands as a credibly entertaining family film due chiefly to the presence of its two deft, personable comediennes."
Features a strong performance from the criminally underrated Robert Pattinson.
"Reilly is fantastic, the music is right on, and the commentary is obnoxiously accurate, so while Walk Hard may not go to 11, it's definitely worth a seven or an eight."
"If this truly is the end of this tale on the big-screen, it's going out in grand fashion."
A solid laugh machine...
There is a magnificent introspection about the dichotomy between dream and memory. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Griffith has honestly never been funnier, and Play the Game is a delightful, thoroughly entertaining romantic comedy that reminds us all just why we fell in love with him in the first place."
"The deck is stacked, and the disingenuousness is profound, but director John Lee Hancock is good at saving his big schmaltz cards to play at the end."
"The picture is also further evidence that no matter how beautifully rendered it is or how complex the emotional context, and Big Fish & Begonia is both beautiful and complex, any shot of a sea creature leaping over a human will invoke Free Willy."
"While Platoon is easily one of the year's finest films, I'm not sure if it's the long-awaited definitive Vietnam movie, as some early reviews have suggested. But it is the gamest attempt so far to explain how America suffered a humiliating defeat."
"Gilligan has proven, again and again, that he is a skilled storyteller in this universe, and if a post-finale finale had to exist, El Camino is a lovely coda that puts Jesse's tortured soul to rest, in a way."
"A monumental mockumentary from Brit cinema's premier director/actor double act. True, daft, emotional, hilarious."
Of interest today strictly for Lon Chaney's bell-ringing performance.
"Renewed purpose to this part two, finding Catching Fire skillfully communicating beats of unrest and despair, locating a way to help the ongoing franchise settle in as an energizing story of an underground uprising."

"Welcome back Renée, we missed you."

What is it about high-school overachievers that gets the goat of movie directors these days?

"It's worth checking out, though it's unlikely to be anyone's repeat favorite."
"What a firebrand Lady Gaga embodies in this movie. Surrounded by renowned actors, she commands our focus. Even as the plot slows to a crawl, when she appears, the sparks fly."
"If you go into this movie expecting something like ""John Wick"" crossed with ""Gunda,"" prepare to have your expectations upended as ""Pig"" is a melancholy, almost spiritual, meditation on what makes life worth living."

One of Brooks' most broadly entertaining films.
It's a human drama which stays with you for quite some time afterwards.
"Luckily, Chadwick Boseman is the protagonist... it's thanks to him it is that we forget all of the story's mistakes a little bit. [Full review in Spanish]"
"It doesn't expose stupidity. That's what Cohen has done absolutely wonderfully in the past with his other characters. Now he's just acting stupid, with only some funny results."
"Although ""Triple 9"" was most likely just a paycheck film for all involved, its go-for-the-gut efficiency can't be denied."
"The movie is smart and funny, though ultimately it's less noteworthy as an entertainment than as a marketing concept."
"The David versus Goliath battle for justice - the abuse victims versus the stonewalling by the Vatican - does not end as I expected. Then again, with the Church's not so enviable track record, maybe it is just what I expected."
"Ficarra and Requa direct some fascinating sequences, including a long, brisk montage of illegal acts that shows us how Nicky's team operates."
"Leave No Trace, in the biggest of ironies, leaves the greatest of traces upon us."
"Writer-director Leslye Headland has made a film that is saucy and sweet, for the boys and for the girls -- an R-rated Seinfeld, not that there's anything wrong with that."
Sophisticated sci-fi - stunningly well-crafted and acted.
"The first thing you will notice as you watch this film, and be distracted by, is how much Washington sounds like his father, Denzel Washington. Once you get over this, the story draws you in."
Does an insult carry the same weight of a physical assault?
"Lubitsch sees the round of coincidences as a game of cruel destiny, albeit one that's played on the world stage against a backdrop of looming war."
"Every year, there are a handful of pleasant and unpleasant surprises in multiplexes. Count Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle among the former."
"The movie shows how you can rationalise the ends justifying the means, but you don't know where the ends will take you."
American Made sure makes zipping around in planes loaded with ill-gotten jewels seem like a lot of fun.
&#46;&#46;&#46;Even though Unbreakable&apos;s superhero side is shaky&#44; Shyamalan&apos;s fourth film is ultimately a success&#8212;as best seen in the strength of the Dunn family story and a genuinely exciting climactic fight&#46;

There are moments in Zathura of pure delight and wonder.
"A searching examination of middle-class complacency and gender roles in an age of us-or-them individualism, this assured Swedish drama is the kind of film that's hard to watch and harder still to tear your eyes away from."
A fantastic experience with one hell of a darkly sense of humor horror fans will appreciate.
"While Gordon-Levitt leans hard on an overcompensatory Timberlake scowl, he's kept real by the rest of the ensemble."

The most visually expressive of Noah Baumbach's oeuvre.
"A grounded, sympathetic and often grimly comic portrayal of motherhood."
"Abrangente, jornalisticamente impecável, inteligente, complexo e socialmente responsável - mas também repetitivo e mais longo do que o ideal."
"You'll have to work to get the most out of 'Red Riding,' but if you are as diligent as Piggot, the mystery is worth it."
...a thrilling ride...
"Teenage casts an intoxicating spell, but in the haze of war and underground dance parties, it doesn't have the time to help us understand what the hell it all means."
Superhero films are rarely imbued with this level of emotional resonance and gravitas&#44; and even though it doesn&apos;t reach the heights of the original Black Panther&#44; it&apos;s still head and shoulders above the MCU&apos;s other post-Avengers&#58; Endgame offerings&#46; 
"Holly and Marina may not always be good for each other, but together they tell us a great deal about people who need each other -- a group that ultimately includes all of us."
Javier Bardem is magnificent in this darkly comic and timely workplace satire that mirrors the constant power struggles in today&apos;s world&#46; &#91;Full Review in Spanish&#93;
What a terrific funny and terrifying portrait of particular American Lunacy this is.
"Still enthrals with its sweeping direction, gentle humour and lack of pretension."
"The adorable nerds featured are as charismatic as they are bright, and I assume it was a combination of their personalities and projects that led to their inclusion in the film."
"Crudup's Zimbardo shifts from ruthlessness to panic, but that shift isn't nearly as marked as what we observe among his subjects."
"[VIDEO] ""The Mill and the Cross"" represents the closest any filmmaker has come in the age-old pursuit of translating a painting into a living, breathing, cinematic context."
Skyscraper is one of the most idiotic action movies to come down the pike in some time. It's also a lot of fun if you're willing to go with it...
"Simultaneously a spoof, throwback, and tribute to the ballets of violence that precede it, Shoot 'Em Up is the guilty pleasure of the year."
It is the work of an artist; every shot is carefully composed.
"On every level, ""No"" leaves one with bittersweet feelings about democracy, love and the cost of compromise."
"This animated theme-park ride won't scare genre veterans. But it'll do as a Pot Noodle snack until such horror entrées as Hereditary, Cold Hell, and Mom and Dad arrive."
A well-made thriller that serves as an allegory for contemporary Brazilian society.
Streep's performance will probably secure her another Oscar nomination.

"McCarthy shows he's mastered the things we already know scare us onscreen; next, how about something we don't expect?"
"It is Fassbender, in dual roles, who is the real focus of the movie, and he is the best he's been in years-perverse, haunted, magnetic, touching and unique."
"It isn't history but free-range fiction, a venomous farce containing nuggets of fact, and if its subjects bear any resemblance to present-day dictators and authoritarian mugs or thugs around the world, then the movie has hit its archetypal target."
"Rest easy, America. The Guest can take on ISIL single-handedly--after entertaining the terrorist army with a clever script."
Odd feminist fun.
"Tokyo's bustling downtown has never looked so vibrant and distinctive on film, and the titular blossoms are an eye-popping metaphor for the film's approach to life."
"Edited and shot with a syncopated style mimicking the work of his subjects, Pray turns the idea of the documentary on its head, making it rousing, invigorating fun lacking any MTV puffery."
"Georges' irreversible decision may be courageous, but it requires no sacrifice on the part of his creator: for Haneke, it's business as usual."
Heath Ledger is great.
"Ducournau is a new breed of filmmaker who isn't afraid of breaking conventions. With Larrain's Ema early this year, Titane is one of the most exhilarating films I've seen this year."
[A] bold proposal. [Full review in Spanish]
"Spectacular, fresh, and unique. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The important thing is that while the production never reaches for intellectual grandeur, it is on a very basic level one of the funniest movies of the year."
A towering landmark for filmic fictionalizations of the Holocaust.
Maddeningly episodic.
"[Its] moral ambiguity will drive some viewers nuts, but in my view it is also the quality that makes ""Zero Dark Thirty"" something close to a masterpiece."
This whizz-bang breakthrough in mixing live action with cartoon characters won a special achievement Oscar for animator Richard Williams.
"It would be funny if the surprise ending was that the newspaper just folded so the reporters had to abandon the case. I mean, someone still has to pay for their efforts. Exposing conspiracy and defending the public interest isn't free."
Tolerate the silly and swoony story and allow yourself to drift away in the gorgeous Caleb Deschanel photography.
"These young people are a spirited bunch, led by Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, two bright-faced newcomers who lend the proceedings the appropriate sense of grounding and awe."
"Colbert steals scenes as Chuck Noblet . . . The cracked, sordid style of Strangers with Candy half-bewilders and half-appalls you into laughing."
"A methodical, but workable suspense film with one big action scene."
Mr. Spacey and his estimable supporting cast bring skill and commitment to their roles; they respect their characters and demand as much from the audience.
full review in Greek
The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975 is not your standard documentary dealing with racism in America.
Proves that there is always room for another [World War II] story if it can be presented in an original and unexpected fashion.
"Drag Me To Hell is never less than trashy, adrenalised fun."
The mixture of the mundane and the poetic in 'Elephant' creates a mesmerizing mood...reinforces Van Sant's position as one of the minimalist magicians of contemporary cinema.
"New Order is a bold film that will continue to divide viewers and critics alike, but ultimately, if it forces more discourse on the vast and growing disparity between the rich and the poor, maybe that's exactly as Franco intended."
"May not deserve the adjective of the title, but Vega certainly does; her performance makes an imperfect film worth seeing."
The action scenes are spectacular. But the slightly jumbled story and mob of new characters pulls focus from what makes the film work the best -- the original group of costumed characters.
"It is a true auteur creation that is absurd and exhilarating, a fun-house mirror reflecting our times and the folly of women who seek to control a patriarchal system by submitting to it."
"It's not really a movie. It's Johnny Knoxville and his Jackass crew faking out real people into believing he's 86-year-old Irving Zisman, an old fart bag traveling cross-country."
"The film is an exquisite feast for the mind, it's not so much for the action or jump scares. Whatever you think about Black Christmas, you cannot deny its importance."

"It's not scary-horror, but it should scare the stuffing out of anybody who has contemplated their own failing memory. That prospect is far scarier than anything Freddy Krueger ever threw at us."
Codirectors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders understand more about visualizing the joy of flight than James Cameron ever will.
"Hugely startling, challenging, and mesmerizing, perhaps even a masterpiece."

"Compared to something as extraordinary as his Talk to Her, Volver may seem like a light little soap opera, but its strength, grace and resiliency should not be underestimated."
"The experience overall is like laughing down a gun barrel, a little bit tiring, a lot sick and maybe far too perverse for less jaded moviegoers."
John Wick has been a boogeyman&#44; the Baba Yaga&#44; an enigmatic cypher in the vein of so many cinematic assassins that came before him&#44; but most of all&#44; the franchise points out&#44; he&#8217;s simply a man who loved&#44; and was loved in return&#46; 
"159 minutes represents a heavy investment in time and popcorn. But the unrelenting pace, almighty effects and sheer tongue-in-cheekiness make it more than worth your while."
Josh Brolin is terrific as Mannix. I chortled and laughed through the whole thing. And I smiled for hours afterward thinking about it.

"It's just a little too jarring to be top notch, but it sure is powerful."

Each of the actors smoulders with quiet strength.
It&#8217;s a truly great blockbuster&#44; one that surpasses the earlier theater release in every conceivable way&#46;

"LaBute's films have much to say even if they can be overwhelming. Unlike action films you forget in an hour, his movies will stay with you for years afterwards, provoking thought and reflection."
"Mildly compelling and amusing, but somewhat uneven and dull. The sexy Trieste Kelly Dunn invigorates the film in a radiant, charismatic performance."
"Terrifically spooky and original, the film continues to feel completely modern despite being almost a quarter-century old."

"Less a horror film than a valentine, from a daughter to a father, and a sweet portrait of a man going gently into that good night."
"Combines a few lovable Hollywood icons, an admittedly goofball plot, some sweet-natured romance, and brilliant rapid-fire exchanges of breathless comedic dialogue."
"Yamada and crew almost go so far as to suggest that the Japanese had their A-bombs coming to them, if it weren't for the achingly sympathetic family at the film's core."
The full force of Obayashi's preference for the experimental makes itself felt.

Fun to watch!

"If a bracing brew of criminal connivance and exquisite bloodletting is to your liking, Takeshi certainly provides it."
"""Love is making someone who is sad feel happy,"" one girl says, answering an interviewer's question. ""Blood Brother"" showed me that love. I doubt I'll be the only one."

The Jungle Book is everything it was expected to be and so much more.

It feels human. It is human. And it's the best film of the year.

But something strange happens once Drew Barrymore shows up -- the movie starts getting good. Really good.

"Despite a predictable story and some awkward visuals, Giant Slayer is surprisingly entertaining - thanks to a hefty dose of well-timed humor and energetic performances."

The ending feels at odds with the rest of the film.
...a wonderful time warp movie with pace and style.
"Not content with a basic premise of crime and punishment, director Bong Joon Ho goes a step further, eventually corkscrewing off on a tangent that drags out the running time."
Turn your brain off and turn up the blood splatter.
"It just about works, but it's a long way from perfect."

"An icily slick and funny Florida urban thriller in the style of Carl Hiaasen, carried with great deadpan style by Paige."
"A great role for a truly great talent, who just happens to be in her 70s. The movie is just under 90 minutes, but Tomlin delivers in that short time. Her wise-cracking one-liners are tempered by a real sense of loss and vulnerability."

"Moors is neither showy nor exploitative in his telling of the story. He just lays out the details, making ""Blue Caprice"" not just a story of horror, but of tragedy."
"A delightful storyteller, Troche comes up with wholly unexpected and consistently effective bits of visual punctuation and she has a subtle way with sensuality and a secure touch with non-professional actors."
A violent movie about the routine as a safe place and how this one lack in our everyday life. [Full review in Spanish]
"Shooting in crisp black-and-white and with sparse dialogue (on title cards), Berger creates gorgeous scenes that evoke not only the silent era but early '30s horror (including a reference to Tod Browning's Freaks that's oddly endearing)."
"This seventh film in the Planet of the Apes series rises to such ridiculous heights, it's impossible not to laugh out loud -- in a good way, in appreciation."
"Though replete with amusing situations and clever lines, its strongest suit is the delicately pitched comic performances of its actors, most especially star Kevin Kline."
"Along With the Gods: The Two Worlds is an inquisition into human flaws, using Ja-hong as a vehicle to explore how they can be redeemed as such."
"""Catch Me"" feels capable of charming the masses with star power, a pop-induced score and sentimental moments that have become a Spielberg trademark."
"Chadwick Boseman is so formidable that, were the film itself just a bit better, he would eventually be basking in the same sort of year-end accolades that greeted Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles and Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash. Who knows, he may yet."
"It's a breathtakingly beautiful film, never mawkish, never less than vibrantly real and never more affecting than when it explores the nature of a love that 'dare not speak its name', not in Nazi Germany"
"A simple story worth watching for its depiction of prejudice and discrimination Mexican Americans experienced in Los Angeles. Not a perfect film, but a movie worth your time for the simple fact that in the 1950s these stories were being told."
"The wonder of this explosively funny, tautly dangerous movie is that it's without a single false note."
Hood knows how to crank the tension and a certain fury ticks under the story.
"Slesin, who's already won an Oscar for her documentary, ""Ten Year Lunch: The Wit and The Legend of the Algonquin Round Table,"" should at least be racking up another nomination with this sterling effort."
"""Try Harder!"" puts human faces on the college admissions fiasco, prompting viewers to empathize with overachievers unaccustomed to failure and whose self-worth is inextricably tied to which universities they get into."
"In spite of the pervasive melancholy, ""Stan & Ollie"" also carries a sweetness and dignity that ennobles its subjects. A lot of that has to do with the warm performances from Coogan and Reilly, who disappear into their roles."
One of the insights writer-director Johnson brings to the movie is a political and cultural awareness of what is going on in today's society - a denigration and suspicion of outsiders.
"The characters aren't much more well-defined than the anonymous victims of a teen horror movie... The dinosaur effects, however, are absolutely stunning, and sometimes so natural that one even forgets to be impressed."
"You might cringe at some moments, but you'll also probably laugh and maybe even have a good time. I'd watch this for 24 hours straight before watching Fan4stic ever again."
"Like its star, it's quietly sincere and compulsively watchable."
"Matsumoto and Mitsuyoshi Takasu trade the grand for the gargantuan, the battle-drama for the video game fight."
"...whole-heartedly casts its lot with the grown-ups in the audience, paying homage to Sergio Leone, Carlos Castaneda, Hunter S. Thompson, and Roman Polanski's Chinatown. ...So, let's dispel the illusion that this movie is for kids."
The new singing animals adventure feels more mature in every way. [Full review in Spanish]
"Travelers and Magicians is deeply affecting. It plays, in itself, like an act of reconciliation, arriving at answers that seek not to bridge impossible physical and cultural gaps, but to guide one as they navigate the journey between them."
It's a thought-provoking film.
"There's the overall feeling of hard work not quite paying off, but the gorgeous and game Chastain quietly salvages everything she can."
There are so many delightful little touches and warped bits of storytelling that I can't imagine anyone who won't love this film.
"There are questionable plot hooks and discordant character changes aplenty, but all is well thanks to a buoyant song score and flawless performances from all involved."
"The cast is terrific. Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman and Tony Shalhoub are familiar faces, and look so out of their depth in the middle of all this silliness that of course we find ourselves smirking."
Brigsby Bear will reaffirm your belief in the positive powers of imagination.
A solid Christmas-themed dysfunctional family drama is enlivened by its superior cast of fine Latino stars.
"It's a very tasteful heart-tugger - a drama of disarmingly level-headed empathy that glides along with wit, assurance, and grace, and has something touching and resonant to say about the current climate of American bullying."
Beneath the viscera and grue is a tender and affecting tale of first love and discovery&#46; It&#8217;s as elegant as carnal and carnivorous&#44; and it&#8217;ll take a bite out of your heart if you let it&#46;
"Talk to Her is a sad falsetto ballad, holding onto hope like a dove cupped in two gentle hands in the midst of blood-splattered bullhorns and slow death."
"It's a crazy amount of ground to cover, but only rarely does 13th sacrifice clarity for cinematic energy."
"A hard-hitting film, The Nightingale never quite reaches the heights its aiming for."
"Genuinely inspirational on many levels, this film was a surprisingly emotional ride on and off the track with another pitch-perfect outing from our national treasure Sam Neill."
THIS is the good version of the crime saga.
"The camera in The Bike Thief stays focused on the grim geography of working class life, its narrow confines and regimented rhythms."
Nuanced performances by the non-professional cast and a haunting soundtrack help fill in the deliberate narrative gaps.
"A doozy of twists and turns moving from elation to heartbreak to the dark corner of existential dread, Wardle's film works best if you know nothing."
"Fauci has an actual structural focus that's smartly considered and interesting, even if it left me with myriad questions."
Sean Penn does a great job.
"Equal parts sultry, humorous, and heartbreaking, Hustlers brings a needed female perspective to an industry poorly portrayed by Hollywood. Constance Wu and Jennifer Lopez are a lock for Oscar nominations."
An impressive action sequel that stays away from everything other than pure escapism&#46; And that&apos;s great&#33;
"Red Penguins is a wild and crazy story well told, especially in the first half, by Polsky, who is emerging as a gifted documentarian."
Matteo Garrone's stunning intertwining trilogy of macabre and peculiar fairy tales is brought to breathtaking life by a precise and painterly hand.
Sundown does lure one in and then keeps the audience on edge with a tight grasp all throughout the film's 83 minutes runtime.
"What Men Want won't let viewers have it all, but what we get is more than satisfying."
A hilarious comedy from the 80s that holds up
The comedic mayhem and sticky gloop return for another anthology chapter that proves just how good bedfellows horror and humour can make&#46; 
Clever but manipulative.
"If you can get past the film's few potholes, it has the power to really make you squirm."
"[An] intelligent, thought-provoking political drama. Underpinning it all is classy filmmaking from Jason Reitman...who gets a fine ensemble cast moving to the same beat."
Google my words: it's a winner. It may not be as great as Wedding Crashers but this re-teaming of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson was worth the 8-year wait.
"A mesmerizing, artistic and highly entertaining piece of work from one of our foremost filmakers."
"Incredibly satisfying, because it feels like every moment in the first chapter eventually does pay off, some in quite emotional ways."
At times doesn&apos;t feel like it knows where it needs to lead into&#46; The director pulls some great shorts and transitions&#44; the cast plays to their respective roles well&#46; But as the story progresses it feels all over the place &amp; some themes just aren&apos;t touched
Inglourious Basterds is Quentin Tarantino's Crash.
Meshkini communicates a personal vision in terms all women (and certainly many men) can feel deeply.

The redeeming elements and themes of In the Land of Lost Angels do not make up for the lack of original storyline.
You're unlikely to find a more droll look at obsession and lunacy than Deerskin
"Sibling writer-directors Jay and Mark Duplass have figured out how to use their meager resources to intriguing effect. After watching ""Baghead,"" I'm not sure if I've seen a horror film or a comedy, and I'm sure that's what the Duplass brothers intended."
"Scott manages to fill in the finer brushstrokes of all those characters and still fit the kind of bravura action set pieces he's known for; the fight scenes are breathlessly, bone-crunchingly brutal."
"This is a dizzyingly inventive, postmodernist exercise in breaking down cinema's 'fourth wall', Keaton playing with the possibilities of the medium and cramming an unbelievable quantity of gags and ideas into the film."
The Wind Rises undoubtedly stands out as a film with an incredible amount of passion and inspiration behind it&#44; bringing to life a story that stays with audiences and engages them on a deeply personal level&#46; 
The filmmakers aren't championing ignorance... Those on insisting on seeing this as taking sides in the 'debate' over evolution are missing the point.
This is one of the funniest things I've ever seen!

Filled to the brim with colorful characters and startling imagery.
"Death in Venice occasionally suffers from Visconti's artistic overindulgence, but the film's strengths are also paradoxically tied up in its helmer's unwavering eye for detail."
"Despite flaws (it's overlong and too theatrical, betraying its stage origins), this stylishly made cat-and-mouse thriller with strong social class overtones boasts great performances from Olivier and Michael Caine."
"What makes this such a moving family drama are the complicated characters that this talent cast creates, and the relationships between them it so effectively explores."
Anyone with a weakness for song-and-dance dementia on the level of Forbidden Zone and Cannibal! The Musical will find all this irresistible.
"This comedy of a boy and his talking bear - which plays like a long episode of ""Family Guy"" - is basically like watching Seth MacFarlane and Mark Wahlberg hanging out. Happily they're both pretty funny."
Amusing documentary duel at the video arcade.
"Strange and a little awkward, ""Secret Window"" nonetheless is worth a look."
"When a movie is written and filmed as part of the writer-actor's effort to save his own life and slim down, the movie feels, to a certain extent, critic-proof."
"Se acerta ao trazer um Bond mais amadurecido, amargurado e auto-consciente, peca terrivelmente por elementos que beiram o trash, como alguns efeitos visuais pavorosos e uma atuao sensual, mas absurda, de Janssen."
"The story is programmatic and the indie stylings feel tired but Handsome Devil is a winning, enjoyable call for individuality."
"Shyamalan demonstrates a mastery over the form of the mean and lean psycho-thriller, aided in no small party by the performances of McAvoy, Taylor-Joy and Buckley, and smooth-yet-unsettling camera work by cinematographer Michael Gioulakis."
This haunting coming-of-age film is set in a country that itself is coming of age.
"It's one of those films where you feel the authority right away: This movie knows its characters, knows its story, and knows exactly how it wants to tell us about them."
Adapted brilliantly and faithfully from the surprise best-selling novel by Judith Guest.
"We're just pleased to have a family film in the truest sense of the word, one that's genuinely hilarious, touching and inventive to both kids and their parents"
"Geek or not, a great movie experience should not be missed. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is one such experience."
"The 1962 version, starring Emmanuelle (Amour) Riva, is superior."
The delight and the exasperation of Eureka come from the same source: its willingness to take its time and explore every detour.
"Although it is briskly directed and enjoyably stylized, the film is shallow."
Takes the risk of losing its audience by interweaving four different storylines.
"This is finally a film that is better at mood than substance, that has its strongest hold on you when it's making the least amount of sense."
"Leave No Trace is a slow burn, and carefully constructed; the performances are measured and calm. There's no need to overplay the drama - the circumstances presented here are serious enough as they are."
"One of the great crime thrillers, the benchmark all succeeding heist films have been measured against, it's no musty museum piece but a driving, compelling piece of work, redolent of the air of human frailty and fatalistic doom."
"It's certainly a Spike Lee film, but no Spike Lee Joint. Still, he's delivered a pacy, vigorous and frequently masterful take on a well-worn genre."
Jeong sensitively gives her film an underlying sadness as the young women cope with the changes in their lives
"Darkly dazzling but, because of intense, sometimes terrifying imagery, it should be PG-13, not PG."
"Had this historical drama really relied on the strength of its convictions, George Clooney's good old fashioned movie might have flowed better."
A deliciously bitter pill from the Coen brothers
"Michael Apted's 'self defense isn't murder' thriller may reek of familiarity like yesterday's garbage, but the intense chemistry between the leading actors actually makes the film work."
"Mary Poppins Returns is at its best when it gives way to the unbridled, and unselfconscious sincerity that a tale like this demands."
Its ability to take audiences to a completely different land and time may remind them of how they felt when they saw Star Wars or The Wizard of Oz for the first time.
"Smart, sardonic and more than a little silly, Iron Man is a successful super-hero movie that never takes itself too seriously."
"Blowin Up is ultimately a film more about the need for a better system than a perfect solution. But with its generous, devoted attention to the people working on that solution, it is a work full of hope."
"The ingredients here could lend themselves to a full throttle chiller but Sheerin reins them in, focusing on the emotional journeys of the four central characters."
"No matter how slack the storytelling can get, the animation conveying that storytelling is borderline miraculous."
"In his debut film, Lucio Castro... explores with notable subtleties the tensions between desire, fears, and the time that never comes back. [Full Review in Spanish]"
No other version of Peter Pan has ever been as richly evocative of the lovely book illustrations of the Victorian era.
We shouldn't underestimate the opportunity the film faces: to be a feminist rescue mission.
"Everything about ""At the Heart of Gold: Inside the USA Gymnastics Scandal"" suggests someone coming toward you with a spoonful of particularly ghastly medicine. But the benefits outweigh the few unsavory side effects of this largely first-rate documentary."
"Broly sets up what could be the next phase of this Super era. If you've ever in your life loved anime and especially if you've watched Dragon Ball, go see this movie while it's in theaters and enjoy yourself as much as Goku enjoys fighting."
It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
"The special effects are more of the psychological nature, with nothing evil shown clearly but its presence always pervading."
"Anchored by Owen and Kidman, and delivered with a larger than expected scope by Kaufman... Hemingway & Gellhorn may not be literary, but it's a satisfying accomplishment."
"The Original Kings of Comedy is all about truth -- about love, family, work and life."
Suitably giddy with its horror-movie platitudes aimed at mocking the facade of suburban hysteria...this thriller thrives with the right amount of scrappy charm and intrigue.
"When more film lovers discover the visual beauty of this film and continue to be haunted by its imagery, Majidi's films will surely receive more screenings in the states"
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is exactly what you'd expect from Guy Ritchie: a frenetically paced affair peppered with humour and plenty of laddish behaviour.
"As sober as a lab report, the excellent documentary metes out its findings with calm precision."
Hair High is the actually the artist's most cohesive 'story' to date...which means it's only about 35% weirder than any other sort of animation out there.
"This blue-collar ""Ocean's Eleven"" is a smooth-running, pleasantly familiar crime caper. In a movie full of cons, the greatest may be how deceptively easy Steven Soderbergh makes the whole enterprise seem."
"...basically just sits there for a good long hour before it picks up any sensible speed. Is it all worth it, though? In ways."
[An] interesting exercise in style. [Full review in Spanish]
"The contrast between two very different characters who get along so well, is what makes ""Cha Cha Real Smooth"" an extremely charming experience. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Finds Soderbergh keeping it simple, stupid, by filling the story's hollowness with kick-butt action and elements of style."
"The script's snazzy dialogue establishes a realistic atmosphere that involves us in the unfolding crisis, but the lazy plotting ensures that little of our emotional investment pays off."
"Throughout Paolo Sorrentino's film, the line between miracle and cosmic prank, even tragedy, is rendered indistinguishable."
A documentary that mixes advocacy journalism with the suspenseful thrill of a caper.
More than anything&#44; this documentary is a celebration of Blades the Musician&#46; His talent and contribution to the genre of salsa cannot be underestimated&#46;
"Right now, this gleefully reckless adult comedy gets the job done in ways many new-release movies this year have failed to do."
"They call documentary which is actually a propaganda piece, never trying to question Walter's figure but rather falling all over his mysticism, for which I honestly can't blame them either. [Full review in Spanish]"
Nothing about this film feels remotely safe.
"Unlikely premise, yet script offers dialogue, heart-tugs, actual intelligent thought and a fair and necessary reflection on the State elections in the Union. A pleasant film."
"Cooper is superb, hard as granite, dense as an imploding black hole."
"Overall it's smart entertainment that even manages to make Robert De Niro, Cooper's co-star, sound fully engaged."
"Chris Sanders and Dean Deblois have crafted such a smart and sassy tale, it would have been solid even if the central characters were stick figures."
"Knowledge is power, but in Everybody Knows, nobody's quite certain about the whole truth."
"Regardless of whether you recognize the names of Christopher Isherwood or Don Bachardy, this masterful documentary draws you into the men's lives like a star-studded bedtime tale."
"While Caught won't abduct everyone's attention, it's a strange, unique, and intense indie that will be welcomed by both sci-fi and horror fans alike."
"Take it for what it is: An old guy who gives himself one last juicy role as the flawed, haunted anti-hero, an old guy who's done this so often that he isn't above making himself look silly as well as heroic (he even croons the title song over the ending c"
"It's a slow effort, painfully so at times, but the reward is a sharp psychological study that ends up being the most interesting conflict in the movie."
Boogie Nights for Gen Z...
"Parts of the film are frustrating, and downright suspenseful, because Marija earns our respect while no one else gives her any. Thanks to Jaktait&#279;'s bracing performance, we know she also internalizes this hard-earned truth."
"Very violent, mostly in comic-book terms."
The cast ... manages to give thoughtful performances that salvage the film's integrity.
"The Fly seizes on our ingrained, instinctive horror of sexuality, the sense of shame that our fundamentally puritanical society can't help but teach us, and by confirming our worst fears, helps us, for a moment, to move beyond them."
"Ghosts of the Ozarks is not groundbreaking or ushering a new kind of terror, but it does have an impressive premise, worthy of appreciation in the wealth of knowledge of the genre, making it an independent horror film worthy enough to seek out."
"Melissa McCarthy gives the performance of her career and Richard E. Grant is terrific. Director Marielle Heller has a keen eye for detail from the bookshops to the bars, the film is bathed in authenticity."
"Although imperfect, it's engaging, thought-provoking stuff."
"The lean story-telling works well for its taciturn characters and spare settings, presented by cinematographer Amundsen, and well scored with assistance from Mastodon."
The Forever Purge is another powerfully political piece of action horror art from the hit franchise&#44; drawing on our current social strife for its scares&#46;
"All the participants are earnest, some a bit quirky, but Stephenson allows us to judge them for ourselves as this amusing, low-key suspense yarn unfolds"
The strong conclusion ensures that the film ends on a somewhat powerful note...
A classic gets even better.
"In some ways, Coppola improves on the original film, but at the very least the different actors make for a different dynamic."
"Room 237 is a fascinating study of what fans of the film believe, and it's an entertaining look at that world-especially if you're not immersed it in it everyday."
"It's hard to resist a satire, even when it wobbles, that insists the most unbelievable parts are the most true."
Close to an XL for me. It's a sequel that uses a rehash of storylines and characters that still actually held up.
"I'd rank being stuck in a big quiet house at night as one of life's most easily unnerving experiences, and this movie capitalizes on it."
No franchise like Scream has to constantly reinvent itself with meta narratives while also keeping direct connections to its original installments&#46; Scream VI is a mean&#44; nasty&#44; rollicking good time at the movies&#44; just as Wes Craven always intended&#46;
"It may not make total sense, but Déjà vu is a highly enjoyable, superbly made thriller. Like me, you may want to see it again"
A well made&#44; heavy film about real-world problems&#44; thought at times obstructed by the framework of its setting to make a greater point&#46;
"A slow, methodical, carefully researched look at traveling the Oregon trail before stagecoaches became extinct."
A unique and exotic work of art that strikes a universal chord.
"Brilliantly crafted documentary about Hollywood legend Robert Evans may not be the unvarnished truth, but it is great, glossy fun."
"Despite these frustrating moments where The Witches of the Orient feels designed for a different audience, one which doesn't need to either race to catch up or be calmed into tranquility, the story of the Japanese volleyball team is undeniably remarkable."
"Captures a raw and honest look at the feeling of being trapped in a life you never asked for, wanting so desperately to get yourself out of it, but realizing that you're probably stuck there for good."
"A clever, enjoyable movie, with enough thrills and laughs to keep all ages entertained!"
"As freewheeling and irreverent as the man himself, Saint Misbehavin' is that rare documentary whose flaws seem appropriate for its subject matter."
a wickedly funny and stylish take on a childrens classic that conjures family fun with a typically dark Roald Dahl edge. 
"A collage of emotions, shifting through scenes that are happy, silly, angry, sexy, even sad."
I seriously love this movie.
"A naturalistic, chat-heavy narrative that captures the difficulties wrought by the unimaginable trauma individuals face as they attempt to forge connections and find peace after war."
"An increasingly rich and accomplished comic still works for his laughs, with edge, antic energy and polished stage patter."
"""Spider-Man: Far from Home"" isn't really a superhero movie. It's a wholesome teen comedy disguised as a superhero movie."
This all-too-familiar gloom and doom tale is depressing and feels longer than the 104-minute running time. The acting is top drawer from the powerhouse cast of respected thespians.
"Deftly written by Richard Curtis and directed by the versatile Mike Newell, Four Weddings is as good as its word, breezily following a small circle of friends through every one of the events the title promises."
There are still good vampire movies being made. Like this one.
"At its core, watchable."
The Second Coming on a trash heap.
A moving documentary for the ages and a reminder of Gilda Radner's greatness both as a comic and as a human being.
A story that tries and often succeeds in transcending its particulars for a story about the personal and political struggle to come of age.
"Between an elegant ""pas de deux"" and a simple, as well as painful, sprain. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Technically, Scott has consistently demonstrated that he ranks among the best popular film artists. Unfortunately, Scott's film doesn't work for me as well in other areas."
This place is less crossroads of the world than land of confusion.
"The impact of Peter Jackson's King Kong is as massive as the gigantic gorilla itself, a spectacle to marvel at, but most importantly, a story with which we can connect emotionally."
"The story, about a young soldier who is torn between leaving the army and loyalty to his brothers at arms, is affecting and well acted ..."
"The microcosm Delmer Daves creates here would make Billy Wilder pause, and the final five minutes are a masterstroke of nihilism."
Zombieland&#58; Double Tap is perfect for fans of the original&#44; especially in keeping its focus squarely on original characters but the film isn&apos;t perfect overall and it&apos;s hard to say it will pull in new fans&#46;
The scenery is beautiful and it is a fun ride along with Emily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson but it is no African Queen.
Probably the most visually dazzling film Pixar has ever made.
The irresistibly wicked humor of this film is firmly rooted in despair. We can all relate.
The movie somehow finds something new and meaningful to say about art and life and the region of shades between the two. 
"Plays out with frightening, gripping logic, each new step and new realization suddenly appearing like a cold sweat."
"A pastoral romance based on an earlier version of Lawrence's novel that is softer and can stand on its own terms, despite lacking the class distinctions that would distinguish the final version."
"When I think what sentimental tripe The Queen could have been in the hands of amateurs, I bow in gratitude to all concerned."
It takes only a glance at Julie Ledru&#44; the star of &#8220;Rodeo&#44;&#8221; to convince you to go for the ride of Lola Quiveron&#8217;s ferocious feature debut&#46;
"Though it never hits action movie nirvana, if you can get past the intentionally OTT gross-out factor, Repo Men is a serviceable and entertaining sci-fi yarn."
It may move you to tears -- you'll also bust a gut laughing at his dialogue-recording scenes from Aladdin and stage-show improvs -- but this important documentary about the last days of actor Robin Williams is must viewing.
"Wonder Woman ends with a sequel on the horizon, that will certainly get made if the movie inspires little girls to ditch their Disney Princess regalia and learn to scare off creeps with the raise of an eyebrow, the Gal Gadot way."
"It's a fascinating bundle of contradictions--authentic in a million details, deeply romanticized in others. Cool, calm and collected, this is more love story than gangster picture."
"It's a pleasure to see a movie about people in their 50s, assessing their lives as they deal with the long farewell of a parent."
"In its broad strokes, Glory gets at the spirit of a group of previously unsung black heroes, and the filmmaking is of a high caliber. [Blu-ray]"
"For journalists and people who care about democracy and the value of open society, Spotlight is a master class on how things should be done."
"It's pure-strain Bong all the way through, surprising and unsubtle in all his appealing glory."
"A slow-building, well-done, rather melancholic film, Mountain treats the life of an Orthodox Jewish woman, Tzvia, whose family lives in a dwelling adjacent to the Mount of Olives cemetery in Jerusalem."
"The film is a meticulously, perhaps even cynically crafted crowd-pleaser. Even those alive to its tactics might find themselves wiping away a tear or two."
"I can't say the found-footage format of Chronicle was particularly impressive, but the rest of the film is a minor revelation."
"By tying it back to characters that don't seem popped from any too-familiar mold, the film allows its sense of regret, its alarm at time passing, to feel earned."
"Black Widow isn't the best MCU movie. It's not really in the top tier, really. And it doesn't offer as many broader connections as we might like. But as far as popcorn-munching action-packed cinematic adventures go, you could do a lot worse."
"Though the subject matter could've been developed into a more challenging and provocative yarn, this film's chief aim is escapism."
Pollack does right to put his faith in one man and a whole lot of mountains. The result is impressive.
"We've all stared up into the dark, knowing we can't really conceive of what we're looking at."
"This sprawling portrait of the Red Army Faction... is neither an apologetic for the anarchist gang nor a condemnation of it, but rather a fascinating exploration of the shift in the zeitgeist of that era..."
The pole position in the race for the next Best Animated Feature Oscar has clearly been staked out.
"A total celebration of theatre, history and politics."
"In this summer of raunchy, hilarious R-rated comedies, Virgin fits right in--even if the one-joke premise gets a little stale towards the end."
"A crime of cinematic passion, a daring attempt at replicating a famed artist's visionary style in animated form, and a somewhat plodding detective story told in wheezy old narrative tropes that violate an often ravishing technique."
"Deadwyler gives a career-making performance as Mamie, perfectly poised between grief and strength. The film, which is dedicated to Mamie, ultimately belongs to her."
"Martin Scorsese's dbut feature has just the slightest bit of story line, but the movie is a fascinating portfolio piece: a black-and-white blueprint for ""Mean Streets."""
Mostly enjoyable and only slightly too long.
A clever blend of psychological thrills and stalked-by-monster terror is what makes writer-director Neil Marshall's sophomore effort a cut above most horror films.
"MacIntyre and Chris Lee Hill's screenplay is rife with absurdity, glorious carnage, jet-black humor - and best of all, a solid relationship at its core."
"""Last Christmas"" is that film that fits neatly between spasms of holiday shopping, when you want to just get away from the mall madness for a couple of hours."
"Fern hits the road in her mobile home initially to pick up work in a gargantuan Amazon warehouse, a symbol of 21st-century postmodernity as dehumanising as any 19th-century cotton mill or factory."
Romeo Must Die scores when it concentrates on Li's fast footwork and flying fists.
Sends chills down your spine.
"More daydream than nightmare, The Craft: Legacy delivers an enchanting outing that honors its origins while maintaining the ease and self-awareness characteristic of a timelessly great scary movie."
It's as hilarious as you can imagine. [Full Review in Spanish]

"A likeable family movie in the Paddington mould, though not as charming or well made."
"Ms. Vreeland has paced her documentary well, a chapter to each era, with hundreds of beautiful images spanning decades of artists, galleries, parties, scenes."
"With lush visuals, a strong star turn from Dev Patel and some thoughtful ruminations on Hollywood heroism and masculinity, David Lowery' 'The Green Knight' is about as good as you hoped."
What's so lovely here is Manuel's warmth and humanity - the way he lives with regrets and disappointment.
The minute you hear the Downton Abbey theme it's like coming back home. Director Julian Fellowes out did himself with a marvelous transfer of the beloved series without skipping a beat on its essence. Maggie Smith's quick wit is absolutely fantabulous
"What's amazing is the mixture of willpower and uncertainty, mendacity and credulity, gracefulness and self-conscious posing that [DiCaprio] conveys, even before you see him speak."
"Paced with the deliberate restraint and discipline of a seasoned poker player, the film is clinical and unflinching in its execution, its impact incremental yet lingering."

The only thing that I know for sure has ended with the Marvel Cinematic Universe is my patience.
"Matt Reeves delivers a standout Batman movie. It's a dark, alluring mystery that digs deep into Bruce Wayne's trauma, how it's shaped him and how he's choosing to move forward."
"There has been a lot of backlash by those accusing the boxer of lying, but that is not the point of this Tyson-Toback collaboration. It is Tyson's story, truth or not, from his viewpoint and that is what we get."

It's a high concept structure built with a lo-fi aesthetic that's populated by darkly comic performances lending a surreal dryness that captivates as the whole spirals out.

Baby-faced Renner is eerily convincing as this bland blank of a man with unimaginable demons within.

"With a strut to its walk and a lilt to its talk, and a crafty bit of whimsy up its sleeve, ""Hear My Song"" is a gloriously loony and exhilaratingly romantic comedy."

"With genius executive producer John Lasseter's stamp of approval on ""Finding Dory"", what's not to like?"
"Scream feels familiar, but it's unafraid of criticizing its existence while providing commentary on the new wave of horror and toxicity in fandom."
Any damage such revisionist history may impose on young minds is offset by the honestly inspiring thoughts Pocahontas offers.

Plenty for fans to chew over and enjoy. Non-fans should steer well clear.

"Director Kornél Mundruczó doesn't go easy on his actors or on us, making this an ordeal."
...Colette is a film that is appropriate for this new era following the start of the Times Up movement.

Any A- or B- list actress would jump at the chance to work with the [screenwriters].
"Although it brings nothing new to the con-artist fold, or even anything thrilling, ""Focus"" is a seductive enough rehash that benefits from the built-in pleasures of the trade."
"...one of the most entertaining, laugh-out-loud funny, and unexpectedly touching efforts to come around in quite some time..."
"Regardless of its flimsy emotional interior, Ricki is a worthy addition in this year's growing canon of strong female-centred films, and it would be wise to remember Streep's stunning performance come awards season."
"The leisurely, indifferent pace of the film is probably why it is rated so poorly among young viewers ... It does have its rewards."
Colin Farrell is a super freaky vampire.
"Thompson's performance is compulsively fun, the actor relishing the bone-dry put-downs of a memorably serrated character."

"Director Dexter Fletcher paints Eddie's story in broad, bold strokes, never missing an opportunity to milk a suspenseful dramatic turn or go for the relatively easy laugh -- but it's a style well-suited to this wonderfully ridiculous story."
"It's bold, captivating cinema, with a soundtrack that threatens to never leave your head."
"In Nighy, the witty script leaps to life, in a tour-de-force of darkly downbeat comedic timing..."

It will be a hard heart indeed that won't be affected by the way the story is resolved.
"Asking audiences to sympathize with Fox News anchors is quite the hurdle, but this film is the best #MeToo film to date and a must see."
"Auto Focus is not your standard Hollywood bio-pic. Schrader aims to present an unflinching look at one man's downfall, brought about by his lack of self-awareness."
Topics that could make a sailor blush - but lots of laughs.
"This is the Fritz Lang method: pose a question, then answer it, though never in any sort of predictable rhythm."
"Standout performances by Tandy and Freeman, plus strong support from Dan Aykroyd. It's quaint and comfortable."
"Bernadette is a vibrant creative spirit, and Blanchett blithely gives the character her all."

Eternals is messy but there is beauty in its parts if not necessarily the sum.
"By approaching Marshall as just another idealistic young trial lawyer, the film stands on its own as a compelling courtroom drama, complete with surprising revelations ..."

"It won't blow you away, but it remains a well-played and solidly entertaining family film."
"The story is good enough to tell itself, and the filmmakers should have let it."

"The Hunt for Planet B delivers a captivating viewing experience, showing the sometimes-thin line between science fiction and the true scientific future."
"The Tomorrow War provided all the alien action I wanted, but it also provided a large amount of emotion I wasn't expecting. I went in excited for the film, and it exceeded all my expectations."

Witherspoon abnd Kutcher show terrific chemistry...
An instant horror classic - and quite possibly the scariest film of the decade.

"Serra self-consciously removes his film from the assaultive world of media. Its slow pace and dark, lush setting require attention but also a forgetting or abandonment of the world outside."

"The Garden is a film of many moods, alternately peaceful and disturbing, ethereal and familiar, but as with many of Jarman's films, it is also often frustratingly abstract, cryptically symbolic and resolutely self-referential."
"Avoiding the safety of the PC blanket, David O. Russell has crafted a canny, crafty and altogether adorable little misfit of a movie."
"Somehow, among the clichs and familiar story lines, the actors rise above the muck and make a movie that's entertaining to watch."
"Still only 27 years old, Lawrence has every chance of a fifth Academy award nomination and a possible second statuette for this phenomenal and punishing performance."

It is not then for anyone looking for a fun night out - but it is a beautifully crafted and acted indictment of how modern economic practice is destroying people.
I admire this. Claire Denis is still directing thoughtful sci-fi.
It's a social and political commentary of a modern day industrial power and the polarisation and inequality prevalent in most developing nations.
Phoenix's performance overwhelms the slight story.
"Lighter and loopier than Bogdanovich's key '70s pics and naughtier and rather more cynical than his woofy What's Up, Doc?, She's Funny That Way is certainly amusing for the first and second acts."
"With its jittery stop-motion animation, exquisitely detailed shots, and outwardly self-aware characters,[it's] the epitome of artifice. It's also as bright and cheery a time as you'll have at the movies this year."
A powerful and atmospheric film that delivers a barrage of images and concepts of both sexual and philosophical natures.

"Like another Australian musical by a then young director, Gillian Armstrong's Starstruck from 1982, Bran Nue Dae carries the day with energy and self-belief."
City of Men does not have that piercing naturalistic horror and drive of its predecessor. But it stands on its own as a chronicle of enduring friendship in impossibly horrid circumstances.

"When 2014 Godzilla finally fully emerges from the deep like a gloriously meaty centerfold straight out of Bulk Reptile magazine -- a creation that's part performance capture, part computer stuff, thankfully looking nothing like a CG cartoon -- we cheer."
"The film overextends itself a little as twist piles upon twist and in terms of narrative it's not entirely successful, but as a masterclass in microbudget film-making this is well worth a look."
A touching film that perhaps spends a bit too much time digging in the wrong places.
Sexy and wry.
In short&#44; it&apos;s hard to take any of this seriously or care very deeply&#44; but it&apos;s equally hard to deny that some fun -- guilty perhaps -- is had in the process&#46;

"Durham is a decent enough way to pass away a few hours on a weekend, especially if you love the game, but it ain't gonna change your life."

"It's a film that deserves to be seen, be discussed and win awards."
"Normally I'm not averse to time-shifting in movies, but in this case I found the device unhelpful. Individual scenes are superbly staged and the cast is flawless, making the film essential viewing for lovers of the book."
"Dujardin keeps Georges innocent, almost paternally daffy, as he shuffles toward madness..."
"Look beyond all the staple elements of Disney animations and you'll see two strong, complicated female characters. Those seem hard to come by even in live-action films."

A savage&#44; savvy and scathingly amusing satire about coveting &#36;1250-a-head meals but letting the workers behind them slice&#44; steam&#44; stir and sweat through upscale kitchen drudgery&#46;
A tribute to how entrenched the Rugrats are in our hearts.

"Stirring film, capable of moving you even as it gives you a new perspective from the past on an issue that continues to plague us, here in the future."
"Rock's script isn't afraid to get raunchy, sometimes a little too much, but there is a bit of heart at the center. Dawson and Rock have the chemistry to make it work, even when it feels a little contrived."
"Up until the last 20 or so minutes, Split is a tense, tightly directed thriller that would probably have ended up among my favorite movies at the end of the year."
"Hilarious, fast, funny, fresh fun for the family."

This is a movie with bruised shins and a huge heart.
"In some ways, this is Art House 101 stuff -- the kind of movie you just know is good for you, because it's so dull and depressing.That, however, is merely one aspect of it."
"You can feel your brain melting away as you watch it, and that's not always a bad sensation."
"The director introduces an interesting framing device, interviewing his main characters dressed in plain clothes and facing a camera, the full significance of this reality-show type setup only becoming apparent at the end of the film."

"It's said that great British actors will do anything for money. This is the case with Ben Kingsley, who gives a great performance in a rather sucky serial killer thriller."
Wonderfully immersive film into the emotional lives of two vulnerable teen-agers in love as they move forward in their tenuous relationship.

"It's creatively authentic, and its creators are also its subject."
"Obscuro Barroco privileges other ways of knowing: a material engagement with the world that neither fixes nor categorises, but makes space for new becomings."
"Offsetting the chilly voyeurism is a viable teen romance and an appealing sense of humor. Though there are occasional lapses in logic, Disturbia is consistently suspenseful and entertainingly disturbing."
"The heartfelt, personal Microbe & Gasoline may be Gondry's best work since the still incredible Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind."
"The truth is, the DC Justice League version of Captain Marvel is a lot of fun, mostly family friendly (except for a monster biting off a guy's head), and just a tad too long to earn an extra 50 cents in yours truly's money-tinged ratings system."
"[Quentin Tarantino has] whacked history over the head and cut away all the boring bits, leaving behind a blood-drenched war epic like no other."
"A challenging and topical consideration of the queer experience, filtered through a racialized 90s lens. Bowyer-Chapman is great and while Spiral doesn't have the supportive gay relationship some viewers want, it's still valuable LGBT representation"

"This is a compelling drama, with some interesting characters. It is a story worth telling and movie worth seeing, because this could happen anywhere. I am surprised it hasn't happened in more places, especially in the United States."

Bardem gives what might have been too slow and plodding a movie its heart and its humor.
"Paul Giamatti seems to crawl into Harvey Pekar's skin. While not resembling Pekar physically, he's got that curmudgeonly attitude down pat."
"Pleasant enough--and certainly pretty enough--to serve: a lesser Pixar effort, but one that most viewers, young and old, will enjoy if not be transported by."
Super 8 is the cinematic equivalent of unearthing a time capsule and finding everything inside is still impossibly shiny and new.
TRON: Legacy may be the best movie I've ever seen that possesses a truly awful script.

It&#8217;s easy to see why many love this picture but just as easy to see why many despise it&#46;
"Most films dealing with illness and carer relationships follow the same emotional paths and miss the same points. This film, by contrast, feels fresh and real even to those of us who have been there."
"A pure comic delight: handsome, smart, quick and, blessedly, building as it progresses to climax in some truly hilarious gags."
"The movie is by turns a historic document, a milestone of queer filmmaking..."
"Schorr's delightfully deadpan comedy debut blew away the German box office, and once you let yourself sink into its gentle rhythms ... you'll see why."
"Possessor is cold, nasty, brutal, extreme and provocative."
"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever succeeds as a new adventure, and as a tribute to a wonderful actor who was taken from this world decades too soon."

"This affectionate documentary is one for the fans, but there are more of them than ever after Staples revived her career with the help of the Wilco frontman Jeff Tweedy."

There are many characters in this ensemble and the film provides much insight by looking at the situation through all of their eyes.
"Alex Kurtzman, in his directorial debut, delivers a compelling and emotional dramedy about a man who discovers he has a sister he knew nothing about."
"Kim Horton skillfully weaves together clips from past films - the participants' lives inside a fishbowl literally flashing before our eyes - and both Apted's narration and his gently needling, off-camera interrogations give you all the context you need."
"Though predictable and often preposterous, this warm and funny wish-fulfilling fantasy is a richly rewarding ride."

"A whirlwind comedy of absurdist humour, zany happenstance and good old slapstick."
"Mr. Basset is too enamored of the usual action film clichs ... But he has a graphic visual style that suits the simplistic material and he keeps you watching even as the wet, sucking sounds of skewered flesh grows tedious."
The subject&apos;s thoughts count more than the plot&#46;
"A tantalising, sometimes frustrating parable about the menaces that human beings might face from unexpected quarters."
"Fresh feminist horror of a very welcome taboo-smashing kind. Nasty, hilarious, outraged and outrageous, and as poignant as it is blackly funny."
"Director Cathy Yan (Dead Pigs, 2018) knows how to use the broken character as a narrative tool very well, and finally, gives Harley Quinn the movie she deserves. [Full review in Spanish]"

The Cooler is Leaving Las Vegas recast as a fairy tale of sorts.

"The film is a fiercely original, bold and riveting meditation on the future of the silver screen and the stars that make it shine."
"The sleeper hit of the year, a rocket out of Sundance trailing Oscar nominations for Hawkes and Hunt and, with luck, writer-director Lewin."
"Even with too much focus on the former character, Frank & Lola, buoyed by Shannon's performance and Ross' acute eye for the seediness of his environments, is a commendable debut."
"Sticklers for plot and character work will find themselves frustrated, but for those simply looking to enjoy tacos and bloodletting with a fun group of maniacs, Birds of Prey scratches that itch and then some."
Touches are just enough to earn The Good Shepherd a third star. But De Niro might want to stick to acting in future.

A lovable masterpiece replete with oddity and imagination.

"Well-crafted, magnificently-acted, and ultimately philosophical."
"Andersson's movie reveals poetic ironies, surreal slapstick and melancholy truths, often all wrapped up together. The gloom gets a bit thick over the 92 minutes, but there are sequences here you will never forget."
"[The similar] 'Omar,' a recent Oscar nominee, is better directed, with assured long takes by an established talent, Hany Abu-Assad ('Paradise Now'). 'Bethlehem' has the better, cleaner script, and the best performance of the two."

"Sadly, this expert and powerfully important film likely will spawn a sequel before all of this is finally over. Look at Totally Under Control as Act I."

The meat of Kenner's story is the heroics of the Air Force technicians who risked their lives. It adds a personal touch that immensely humanizes a story that could easily get lost in the minutia.

Bud and Lou meet another monster for infrequent laughs.

"A poetic, mesmerizing fusion of fairy tale and cultural commentary from director Jessica Oreck."
"Odom, Ben-Adir, Goree and Hodge are an ensemble of strength and flair. It was a pleasure to witness so many phenoms at work simultaneously. Without hesitation, every man shined just as bright as the next."
"A vivaciously crowd-pleasing space adventure. Of all of Marvel's many Phase I and Phase II projects tackled, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is, to date, the most alive with imagination and wonder."
"[Woody Allen's] most recognizable film, the one that he is most associated with."
"Blue Jasmine is one of Allen's cleverest and most compassionate films, making it also one of his greatest."

This is an incredibly sweet - and occasionally bittersweet - tale about family and love that will move and entertain audiences...
This is one of those movies which make you want to know what happens to the characters later on.

A hilarious and often horrifying exploration of the trials of growing up.
"Sprawling, intriguing and handsomely shot, Yuma builds its gruff tension while being reminiscent of the frothy frontier flicks from yesteryear."
Rat Film somehow manages to combine the rigors of good journalism ... with a formal structure that is about as far from journalism as you can get.
But Klute feels vibrantly alive in a way that betrays its subdued chilliness.
A surprisingly fun&#44; well-written and sweeping adventure that lands most of its gags and sentiment&#44; and even thrillingly pushes the boundaries of animated action&#46;
"A surfeit of screenwriters (eight, including Billy Wilder) and directors (five, including John Huston) lends the whole a chaotic, disjointed air, but there is much fun to be had along the way."
...a decidedly middle-of-the-road Disney effort...

Try Harder succeeds with flying colors.
"[Susanne] Bier and screenwriter Anders Thomas Jensen continuously push their all too human subjects to the edge, and invite us to witness the fallout."

I don't think we'll ever come closer to understanding and experiencing what ordinary fighting men went through in this global conflict.
The movie has an innocence and charm that grow on you.
"Don't expect a Caravaggio, but if your taste turns to Hallmark, this is a good bet -- a straight-up Nativity story as safe as death and taxes."
A different kind of horror is portrayed in Capturing the Friedmans -- the disintegration of a family after the father secret life is exposed.
It is very well acted and deals with familiar material in a subtle and sensitive fashion.
"[Has moments of] delirious political comedy, and it functions as a thriller, too."
A nice little formula picture.
That is about as 'best of both worlds' as one could ask for.
"A familiar story made fresh thanks to great voice acting and dizzying, dazzling action. Parents won't hate themselves afterward."
"Pellington adeptly rewires the audience's spinal columns with startling images, nearly subliminal cuts and a nerve-jangling feeling of overarching doom."
Its two first acts are a touching and engaging experience. But the third becomes sublime thanks to a magic called Fernanda Montenegro. [Full review in Portuguese]
The fact that The Rookie is a nearly impeccable cinematic experience -- and a wonderful all-ages triumph besides -- is a miracle akin to the story the film portrays.
"A hilarious and touching Netflix original, sculpting a very New York film out of a brilliant ensemble cast."
The acting alone is worth the price of admission.
"There is an atmosphere of slow, creeping dread all throughout the film, like the anticipation of creatures around the next corner."
"Freaky zips by amusingly enough, but its concepts never quite pop like they did in Happy Death Day, nor does it push the envelope enough for a film that references the dark masterpiece that is Heathers so early on."
"Completely sober thought here, but the best concert to attend this week is [one where] the headliner is a filmmaker and automobiles are the tools of the band."
"In its cross-cultural breadth, director Ridley Scott's smart and violent film merits comparison to Steven Soderbergh's ""Traffic,"" but the dialogue delivered by the stellar cast is incomparably McCarthy's."
A tricky little beast that fits in peculiarly well with the recent trend of deconstructive horror films.
"21 times hotter, 200 times smarter than Fifty Shades of Grey."
"At least these superfriends can still crack a joke (I've never been more grateful for Anthony Mackie's light touch) and, for all its seriousness, Civil War sustains a much-needed sense of humor."
"A brilliant, absurd collection of vignettes that, in their own idiosyncratic way, sum up the strange horror of life in the new millennium."
"""The Connection"" isn't all that different from a lot of police procedurals that have come before, but there's something about this particular gritty true-crime story that still fascinates all these years later."
"Daring, delusional and downright devilish, Black Snake Moan soaks in its molasses-driven melodrama with an unctuous confidence and biting creativity."

29 Days is a reminder of why Bullock became a movie star in the first place
An extraordinary portrait of a positive and meaningful father-son relationship that touches the heart.
"If you want to give kids an updated version of this story, this works. It's fine, one of those movies that I understood why they made it, but nothing groundbreaking."
"Carax's film is a cousin to ""Synecdoche"" and a modern response to Rivette's ""Celine and Julie Go Boating."" He even appears to have anticipated Cronenberg's ""Cosmopolis,"" answering the questions set forth...as to where all the limos go at night."
Very much a film of two halves.
"With nods to Kubrick's film, this is no nostalgia trip, but more like a last stand."
A Terrence Malick movie -- only four features in 33 years -- is such a visual splurge that you feel the film and its coffee-table book have arrived in unison.
"It's wild to be saying that everything matters in the fourth movie in a series about a guy whose dog was killed by bad guys, but here we are. It's popcorn entertainment, obviously, but it's popcorn entertainment done just right."
Plaza disappears into her role&#44; resulting in a career-best performance and one of 2022&#8217;s most captivating screen characters&#46; 
Feels more like a gangster movie than a sports drama. [Full review in Spanish]
It's an improbably beautiful film about strangers on a train coming to terms with each other as they make peace with their troubled selves.
An intriguing premise matched with relaxing music to compliment Robert Redford's calm disposition. The movie lacks a thrilling or surprising climax and conclusion.
"[The Lion King] is the best remake of the Disney animated classics ... You can't top the animated movie, but this is a good alternative for a new generation and fans that want to see a 'realistic' take on what that would look like."

"The film's comedy is loose and generous, and its esprit de corps sneaks up on you with a soft tread."
"It's not Van Sant's most tightly crafted story, but it's a compassionate saga of the Sisyphean task of sobriety."
A warm bath in comfortable platitudes.
"By Pixar's lofty standards, Onward is more Monsters University (also from Scanlon) than Inside Out."
"The House of Sand and Fog is a deeply unsettling film, written, acted and directed with unflinching honesty."
"Even if the plot is full of holes, it's utterly mesmerising."
"A reasonably digestible slice of domestic drama--one that's good-hearted, but that doesn't give you excessive heartburn."
Was Die Hard 4 taken? I know that there are better minds in Hollywood than this that come up with a more appropriate and not so annoying title.
&#8220;Uncharted&#8221; really leans on its star power&#44; especially Holland who plays a very Holland-like character &#8211; charismatic&#44; boyishly charming&#44; a bit daffy&#44; and with an unshakable innocence &#40;even when he tries to talk tough&#41;&#46; 
"In Mark Of An Angel the misdirection is sometimes subtle, sometimes not so, but director Safy Nebbou in the end deserves the benefit of the doubt for just about preserving credibility when the plot goes into a wild reverse skid."
"The anarchic power and novelty of Zola's story survive the transition from tweet to screen, proving that sometimes truth really is stranger than fiction."
Sisters has a patchily funny first act but unleashes pure comedic chaos once the party gets started.
It's all far-fetched in a way that only international spy thrillers -- bless their hearts -- can be.
Sharply scripted character comedy meets shotgun siege thriller.
"Scary, tense, atmospheric, and well acted..."
Once Bill Murray enters the fold&#44; it becomes a mildly more enjoyable film&#44; but the tropes have not aged as well as Murray&#8217;s considerable&#44; understated charm&#46;
"The great achievement in writer-director Jono Oliver's poignant, superb debut, ""Home,"" lies in the balance between the film's empathy for those like Jack who seek independence and its compassion for others who may need care indefinitely."
"It just observes, as young rebel movies have since the dawn of cinema, that life is something that happens while you're busy trying to skate around it."
A raucous and fun follow up.
"Manipulative? Yes. But damn, citywide funerals, a cranked score, and some Baldwin blue steel redemption poses clears away any irksome storytelling dissatisfaction."
"If only all debut films were like this: story, style and substance."
The greatest Steven Spielberg movie since the last great one? Sure.
"Centering on a female protag (well-played by Kathleen Turner) and dealing with a similar universal fantasy of revisiting your past, Coppola's small-town fable is a wonderful companion piece to Back to the Future, which was released a year earlier."
A muddled tale of a corporate high-flying huckster brought low.
Even tweens will enjoy this road trip with Goofy.
"When Hobbs & Shaw digs into the old [Fast & Furious] trick bag, it's as good as the real thing. When it reverts to Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's brand of far-fetched action movies, it's an inferior project -- but not entirely bad."
"In place is a talented cast, an interesting director, an established lead character, and a wealth of plots from the comics ready to be mined for future storylines. Despite Iron Man's problems, it will definitely leave you wanting more."
"Though the film doesn't quite capture the extremes of athletic action, psychology, or sociology, it points at them alluringly."
Minghella fans will be happy.
Watching Jenkins and O'Hara go at it (in more ways than one) is especially terrific fun.

"The movie ever fully shakes off its air of skillfully executed experiment, but it's spirited and charming nonetheless."
"It's seriously hampered by its focus on an oddly bloodless love story, but there's enough provocative, thoughtful 2001 style material about the human identity here to salvage the movie."
"This is a crowd-pleaser that will have even the grumpiest of audience members imagine how they could better themselves, if even for a few fleeting moments."
"Perhaps does not plumb the depths of profundity that ""Coraline"" and ""ParaNorman"" did, but it's a funny, great-looking, fast-moving and delightfully likable adventure."
"A taut, wildly engrossing thriller packed with excellent performances, chief among them Jessica Chastain's as a Mossad agent."
A portrait of practical symbiosis in both domestic and emotional terms.
"A slow-burn thriller about isolation and fighting back against a cold, unforgiving world, God's Country grips you the minute it starts and never lets go until the credits roll."
"Armando Iannucci, always a sharp observer of the complex motivations that fuel political behavior, doesn't miss a beat."
"It explodes clichés, keeps you guessing, and takes advantage of the clear trust among the actors to create an unusual and compelling family dynamic."
"Depardieu and Marie Bunel (as Bellamy's wife) have a terrific interplay, but Chabrol's sharp direction can't quite rescue his fuzzy script."
"In the nicest possible way, Saint Frances is a Lifetime TV movie that has a degree in feminist literary theory."
Strictly for unreformed lovers of very French cinema and lovers of the very nostalgic.
"An astonishing, overpowering piece of rabble-rousing, consciousness-raising, epic-scale filmmaking."
"What enchants, really, is the relationship between Nick and Nora as they live an eternal cocktail hour, bewailing hangovers that only another little drink will cure, in a marvellous blend of marital familiarity and constant courtship."

"Codirectors Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini, who have three traditional documentaries on their resume, do a good job of keeping the various Harveys and Joyces from bumping into each other."
"Robert Zemeckis isn't a Hal Walker, but Joe Dante's right up there with Tashlin, Avery, and Jones."
"Execution matters. Verve, and energy, and inventiveness matter. And Monsters University is funny, fast, and likable, with occasional moments of real visual surprise and laugh-out-loud offhand gags."
"Fighting with My Family is a fun and surprising emotional story about a quirky, ambitious clan. Wrestling fans may be most drawn to it, but it still has a lot to offer even if you've never watched a match in your life."
"We know how the story closes, of course, but MacDonald tells it with verve and sensitivity..."
"It's overlong and it's message as subtle as a sledgehammer, but a great cast makes this frantic prom worth attending."
"Either as public relations or as therapy, it looks like a dodge. But as art, ""Honey Boy"" is kind of brilliant."
Jeremy Gosch's documentary about the origins of professional surfing shines a light on four wave riders -- three Australians and a South African -- who helped transform a counter-culture life style into a billion-dollar industry.
"The story is old-fashioned ... much like a Grimm fairytale, complex and with a dark edge."
"My only reservation about the movie, not a serious one but a nagging one, is that watching the film it's hard to see why the Coens wanted to make it."
This is a lively affair with treats for fans and a barrage of entertainment for all.
"A flashy Robin Hood-ish drama of female empowerment, Hustlers is recommended viewing."
"most of the chase sequences feature more jiggle than you'd get in a ""Three's Company"" marathon. As her astounding exercise regimen shows, Lara treats her body like a temple; many will worship it."
"The great thing, typically, about a Takashi Miike film is that there's no such thing as a typical Takashi Miike film."
'Are you wolf or sheep?'
"A rousing, sometimes funny, frequently depressing documentary."
"This holiday season-zom-com-song-rom-dram is a lot of fun and could weasel its way into the ""off beat"" holiday faves of those who claim Batman, Gremlins, and Die Hard as their go-to holiday flicks."
"It's more of a relationship drama, one that works as a showcase for two great performances against a post-apocalyptic backdrop that ups the stakes..."
"John Callahan's life becomes one of the most interesting recent portraits of an artist's journey. But the beauty of Van Sant's approach is that he brings it down to earth, because every life is a hard road traveled."
"It's a quasi-religious fable about a man haunted by the past and facing a profound moral and existential crisis in the present, and it's a dazzling display of virtuoso cinematic technique and showboat performances."
"""The Iron Lady"" is keenly attuned to the small indignities of a woman trying to elbow her way into a man's world."
A thoroughly great time&#33;
Baumbach perfectly captures the atmosphere of a childhood marred by emotional fisticuffs.
"Reitman may have his drawbacks but no one has ever accused his films of lacking heart. With sports movies especially, ya gotta have heart."

"Bright, concise and to the point."
A step forward for 'Thor' but not for the larger universe of which it's part. [Full review in Spanish]

"Awesome telling of Civil War battle with stellar cast, set pieces."

"[A] film so deeply unsettling, so horrifying on an almost cellular level."
"Both [stars] have radiant smiles, illuminating every moment of understanding or empathy. Their rapport warms the movie as surely as the opening scene's sun."
Recounts a short life that seemed to straddle worlds and eras&#44; and perhaps the definitive portrait will never be filmed or written&#46; Until it is&#44; though&#44; there&apos;s always the music&#46;
The great strength of A Prayer Before Dawn is its relentless physicality and lurking camera which never shies away from any of the filth of the prison.

"If you don't know by now what you're getting into when you see a movie from the Saw series, you deserve to be offended."

"Highlighted by precise performances, simmering tensions and unforgiving landscapes, this odd rarity - an arthouse western - will help broaden Reichardt's rabid but select fanbase."
"Extremely touching in its simplicity, emotional range and visual beauty, it's no wonder it became the first Indian film to achieve widespread international acclaim and establish Ray as a master filmmaker."
A striking view of a neglected generation...
"Eddie Murphy is a genius, the original is arguably the funniest movie ever made...not a bad movie, but more nostalgic than funny, a cinematic greatest hits package...surprisingly heart-felt, and the fans won't mind the films flaws..."

This high-camp film has both its finger on the pulse and an irresistibly wicked sense of humour.

It's just a stunning look at professionals doing a job most people would run from and doing it very well.

"At over two hours, the movie stills slogs its way to an unsatisfying conclusion. It's hardly a rush-hour train wreck, but it might have been more fun if it had been."

At the foundation of this movie is a great script.

"Elegant, often moving."
"In both a very literal and abstract sense, A War represents the universality of the human condition when put under extreme pressure and the lengths one is willing to go to in times of despair."
It is well-made and engages with one of the chief anxieties of modern people: What if we've been the villain all along?
"Avoids a misstep common among girl-empowerment flicks, which often emasculate the male lead to make the heroine truly heroic&#133; manages to make both leads appealing."
"Sethi's film plays along with some pretty familiar rom-com tropes. There is a definite throwback to 90's romantic comedies like ""Harry Met Sally"" but it also has a slight Bollywood-like edge that bestows it with oodles of charm."
"Nightcrawler doesn't err cautiously but on the side of discomfort, and you have to admire that."
"Arresting and heart-stopping, Number 37 is a fiercely acted and directed tale of the intense mayhem that can be born out of anger, desperation, and sheer entitlement. The buildup alone is worth the ride."
"A genre-bending story of bullying and social media, Sissy is equal parts slasher and coming-of-age film with a different type of happy ending that will leave you on the edge of your seat."
"Moronic set-ups sap the fun factor... yet, Keeping Up with the Joneses still functions because it delivers something we continue to crave on the carousel, where the Kardashians and Joneses of the world will always be on the horse ahead of ours."
"Better still, [MacDonald] has made an indubitably powerful (though not perfect) film."
Those who haven't seen it since the '70s may find themselves amazed all over again by its lyrical potency and grace; those who have never seen it may wonder how it can be that a film this great isn't shown somewhere all the time.
John Wick: Chapter 2 is one righteous MOFO of a movie.
There's a bit of a sense of Bourne style action except you can follow it.
"A bracingly cynical set-up is slightly betrayed by a treacly ending, but redeemed by the cast, especially the watchable Seyfried and MacLaine, who has the same glint in her eyes that she had in 1960 in The Apartment."
"Wilde keeps itself at a remove from its passionate, flamboyant subject, and kept me from gaining any new understanding."

This is a powerfully acted ensemble that effortlessly has conversations with one another&#46;&#46;&#46;A film whose female lens was necessary behind the camera since only other women would understand what it&#8217;s like to live in a patriarchal society
"It's one of the savviest Australian comedies in years. Which isn't to say that it isn't also incredibly stupid, because it most definitely is. And that's the entire point."
"""The Batman"" has the teeth to impress any of the opposition and eat their hearts out in the process."
"Sumptuous filmmaking at its most flashiest, ""Il Divo"" may distance some people but I found it to be riveting."

Kate Beckinsale is reason enough to go see this movie.
"Loving is a first-class actors' picnic, with the advantage of having real-life meaning in the always-thorny arena of American race relations."
"Knightley winningly portrays the arc of a fighter. Colette is ultimately a feminist tale, but never one that wallows in self-pity or seriousness. It is also carried along lightly by a script with a streak of wit ."
"It's not nearly sophisticated enough to match the complexity of its characters, whose labyrinthine romantic entanglements have a truthful ring to them."
"Journalism is all about having the courage to write the truth even if it will get you mocked by your relatives and co-workers, so here goes: Space Chimps is hilarious."

"Films don't come any huger than this: the closing chapter to an 11-year saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, told across some 22 movies. And by the end of its three-hour runtime, there will definitely be tears."
"There are so many tonal shifts, big laughs, awkward laughs, long silences, explosions of anger, and cuttingly clever jabs that your head will spin (mine almost spun right off my neck)."

"The script administers a relentless string of laughs, most of them genuinely funny."

"The new comedy Baby Mama never comes fully to term, as it were."
"This movie, set in India, along with 'Nuevo orden' (2020) of Mexico, are both effective cautionary tales of the inherent dangers posed by income inequality and corruption. This is a danger in America as well, but nobody is paying attention, yet."
"A fine film that proves the past is never too bleak -- or the future too hopeless -- to discover a productive new life, and a home and family to share it."
"One of the great strengths of Farewell Amor is its intimacy, the sense it conveys of three people close together yet emotionally distant in Walter's small, narrow Brooklyn apartment. Another strength, and a huge one, is Mr. Mwine's portrayal of Walter."
"Hardly a massive gamble, Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher play a safe romcom hand you can tolerate."
"In its slow-moving, at times uncomfortable way, this is a heartwarming film."
"What could be dismissed as experimentation is instead framed with care and kindness as a first love, woozy and meaningful, bringing this fantasy world somewhere universal."
Another one of Leigh's rare but perfectly rendered period pieces.
"In this majestic setting, heavy with symbolic imagery, Lowery brings Gawain's tale to a conclusion seven centuries in the making. It's a daring piece of work, and an invitation to step out of the circle, to walk a new path, to write our own story afresh."
"Once we know them a bit, Rose and Teddy are decent company. The dilemmas that brought them to where they are at present are credible and the acting is good."
"Ted's Boston-accented zingers are expertly delivered by the director/star, whose voice talent is undeniable, and Wahlberg again demonstrates that he's skilled at comedy ... Seyfried proves adept as well ..."
"Paddington isn't just the film of the year, it might actually be one of the finest family films ever made."
"Though the sky might be falling, ""Thunder Road"" swirls about the tragicomedy of Officer Arnaud's plight with ease. It's hard to really forge a film that can wreck you and play with such liveliness."
"It's hard to deny the fact that, all this considered, it's a work of art, even with that title."
This is very good piece of filmmaking.
"This is the movie puts the ""oooh"" back in ""boo."""
"Ealing will for ever be associated with its celebrated comedies, but this chilling quintet deserves to be considered among the studio's finest achievements."
The Break-Up is more like Annie Hall told with Chicago attitude and work ethic.
"The film is always watchable, and the confrontations contain undeniable edgy excitement. But even if this weren't a remake, it would be a remake."
All of this material is so chilling and effective on its own that the movie's emphatic music and computer-generated graphics... can feel like overkill. But these flourishes serve the film's ultimate objective...
It's no classic but Troy does prove to be a damn good film overall.
An eye-opening feature debut by Matt Spicer goes straight for the jugular with its lacerations of social media and what he sees as his generation's dive into unmitigated narcissism.
"Whatever its flaws, the film gives you no chance to get bored."
Head-On is not pretty to watch most of the time. But it's pretty hard to forget even a dozen hours after the final credits have rolled.
"Starts out as light and innocuous fare, but then transforms into something quite special."
&#8220;Babe&#58; Pig in the City&#8221; is a wonderful family motion picture that touches various topics&#44; but doesn&#8217;t live up to the power and overwhelming brilliance of the original&#46;
"The Disappearance of Alice Creed begins with a van being stolen and ends with a different stolen vehicle being driven away. In between comes a tight, efficient thriller with just three actors and at least two whopper switcheroos."
"Where the original was defiantly not a concert film, but a chronicle of the astonished hubbub surrounding the first hipster folksinger, the follow-up's treasure lies with seven intact live performances."
"The film ends up being very nearly as good [as House of Usher], and better in some respects."
The Nightshifter is at its best when it's focused on the more grounded reality of Stênio's life and the very real and violent world around him.
Powerful

"Interestingly enough, I like the film more now -- presumably from it percolating in my head -- than I did immediately upon walking out of the theater. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, Sexual Content, etc. - also Available)"
"Its real power lies in the passage of time, the dull ache of loss and the grim satisfaction of revenge, and yearnings of love unrealized. There's an awful lot going on in this film, and all of it is good."
"What Patriot's Day manages to do, and do well, is take a story whose ending we are all familiar with and make it not just suspenseful, but emotionally wrenching."

"It is an anti-war movie, but not in the usual form we are accustomed to. It is a pro-people movie, the type of which we could use more."
Two generations within one family test boundaries in this intelligent and restrained coming-of-age drama.

"It's funny, it's heartfelt, and it just rocks!"

Every note brings us closer to these characters.

"While there are legitimate criticisms of America's space program, it's hard to argue with a film that defers so humbly to the primary source material."
One thing's for sure -- I'll never watch Iron Man the same way again.

"A strange hybrid, which dips into spurty horror and Lynchian parody, with added sexual awakening and shoe fetishism."
Murray gives his most soulful performance since Lost in Translation.. and gives the film its heart and its wicked edge.

"The excess in singing in this film is a bit fastidious, but it does give the film a feel more akin to literature than something cinematic. [Full Review in Spanish]"

It's a really iconic amazing movie.
"Galifianakis in particular carries the film with his ""between Two Ferns"" schtick. His tone of voice and delivery suits his character perfectly and reminds me of the first time I saw Shrek. It's the same vibe - namely bloody good."
It is straightforward storytelling of a little know true life suffering at the hands of a system that does not seem to care.

"Matt Reeves has outdone Christopher Nolan in presenting a realistic take on the source material without appearing ashamed of its comic book origins. It is the most like a ""real movie"" any comic book adaptation has felt in ages."
"Night of Kings aesthetic dissonance is discombobulating, but the discombobulation is surprisingly pleasing in its headiness, as Lacôte plays with naturalist filmmaking and spectacle right out of The Lord of the Rings."

"Jonze has crafted a sublime movie that's part dark satire, part metaphysical comedy, part bittersweet romance, part brain-bending sci-fi fable."
"De Palma's 1972 thriller is the first of his films to assemble all his signature traits &#8213; Gothic excess, stylistic bravado, a freewheeling approach to plot construction, and a manner of borrowing from Hitchcock that is as much parody as homage."

"This may be the most gifted cast yet assembled for a superhero movie, and it's enjoyable to simply watch them play pretend together... [However,] Apocalypse too often feels like a reworking of familiar elements."
"This film feels very authentic, like the viewer is peeking in on a real family trying to cope with a difficult situation. Part of that credit belongs to Payne's magnificent screenplay, but the cast is pretty special, too."
As gripping and entertaining as any thriller you'll encounter.
"Mann's first movie with feeling; his overwhelming love of its subject will turn audiences into exuberant, thrilled fight crowds."
"Witty about social pretensions, eloquent about failure & loss, acerbic about family, Allen's light-handed tragedy is a major work. Blanchett is dazzling as the fragile heroine."
"Journey to the Center of the Earth isn't so much an adaptation of the book but a very weak narrative film that uses action sequences from the book to make for cool, 3-D effects."
A dark comedy that snorts big laughs thanks to its gory antics and absurd story &#46;&#46;&#46; a wild fantasy beast action-horror&#44; stripping it down to the facts of the case and embellishing with the most monumental&#44; uproarious elaborations&#46;

A gonzo doco for the new media age.
"Peers empathetically into a tiny world and opens it up for its audience, who, in turn, will surely open their hearts to it."
"It’s as if all of France were implicated as the documentary’s virtual reverse angle—its challenging, defiant closeup."

Gibson keeps this movie afloat.
"For a movie that lasts longer than two hours and is made up solely of talking, it's impressive that the story never seems to drag."
"What holds Kornél Mundruczó's scrappy film all together is its fierce and forceful political metaphor: society's underdogs - be it ethnic minorities, the poor, the disenfranchised - if pushed too far, will bite back (in this case literally)."
"Ultimately, though, it's the music that really matters, and Hackford certainly doesn't deny his audience that pleasure."

Action trumps horror in this fast-paced zombie thriller.
"Working halfway round the world, Campion has fashioned a startling translation of later chapters in the American creation myth."

Rescue Rangers blows up our expectations of what a Disney reboot can be&#46;

...more entertaining than one might've anticipated...

"Were Donbass a documentary, like much of Loznitsas other work, then I might feel comfortable outright panning it, because then its primary job would be to explain this conflict to me. Instead, the primary job of this film is to lampoon it. "

I came away from it appreciating the craft but feeling a bit hollow.

Disney goes queer (and camp!) with Kenny Ortega's Hocus Pocus. thanks to the divine performances of its three leading ladies.
"Granted, watching something like In & Of Itself in your living room isn't quite the same experience as seeing the show in an intimate theatrical setting. But for now, it's the next-best thing, and as structured, a very good one at that."
"""Be yourself and don't care about whatever people think of you,"" 13-year-old Kayla sweetly advises on her YouTube channel. But Kayla is a little girl lost."
An enjoyable movie.

"It may not be as bizarrely entertaining as the film it obsesses over, but You Don't Nomi is a captivating document of how a piece of art-especially one this deeply, powerfully weird-can take on a life wholly beyond its original intentions."
"This is a rare, gentle movie. I don't think we'll see the likes of it again anytime soon."
A defiantly idiosyncratic film that summons the spirits of great Italian directors long past.

It's a damning account of self-deluded western power and its failures.
"This is a cautionary tale, about what happens when companies start selling a name instead of the goods and services it’s supposed to represent."
"Heinzerling has a great eye, and his conventional, low-key approach to cinematography in Cutie and the Boxer-no shaky camera, very few tracking shots, and adequate lighting-puts all the emphasis on his subjects."
A complex film that sidesteps every cliché. Paul Verhoeven and Isabelle Huppert are at the top of their game.

"John Carpenter's third movie (two years before Halloween), and one of his best."

Ducournau is tracing taboos to sketch a messy but compelling treatise on life's endless growing pains. Ride or die.
"Here, finally, is a children's film for real children, a sincere and humane work that is absent any franchise concerns or daydreams of ancillary product."
"The almost blank-slate idea of this protagonist is partially why the role is ideal for Reeves’ minimal expressiveness, even when he’s kicking maximum ass. Take away the sound and fury, and you still have momentum thanks to him."
The Maze Runner is better and more tightly constructed than a simple cash-in. It's a well-paced adventure-thriller with an intoxicating sense of mystery and the chutzpah to take huge leaps with its fictional world.
"Kline gives a beautiful performance, one every bit as moving as Williams' in Dead Poets Society, Robert Donat's in Goodbye, Mr. Chips and Michael Redgrave's in The Browning Version."
"Characters worth knowing, adventure worth seeking, and a delightful shift in tone that will bring a distinctive new flavor to the next phase of the ongoing ""Avengers"" saga."

"Ridley Scott and a vast army of actors, crew and extras produce a massive new Robin Hood that stands with the veteran director's best work."
The new Candyman is the bee's knees.
"[Guerrero] will be a filmmaking force for years to come, both within the horror field and the greater women's film movement as well."

It felt authentic ...

It's the kind of glorious cinema the rom-com genre deserves.

Will bring back a lot memories for anyone who lived through the space race.
Acts as a marvelous farewell to Ramis' invaluable contribution to those earlier movies.

"Yes, the film is grim, but it builds a space where that darkness can serve a purpose."
Markus Imhoof's bee documentary is so stuffed with surreal tableaux it makes your head spin.
"The movie has trouble stitching together disjointed episodes into a coherent narrative. Thanks to a strong voice cast, however, the characters retain their charm throughout."

The film oscllates between the playfully on the nose and the existentially profound with the confidence of a volcano chaser surfing on a river of lava.
Shyamalan's at his best here when leaning into the truly goofy ideas at the heart of the premise.
"It's a tale of two coexisting species, camels and humans, and it's surprisingly fascinating, funny and emotional."
"Scheinfeld's film does the hardest thing for a bio-doc to do: it gets what's great about the artist, and moves you in the same ways their art does."
"Wright's screenplay has a third act problem, where the revealing of the whats-and-hows aren't as interesting being lost in the whys."
"Winchester '73 is simply one of the finest Westerns ever made, in a class with the best of Ford and Hawks."
... the distraction-free bubble focuses the story on the key players and their emotional motivations to achieve maximum impact... (but) the real villain of this story is human fragility.
Adler's screenplay is excellent; it isn't often that a film takes an insightful look at how people can become unraveled.
A formidable actor's showcase.
"Has eccentricity in spades, and a winning performance in lead actress Loren Horsley, yet doesn't quite add up to the sum of its parts."
"At once gossamer and purposeful, it's Terrence Malick with a map."
"As much as I respect Climates, I can sympathize with viewers who will balk at the film's pretensions and glacial pacing."
"Arriving at a bleak time in modern history, the unbridled enthusiasm and playful attitude found within this film gleefully provide the perfect escapism we're likely all craving."
"While not everything here works, this is a poetical and distinctive effort whose commentary ultimately seems to go beyond gender relations to indict humanity's abuse of nature, and suggest an apocalyptic end result to climate change."
"Ultimately, rather than sex, what seems threatening here is impending adulthood in all its dimensions, and in its floaty, insubstantial way, It Follows catches some of the mingled excitement and terror of growing up."
You've Been Trumped follows the progress of Trump's monstrosity ... and it's a horror show to top anything you've ever seen in a Saturday night creature feature.
"While a local filmmaker's perspective may have brought more dimensions, the coverage of events here is impressive and on the mark."
"Every bit as funny as ""Analyze This."""
"I love the straightforward gall of Frozen. Here's a horror film that's confident enough to abandon superficial scares in favor of a far more insidious, intellectual concept"
"It may look like a documentary but Gibney's film is a horror film in every sense. Essential, uncomfortable viewing."
"Counterbalancing these shortcomings, however, is the comic chemistry of Coogan and Brydon. Numerous sterling moments result from their brainy, breezy pairing."
"Sky High pokes gentle fun at growing up, entering a new school, joining cliques, adjusting to friends and parents, dealing with peer pressure, and learning who you are."
"For its eventual lurid machinations and hyped-up emotionalism, the film winds up being a handsomely efficient one-man show."
"Mildly diverting, but no classic"

Vital viewing on society's road to enlightenment; a path O'Connor still travels herself.
"Moland pitches the material perfectly, with the blacker-than-black comedy standing in stark contrast to the snow-covered landscapes, beautifully photographed by Philip Øgaard."
"Keep an Eye Out serves as a solid starting point. For those already indoctrinated, it's another welcome dispatch from cinema's premier purveyor of perplexing paradoxes."
"It does go to some dark places and our heroine emerges as a yet another shining example of a feminist horror avenger, if not nearly as iconic as some that came before her."
"Luckily for us, the flawed but charming Mr. Malcolm’s List has Indian actress Freida Pinto as a winsome romantic lead, finally receiving her flowers in a perfectly matched role."
"One of the problems with Christian films is that they can come off as very preachy. ""To Save a Life"" doesn't necessarily tone down its religious overtones, but it does try to make the religious aspects as organic as possible."
Why Did I Get Married covers a lot of emotional and cultural ground in its two hours.
Murder Mystery&apos; 2&apos;s  script is ok for the most part&#44; but nothing one wouldn&apos;t expect from a murder mystery&#46;
"An appealing, often hilarious corrective to the conventional pop cultural idealization of the superhero."
This film doesn't take political sides -- and it's all the more heartbreaking because of its restraint.
There have been many portrayals of Van Gogh onscreen. Part of what makes [Willem] Dafoe's interpretation so successful is his outright refusal to present him as a madman.

A startlingly joyous revisionist Western.
"A quirky, idiosyncratic, Harryhausen-inspired, art house creature feature with the poetry and narrative depth characteristic of misunderstood monster classics such as The Creature from the Black Lagoon and The Bride of Frankenstein."
"Stewart's strained stoicism bounces nicely off of Maadi's winningly garrulous performance, which he has to give almost entirely through a small window in the door of Amir's cell."
"To make a long story short, Godzilla vs. Kong is oodles of fun."
"While I feel the movie cuts to the chase a little too soon, possibly due to budget constraints, it's one heck of an entertaining ride."

"It's certainly enjoyable to watch the beanie-hatted, craggy-faced Dafoe set animal traps with his bare hands."
"More humble than Fahrenheit 9/11 and as enthralling as Bowling For Columbine, Sicko is another target hit square on the nose for America's premier documentalist."

A cerebral and emotionally resonant examination of language through the genre of science fiction.
Saint Frances explores the ways in which women at all stages of life present one face to the world while hiding another...

A sharp and satisfyingly fat-free account of how a wily salesman took a lucrative Southern California burger joint and turned it into the world's biggest fast-food empire.
"With playful self-reflexivity, Dupieux uses his central gimmick to satirize the nature of cinematic conceits."
"Even in such a visually sumptuous work, Kieslowski is brave enough to tell us -- through blackouts, blurred focus and commanding stillness -- not to look, but simply to listen."
It's hard to recapture or exceed that magical feeling of seeing something new and unique as the first Incredibles presented itself to be. Incredibles 2 is such a worthy sequel that it certainly warrants another sequel to become a bigger franchise.
"It's both a lesser Shane Black movie and a lesser Predator movie, but it's still a Shane Black Predator movie."
...heartfelt and poetic...
"Jon Jost's most accessible work imports the lyrical camera of his film essays and the violence inherent in his Western to a poignant, wistful meditation about the discrepancy between art and spiritual decay."
"Often gripping and fascinating, it's bound to create waves of controversy."
"Everyone in The Housekeeper has an emotional shield, and director Berri penetrates that shield with warmth, intelligence and a genuine compassion for human tomfoolery."

"But for the most part, [Rian] Johnson pulls it off with a unique take on all of those key Star Wars staples, which he fills with humor and childlike imagination-creating so many moments when the audience erupted in cheers."
a story that's less like fiction and more like the way that families (and countries) actually age.
"Deodorized and sanitized but memorably filmed and scored, 'Trishna' is less fully satisfactory in capturing the clutching crush and implication of the subcontinent's megacities."
"Writers Alex Kurtzman and Robert Orci, along with Jeff Pinkner, have built something very familiar, even conventional, and that approach pushes the things that work to the foreground even as it makes a case for the limitations of the entire genre."
Boy Meets Girl feels fresh and direct even if it's full of explanations that should have happened years earlier.
"If you've never seen a Johnnie To crime picture, Exiled is a simple, stylish, and utterly delightful introduction."

Foxtrot is a cinematic delight with a profound message at its heart and many striking shots that resonate long after the final credits roll.
"A sickeningly potent case study... But it's also a tense, engaging piece of narrative."
"""Draft Day"" might be a trick play, but it manages to score."
"No one will ever credit ""Snatched"" with discovering new comic territory. But it earns its share of laughs by covering some well-trod ground."
"At its most affecting, this uneven quasi-fantasy is about people hungering for myth"
The increasingly impressive Taylor-Johnson dominates the screen time.
This story is a new look at a narrative that was already ancient when Kipling wrote 12 decades ago.
"Our heroines, who have known one another since they were nine, have a distinctive natural rapport with each other as the end credits run over home movies from their youth."
A tidy and engrossing corruption drama.
"It is a complex, hard to follow onslaught of characters and concepts rooted in mythology and classical literature. And while it isn't completely successful by any means, it is still something completely original and new."
"As undercooked as Little Women can occasionally feel, it's always enjoyable, with some great shots made for the canvas and other small charms throughout."
The movie's sanguinary suspense should keep horror fans happily howling; others may watch portions through their fingers.
"A sentence like 'I'm thinking of ending things' can create an expectation of dread, and that's certainly the approach Kaufman takes as he spins his tale."
"""Wild Indian"" is marked by its restraint. Nothing is forced or obvious."
This is an amazing movie.
Dany Boon is like a mime you don't want to shoot.
"[""Daddy Day Care""] is a straightforward, don't-expect-any-surprises kind of pre-summer entertainment that has a good supporting cast, precocious kids and a premise that lends itself to slapstick comedy."
THEM! was one of the better Fifties science fiction films and one of only a handful that are still fairly effective forty years after it was made due in large part to some very intelligent script choices.
"The Waiting Room is beautifully filmed and masterfully edited, but feels too careful and polished to have the emotional impact of activist filmmaking."
"This is acting of extraordinary power, all the more astonishing from an actress whose performances in the Star Wars movies were ridiculed for their woodenness."
Taxi Driver is a cinematic masterpiece and Scorsese&apos;s best direction of his career&#46;
Redford and Newman provide the real sting.
"It's uplifting and inspiring to see a coach who brings out the best in his girls. Like the documentary Hoop Dreams, this turns out to be a whole lot more than just a movie about basketball."
Material like this is only as good as the acting and writing. The Ref is skillful in both areas.
"Whenever Jarmusch lets his soundtrack - and his stars - do the talking, the right notes get struck."
The studio's lackluster release will likely mean it'll thrive on DVD. Don't wait for that. Youth in Revolt is worth making a trip to the theaters.

"While this film is way too long and might be more for Tolkien devotees than mainstream audiences, after a slow start it turns into a rousing adventure with plenty of visual flair and top-notch action sequences."
Travolta and Cage then had the acting difficulty of adopting the other person's mannerisms while retaining their own voice and body. There are both superb at it...

"Inventively examines bigotry, combining daring humor and hyperbole, dark realism and shining idealism."
This thing is equal parts a hoot and a gasp-inducer.
"Roth's satire of fright junkie male castration fears and feminist castration fantasies, mandates that you're going to have to have your cock and eat it too, whether consumed live during elegant dining to the sound of opera, or by killer canine pets."
An appealing romantic drama that proves it is never too late to turn your life around by taking a risky leap into the dark.
"What we have here is a deeply flawed but frequently rewarding picture, with a lot to say about how stories can both guide and misguide us."
"Even if you're not all that familiar with the duo Sparks, you're likely to finish the film with a giant smile on your face and not just because they were your ""favorite band's favorite band,"" as the doc's tagline proclaims."
I was ensnared by its stoner charms.
"Expect nominations all around, with actor/writer/director/producer and songwriter Cooper on the verge of a boatload, maybe even for contributing to an eclectic, sure-to-be-soaring soundtrack."
"A nice mix of old-fashioned imagination (anagrams, pranks, secret spaces) and newfangled effects (gizmos, gadgets, graphics), it's a rollicking, never obnoxious family flick."
"Silly, surreal and squeezable, SpongeBob scores again."
"""The Descendants"" goes on too long, but that's its only flaw. And frankly, I can see why Payne and his editor decided to go with this print instead of making some awfully tough decisions."
"John Carter, a rousing science-fiction adventure adapted from Edgar Rice Burroughs' early 20th-century pulp novels, is a rare bird that's at the same time strikingly modern and engagingly old-fashioned."
"Haddish is a wild-card actress that Lee keeps playing in Girls Trip, and he draws an inside straight nearly every time."
"Below... is a stripped-back, pitch-black sci-fi farce."
A fascinating account of a man who loved stirring the pot until he was the one sitting in it.
"What works best in Anne Rice's books are the depth of characters and their psyches. Which is also one of the hardest things to incorporate into film, and notably absent..."
"The abundance of footage, and the space it's given to breathe - the movie is almost two and a half hours long - captures the restless loneliness of superstardom."
"There's no reinventing of the wheel here, but an authentic, enthusiastic and well-observed continuation of the universe."
Equally provocative and profound&#44; On the Count of Three tackles an often ignored conversation with the gravity it deserves&#46; 
"Avoiding the sensationalism that would have come so easily, the skill with which Meyers varies the tone of My Friend Dahmer, as he takes us from humour to darkness and back again, is simply compelling."
A picture of cultural displacement and Anglo-Indian rapprochement almost worthy of EM Forster.
"A thoroughly entertaining, mischievous comic romp."
"In terms of intellectual and emotional stimulation, who could ask for more?"
It was all the things that you want from an M. Night Shyamalan movie.
"For those willing to give Diaz's film a chance, Norte will provide one of the year's best viewing experiences."

"Boorman has crafted a witty, classy and richly enjoyable morality play, which skewers the mercenary self-interest behind Anglo-American imperialism almost as an afterthought."
The film turns what at first seemingly appears as Kodak moments into a study of a soul in transition.
"..it's director Vaughn who emerges as the true hero here (the less said of January Jones' leaden performance, the better), using a breathless pace and off-kilter compositions to mask the story's many gaps in logic."

"Lloyd makes something genuinely nightmarish of the worst attacks, but Dunne's creased vulnerability ... keeps us tethered to waking reality."
"Aa lengthy, talky quest for meaning, punctuated by long takes and huge moments of silence. Ultimately though, it's a rewarding one for sure, especially once you fall under the spell of its hypnotic filmmaking."
Another masterpiece from Wim Wenders and Sam Shepard.
"I can't say that Rat Film is a cheery experience, but it's certainly an indelible one."
"The film finds its strength in the quintet of lesser known players, especially Zapruder and, oddly enough, Oswald's stoic brother, who's cast in a heroic, almost Kennedy-esque, light."
&#8230;with no body-horror&#44; gore or even effects&#44; Schroeder does a remarkable job of maintaining grown-up narrative tension&#44; and the pay-off is surprising satisfying&#8230;
"The result, while it might greatly affront scholars, is a film brimming with warmth, heart and intelligence. Remarkably, it is O’Connor’s directorial debut."
A stylish if somewhat disjointed film.
"It's dysfunctional, but strangely affirming."
The fact that it&#8217;s such a standard&#44; nothing special&#44; screenplay is a letdown&#44; but the aerial scenes are first-rate&#44; and the actors are believable&#44; even when saddled with tired cliches&#46;
"Sam Elliott's smoky, whiskey-soaked baritone is one of American cinema's undervalued treasures... It pretty much rescues Brett Haley's... The Hero, cutting clean through the film's pile of clichs with its gruff feeling and wry, weary wit."
"Remarkable! A small, intimate kind of movie that deserves to be cradled and cherished, not slathered in crass award-show buzz and industry politics."
"With churning performances and a terrific recreation of the period, the film is a startling story of a woman caught in an impossible situation. So it's a shame that it's rather muted."

... a beautiful piece of work.
"This is not just the first feature by Haifaa Al Mansour but the first feature to be directed by a woman from Saudi Arabia. That is quite a burden, and yet by some miracle the movie bears it with lightness and grace."

"It follows a pretty familiar arc, but it hits the required beats with style and a couple of surprisingly well-considered performances."
Becky is a breezy blast and a gnarly genre gem that horrifically turns the plot of Home Alone on its head&#44; with terrific turns from Lulu Wilson and Kevin James&#46;&#10;&#10;

"With the same anchor of family and hope in the younger generation, Peninsula is a worthy follow up to Train to Busan, if a little more of what wed expect from a typical zombie action film."

A perfectly amiable and often funny animation feature aimed largely at children but not childish or pandering in any way.

It misses on the big emotional gut-punch -- but it's good enough at least that you wish it was better.
Kovgan's respect for the work as well as the life of her subject is clear and she's captured much of that spirit.
"Thankfully, the strong performances make it easy to watch. I just wish the filmmakers had the conviction to make this into a truly great film. (Parental Review also Available)"
"Aside from the outlaw aspects of the filming, it's never quite as interesting as you want it to be. But who knew that the Happiest Place on Earth could be so convincingly cast as a shadowy fever dream?"

"The simple beauty of the entire package is well summed up by Phedon Papamichael's beautiful black-and-white cinematography, which makes everything at once all the more modest yet majestic."

"body horror told from a female perspective, charting the desire - vain in every sense - for eternal youth."
The film is a cracking tick-tock account of how the sausage gets made in the world of sports marketing&#44; but it also has the very &apos;movie-ish&apos; pleasures of watching fun actors have fun conversations&#46;
"The antidote to M:i:III, Pirates II and every other circus of coagulated stunts is Miami Vice, my favorite Hollywood movie of the summer so far."

"And while some of the laughs are certainly hilarious, they aren't as plentiful as necessary to make Norbit a consistently funny film."
"Andrew Currie's script incisively observes how taboo preferences have become policies in the reality ""Fido"" creates. Macabre and satirical with the brash brio of all great zombie movies, ""Fido"" understands that the true ghouls' hearts are still beating."
"Run starts off as a Horror movie, but quite soon it becomes clear that this is an A to Z Thriller flick. Halfway through audiences should probably turn up a notch their suspension of disbelief in order to keep enjoying this one."

"The sequel reminded me a lot about what I liked about the first one. While it also reminded me that I thought the predecessor worked a little better, I find Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows more than satisfying."

"Brooklyn's Finest is a realistic, disheartening and brutal look into the lives of three different cops at three different stages in their careers."
"Where The Lodge succeeds is in its patient atmosphere-building and downer psychedelic style, delivering neatly staged and effective shocks."
"The latest in a series of work about the cost of the refugee crisis and human migration, For Sama is a harrowing experience and certainly one of the most essential films of the year."
"Consider the $4,970,802,499 its quintet of leads has made for Paramount at the box office as long-held escrow on a legendary prank. Robert Downey Jr. is all wild-eyed brilliance, Tom Cruise is re-christened in cool and the film is comic gold."

"""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" is an origin story that gets the late Tom Clancy's signature superspy right."
"""78/52"" delves far deeper into the shower scene analysis than anything I have seen or read before, and that is quite a bit."

"Another great feel-bad treat from Martin McDonagh, featuring one of Colin Farrell’s best performances yet as a guy trying (and failing) to deal with the fallout of a falling out."

"Air Doll works as an interesting, solid drama and character study while also addressing much bigger real-world themes and ideas, including loneliness and the roles of women in society. "

"Carney understands how music not only provides a soundtrack for a life, but can change a life, too."
"Lapica's debut impresses with its strong, clear voice and desire to tell a very personal story not just of substance abuse but of that abuse's painful root cause."

The Love Jones comparisons aren't necessarily off as The Photograph probably deserves to be similarly appreciated without the cult classic label this time.

The new creative team effectively taps into a quarter century of real-world affinity from fans for some clever meta commentary within the film.

A remarkable study of obsessive filmmaking that ranks as one of the best movies of the year.
Entertainingly gritty until an ending that seems to go against all that has preceded it.
"Decent, but not consistently strong and -- at least in the case of our screening -- ruined by an obnoxious audience that didn't fully understand what sort of pic they were really seeing. (Full Content Parental Review also available)"
It does come off as a slightly watered-down Pan's Labyrinth - it steps towards the abyss of strangeness but never quite leaps off

"This emotionally wrenching drama is an actors' showcase, a primer on quick-and-dirty filmmaking that nonetheless looks beautiful, and a welcome-to-the-big-leagues party for Anne Hathaway."
An epic work. [Full review in Spanish]

"The film doesn't ask to judge King so much as consider a broader portrait, bigger than the muck the FBI peddled, but maybe more complex and dimensional than what our marble statues also suggest. It makes him loom larger."
"Foxx gives one of the year's best performances, and early talk about an Oscar nomination is entirely justified."
"Powered almost entirely by Black's infectious charisma and eccentricity, School of Rock is raucous and heartwarming comedy."
Gets at something deeply unsettling about the human condition.
A thrilling character study but only an average action flick.
"They do get the right actresses for this, though. All three of these women contribute worthy reactions and riffs, though the straw that stirs this drink is Hahn, who is so underappreciated that it's no longer funny."
"So while, similar to the real-life human being it portrays, the movie ""Harriet"" might have its flaws, it is an important depiction for our time: at least as important as a future president's supposed chopping down of a cherry tree."
"This is a gloriously gonzo trip packed with enough odd narrative tangents to fill half a dozen features. While not always successful, this energetic mash-up so genuinely wants to entertain that it's hard not to be won over by its barrage of absurdity."
Goodfellas by way of Wild Strawberries...
"Jamie, Pritti, Hugo, Loco... These figures are designed to appeal to girls, boys and everyone in between. As such, they more than deserve to be the talk of the town."

The 'stars' definitely aligned to make this picture work.
This fifth movie is where fans who understand the intrinsic darkness of the series will stand up and be counted.

"""A Fantastic Woman"" is above all the story of a woman who loves, loses her love and fights for the universal human right to experience her loss and mourn for it, so that she will be able to get on with her life."

"Even if the movie is less real than it aspires to be, the connection between the two leads feels totally genuine."
"A master class in cinematic formalism, from a man with a lifetime of knowledge and experience."
"I LOVED it. An amazing cast of characters led flawlessly by Daniel Craig, Chris Evans and Ana de Armas. The moment I thought I knew what was happening, a twist threw me. One of my year's favorite films."
"It's as creepy as it needs to be, and not even remotely as creepy as its asinine R-rating would indicate, and it's pretty shallow beyond that."
"Wise beyond her years, [Nika, played by Bronislawa Zamachowska] has a curt, verging on antagonistic relationship with her old man, but she's a ray of light in an otherwise grave endeavour."
Extraordinarily vivid and fresh.
At least in Big Miracle people stop haranguing others across the aisle and start working together.
'It turns out that Ethan Hawke can act after all. Who knew?'
"A seriously good movie, a challenge to viewers, a rebuke of the way many Americans live their lives."
Even those who don't know a Marvel hero from a DC caped crusader will find themselves having a grand time. That's because Whedon manages to tap the inner fanboy and fangirl dormant in us all.
"One of Mr. Kapadia's most inspired strokes in this valuable documentary is to put her lyrics on screen as she sings them, so we can see for ourselves the essential elements of her songs as they reflected, and intertwined with, her tumultuous life."
What can be said about Concussion outside that it's Will Smith's best performance in years? Too bad it's for a movie mostly plays it safe and isn't as thrilling or biting as it aspires to be.
What a treat it is to discover a totally new actor inside one we already loved. And how sad to know we won't see that from him again.
Polanski's tremendous skill with creating dramatic tension ensures that we're in for a gripping as well as a very funny ride.
"A personal film for John Huston, starring daughter Anjelica and adapted to the screen by son Tony, this very last work evokes beautifully the mood and texture of James Joyce's lyrical story."
"There's something achingly liminal about (Lee's) cinema, where the emotions exist in the in-between spaces along society's edges, between words and glances, never fully expressed in words but keenly felt just the same."
"...starts out well enough, with its quirky directorial touches and even quirkier storyline, but finally becomes just too overwhelming."
"Judy dazzles during its musical numbers... [and] Zellweger throws herself into the title role and transcends playing Garland, never falling into camp, or mimicking the singer. She also captures Garland's mannerisms without making them seem fake."
"As in Field's first film, the characters are drawn with such compassion their follies become our own and their desires seem as vast as the night sky."

Represents big budget filmmaking at its finest and long-form storytelling at its most emotionally rewarding.
"By his own admission, Hytner is not a film stylist who can ""think with a camera,"" but he handles Bennett's tales with crisp economy."

"If the build-up inevitably shares Juliette's coldness, the conclusion is rich with emotion, raising questions about psychology, morality and more - even if it doesn't wholly convince."
"A sensitive and beautiful film - one that contains genuine insight into the power of human connection, be it romantic, sexual, or some combination of both."
"A giddy, gory, beautifully mounted trash spectacle ... at least so far."
"Unapologetically harsh and heedlessly entertaining despite its imperfections, the film includes two masterful performances from Crowe and Bale - actors so intense, they could wear red and intimidate a charging bull."
Salma Hayek gives the performance of her career in this stealth weapon of a comedy from director Miguel Arteta and screenwriter Mike White.
"Zack Snyder's epic adaptation gives this generation a Superman movie to call its own. Call it ""Superman Begins""."
"The silliest spin-off this side of Elektra, and lots of fun with it."
"Despite its formulaic structure, The Abandoned has a lot going for it. It eschews cheap scares, bloodletting, and gore."
"Moore still hasn't learned some basic rhetorical skills: Will he ever figure out that acknowledging contrary views gives your argument more credibility? But his movie is shocking, poignant and surprisingly entertaining."
"As it is, I admire the brilliance of the majority of this picture to no-end; it's just that pesky literal ending I walked out wanting to declare war on."

"Flee is an effective and striking story told in a uniquely cinematic way.

"

"If you loved the show, you'll likely love the movie; if you detest the show, you'll hate the movie. Personally, I fall closer to the middle."
...a bewildering extension rather than a retread of this played-out subgenre.
"The camera stays on Bannon, and what we see is a man who reveals himself even as he thinks he's gaining the upper hand."
"The film, shot on natural locations in Norway, benefits enormously from the breathtaking beauty of the country, and it looks like a much bigger-budget film than it is."
"It becomes a mesmerising personal vision thanks to Vigo's sophisticated blend of fairy-tale romance, documentary realism, surrealist fantasy, bawdy humour and working-class song."
"A $130 million epic with much to marvel at and great battle scenes, but it dazzles the senses while barely touching the heart."
Pleasure elicits a taunt and razor-sharp depiction of adult film&apos;s dysfunctional climate&#46; 
"The best Ashley Judd movie Judd has never made... a labyrinthine serial killer thriller that won't win admirers for its intellect, but does have sustenance of mood in spades."
"Hanks is being given an awards season push here, no surprise, though he's bound to be hindered by the fact that he makes it all look so easy."
"It's more like an interesting, in-depth article in The New Yorker than a movie."
"Fegley and his character miss it for me because of an innate selfishness in motivation, plus overall meanness to the story's pranks."
A formulaic yet fun adventure.
"Audiences ready, willing and able to find their inner four-year-old may have a decent time at 'Daddy Day Care,' but others are likely to find Eddie Murphy's latest foray into kidpicdom scarcely more amusing than spending 90 minutes in a pre-K classroom."
[T]reat[s] the charming nonsense of food falling from the sky like weather with exactly the sort of bouyant nimbleness it deserves...
"An intense, headily sensual epic with a sometimes overcooked feel and oodles of Euro-artiness."
"Onward might not quite hit the zenith of the gargantuan Pixar mountain, but it's just one more burst of gas away from that sky-high summit."
"Throughout, Judd Apatow dramatizes the ideal of community with an almost Eastwoodian sense of rapture."
The Forgiven takes a while to grab hold&#44; overcoming its awkward and meandering beginning to settle into being a powerful slow burn of a morality tale&#44; delivered with a memorable performance by one of the great actors of our time&#46;
This is heady stuff - a more natural fit for a black-and-white Bergman than a kiddie caper.
"In a year that's seen mainstream cinema struggle to reach any great heights, it's refreshing to find a film that's as engaging and defiantly hard-to-pin down as Elle."
It's a marvelous film. [Full review in Spanish]
"Breathtakingly beautiful, truly magical movie."
"Assayas uses the supernatural to explore grief, and Stewart portrays Maureen's heartbreaking loneliness with skill. She completely carries the film."
"McDonagh explores this village of secrets with tremendous care and craftiness, and provides Gleeson with another stellar opportunity to deliver striking work."
"For people won't have seen the original ""Oldboy"" or anything remotely like it, this will be a rare studio release that feels shocking and abrasive and perverse and in some way new."
"The film actually improves on Cunningham's novel, thanks to gorgeous cinematography, a deft script by playwright David Hare ... a mournful, melodious but never intrusive score by Philip Glass and a superb cast."
"A quietly moving piece of Irish cinema, The Quiet Girl doesn’t wear its heart on its sleeve, but it sure as hell has one."
"There are some impressive special effects, but the picture is more a charming character study than a futuristic adventure."
"The director manages to sustain the film's quirky emotional tone, much more important than sustaining a plot."
Atmospheric and bewitching.

"Deeply frightening, telling a story that could bore into your kids' nightmares if you're not careful."

One doesn't leave the movie with a mind blown by visual bedazzlement but with a soul shattered by the profound sense of tragedy Linklater and company so beautifully put across.
The connection between Rudy Ray Moore and Eddie Murphy - both in a fictional and real world perspective - is what makes this a rewarding viewing experience.
"It's the blurring of boundaries that makes Wildcat more than just an excruciating series of intensifying scenes of torture, disorienting for the audience as well as the characters."
Danny Boyle's purposeful direction and Mark Tildesley's imaginative and resourceful production design keep this fresh and edgy; the images of a wasted London and the details of a paramilitary organization in the countryside are both creepy and persuasive.
"It wasn't the automatic laughter produced by slam-dunk punch lines, but the laughter of recognition, of insight, even sometimes of squirmy discomfort, as the truths hit close to home."
"Of course it's no ""Chinatown,"" but it is satisfyingly moody and atmospheric."
[H]umanity is what Thor has in spades.
"The majority of the gags, as crude as they can be, hit the mark and the interplay between Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly keeps the film from becoming a repetitive bore."

"In different hands, Snowpiercer might have been just another generic action movie. Yet with South Korean director Bong Joon-ho at the helm, it's instead something more off-kilter and more disturbingly satisfying."

"If you know any teenage boys with anger issues or a tendency to get into trouble, this movie definitely speaks their language."
"This is a movie about losing one's grip and like any addict's story, it's boring, ugly, sad, and terribly human. And surprisingly funny."
"While ""Kong: Skull Island"" is visual eye candy, its sophistication and excellence negate the fairy tale-magical quality that endeared the original to generations of filmgoers."
"A satisfying and prickly low-key hum of discontent and moral exploration. In Muntean's exhausted landscape, the world wont listen even when its stuck in frozen mud."

"Harold Ramis's direction is nothing special, yet there is a beautiful, lip-smacking efficiency in the way that a great idea is touched off and followed to its conclusion."
"Puppet-master technique and a generally well orchestrated sense of moodiness help this chiller deliver on more than it botches, despite a fumbled third act."
"On display in Poster is the full panoply of pop music's glorious, ego-warped idiocy, from the demented bubble of an entourage to pseudo poses of humility by the famous."
"""You could say that the film is not about anything but, really, it's about everything""."
(Seabiscuit) is a mixed feedbag of hackneyed cliche and inspired drama. In a curious way it has a pace and momentum not unlike a racehorse. It is a slow starter with a pecular gait that rapidly builds up speed and finishes a winner by a nose at the wire.
"They've cranked it up another couple notches for Crank: High Voltage, with mixed results."
[Crowe's] work here is indeed a thing of beauty.

I&apos;m Thinking of Ending Things is one of the best films of 2020&#46;
Phillips directs a pretty entertaining film that is commanded by Phoenix's performance. His commitment to the role is Joker's most compelling aspect and he makes it his own through his physicality and delivery.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt is shaping up to be the real deal.
"The world needs this movie, and whether you're a fan of deeply personal stories of triumph, or just the Springsteen discography, you'll be absolutely stunned by what this film has to offer."
"Justin McConnell is compelling in his honesty and so obviously in love with his subject. It's a beautiful work about all the hard work that goes on behind the scenes. For film lovers, industry insiders, and hopeful dreamers alike ..."
"""Knives Out"" is as much a 'toon as it is a hat tip to the elaborate mechanics of an Agatha Christie mystery. It's silly and suspenseful in equal measure."
For all its flaws&#44; Elvis remains a remarkably entertaining experience&#44; the credit for which rests largely with its star&#46; Butler is the strongest element film&#44; and the energy with which he infuses the musical numbers is undeniably electrifying&#46;
A bittersweet comedy-drama that manages to be hilarious in one scene and extremely touching in the next.
"A remarkable, heartfelt and hilarious journey that will leave you homesick with recognition."
"An enlightening script, expert ensemble acting and the most revealing film ever made about a young woman's right to choose."

Jurassic World&#58; Dominion has a terrible script but achieves thrilling&#44; CGI-fueled action&#46; My issues are mitigated by pure entertainment value&#46; Who doesn&apos;t enjoy watching a Pterosaur rip a plane out of the sky&#63;

"For its story moment before the gathering storm broke, this film is a garden wall held up, a finger in the dyke, just before the deluge and fall into darkness."
"By no means a masterpiece of the genre, but it's a slickly made picture that more than delivers on the promise made on its poster--oh yes, there will be blood."
"[Notturno is a] film that does not seek to document war atrocities but rather to observe their aftermath, it is an earnest look at those who have been left behind, those whose hearts are bleeding even if they seem to have healed."
"What makes Match Point, a coolly deliberate murder mystery from Woody Allen, so startling is that it feels as if the director himself has been done away with."
"A well-felt celebration of romantic, emotional and physical maturity, filled with laughs and tears. It's also something of a revelation when it comes to Diane Keaton's range."
"Frequency submits itself for our approval as a solid thriller, if not necessarily a timeless one."
Gbravica is a womanly movie in the best sense: [writer-director] Zbanic has a deeply feminine sense of how crisis gets filtered through the moments of daily life.

"Andrew Niccol proves once again to be one of our great emerging satirists with this creepy, funny film."

"If you want some actual science in your science fiction, though, the only 2013 movie (so far; Gravity is still coming) that delivers is Europa Report. And oh how it does deliver."
"Crimes of the Future seems a charmingly grisly artefact of the past, the result of cinemagoers mutating to accept Cronenberg films without a qualm."
"Girls Trip doesn't tread into the realm of body horror like The Beguiled or Rough Night (or hormonal horror, like 20th Century Women), but it allows four charismatic and well-matched leading ladies to give audiences an evening of good, unclean fun."
"The only difference is that three of the five have a learning disability - but in this documentary, which is very funny in places, it's not disabilities that define them."
"To make Holmes palatable to technology addicted, everything's gotta-go-fast moviegoers throw Indiana Jones and Harry Potter themes at the screen and see what sticks."

"It's Godard, in what may or may not be the final chapter of his filmmaking career -- at 80 he's just a kid compared to director Manoel de Oliveira, over 100 years old and still making movies -- and he's still deliberately messing with the audience."

"Decades after it was made, Lola, Demy's auspicious directing debut starring Anouk Aimee, is just as impressive, lyrical and touching as it was in 1961."
"Helping to make these pleasantries funny is their spur-of-the-moment quality, the same quick spontaneity that characterizes chance remarks overheard at raucous movie houses. Capturing that bright and unexpected quality is what the MST3K crew does best."

"Coogler's realistic debut recreates Grant's final day with affection, refusing to cast him as either saint or sinner."
"Trier plays with formal qualities while also baring dark emotions, Triers style, allusive as literature, elusive as lyrical cinema, is virtuosic but intrinsically ragged."

A strong debut with a remarkable performance by Michael Greyeyes that delves on complex themes that are rarely explored on screen. [Full Review in Spanish]

That authenticity lends the film both a visceral dread as well as a complicated compassion.
Their dynamic is the main strength of the film; it's just a shame so much reverence has been paid to the novel's many twists and turns. It's paced more like a TV mini-series than a cinematic experience.

"Writer/director Stu Zicherman's last work in Hollywood was co-writing Jennifer Garner superhero movie Elektra, so A.C.O.D. is quite at least a big step in the right direction, but I hope there's a little more craft and a little more bite on the next film."
"Azazel Jacobs' observant comedy-drama ""The Lovers"" digs into the messiness of a long-time marriage that is teetering on the edge of oblivion. And yet ""Lovers"" is a film that's light on its feet, wry and even affectionate."

"A lowlife billiards drama that lacks the drive and edginess of the classic The Hustler, Poolhall Junkies does get by on its humor, energy and earnest charm."
A film that gives a story about political (and physical) resistance with interesting characters. [Full review in Spanish]
"With an original concept, chilling kills, and stunning performances, The Call is more than worth picking up."

Robin Wright's assured directorial debut plays like a companion piece to Nomadland... and that's no bad thing.

"Best of all, Monster House employs technology that allows for facial expressions and nuances of performance in its animated characters."
"If you like your comedies scripted rather than seemingly improvised or if you thrill to see stories at war with clich, Dope is the feel-good, crowd-pleaser of the summer."
The message one takes away about humanity is not necessarily unexpected&#44; but at least the charm of seeing it through this Equidae perspective keeps the film from wearing out its welcome&#46;

An imaginative family film featuring a tremendously mischievous and likable lead character.
Very stylish Sicilian mafia movie. One part Antonioni and one part Calvin Klein commercial.

[A] madly flitting butterfly of a film.
"Not just noteworthy as the first picture written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, this excellent neo-noir also stands as an important film in the development of the American independent cinema during the 1980s."
"However shocking the film may have been at the time, it has grown not only as a cult object to be cherished by genre aficionados, but as a work that improves with the addition of contexts that underscore its distinct place in film history. "
"Directed brilliantly, it is a great film whose power might have been missed or ridiculed before 9-11 and whose subject would have been too hard to take right after 9-11."
It contains all the pain and hard work of a real-life relationship. Those who want to work for it will admire Happy Accidents.
"Despite a robust military opening, the film doesn't spark until John Slattery hits screen, from there it blossoms, flashing back, flashing forward, nestling into a nice beat."
"It's easy to claim that Voyagers is Lord of the Flies in space, and it is, which is what makes it good, but it's also a fascinating study of gaslighting and how fear can push the masses to follow a mad man."
John Hughes was born in 1950 but connected deeply with the next generation's cultural brooding.
...it's not difficult to see why the film has endured since it's release or why a sequel was commissioned just a few years later.
"This is not a bad film, but certainly it is the film we are left with having not been given a particularly good one."
"Rejoice, Hollywood has made a movie that the Religious Right can like - if you take away the blood and gore. It's nice to know my iPod will work in a post apocalyptic world."
...A highly partisan and energetic documentary
"It's imperfect, but it's enjoyable, and it sure looks good."
"The War Room director R J Cutler is a serious filmmaker, and while some may think fashion is a less than serious subject (Wintour's daughter Bee being one of them, as we find out in one amusing scene), his film is a riveting insight."
"Only ""God of Love"" seems a bit slight and amateurish for Academy Award contention."
Rises above late-night basic cable trash thanks to the courageous cast and Mitchell's accomplished direction.
"A Michael Mann movie is a Michael Mann movie, and fans will not be disappointed."
Watching them snipe at each other was one of the undeniable pleasures of the 2010 movie season.
"This production is alt comedy at its finest, as John Mulaney and Nick Kroll indulge in each other's improv, skewer every Broadway trope imaginable, and relish every opportunity to make the audience (or each other) uncomfortable."
Engrossing western that never got the recognition it deserved
"Although the plot coasts along a predictable path, the verbal jokes and sight gags rev things up along the way, making the film enjoyable almost from start to finish."
"The acting is uniformly on a high level. Tamblyn is impressive, and Swinton, as usual, is outstanding."
"Poas and Rodrigues rework Saint Anthony's expedition with a bold concept that seeks to express the essence of an experience, rather than its physical reality."
Brenden Fraser is outstanding in this role&#44; relatable&#44; occasionally funny&#44; and with an endless supply of optimism that is heartbreaking&#46; 
Spielberg shines with his greatest film in almost twenty years and one of the best films of 2022&#46;
"The fact that Furious 7 is messier than any of the past installments is more than mitigated by its grandeur. ""Dom, cars don't fly! Cars don't fly!"" Brian yells before its biggest stunt. Furious 7 makes you believe they can."
If it works&#44; it&apos;s thanks to a few tense sequences and lots of gore and sadistic violence that separate it from its predecessors&#46; As much as it&apos;s still a fun experience&#44; it feels like the &quot;Scream&quot; saga is running out of juice&#46; Full review in Spanish&#46;
The fact-based story it tells of instinctual heroism in the face of unspeakable horror is powerful enough to overcome its flaws.
"Let's Make Love doesn't come close to Marilyn Monroe's best moments, but those who like corny old romances could certainly do worse."
Animal Kingdom is frequently shocking - not just because it makes Air Supply's 'I'm All Out Of Love' sound cool.
"This movie feels genuine. It loves the characters, but it doesn't let them off the hook necessarily."
You'll feel the sweat dripping off your back. Thrilling beyond belief.
"Still a good movie: taut, tight, spare, invigorating. With a better filmmaker at the helm it could have been a great movie, a modern classic."
an inside perspective of what the big talents on the pedestal of major filmmaking success talk (and bitch) about.
"A story of possession wrapped up in family troubles, from abuse to incest, provides this sequel with a strong story- one of the most underrated horror sequels out there."
"What it does , quite beautifully, is make a case for a common - and borderless - humanity. The strength and love that uphold families is palpable and powerful. Be sure and stay for the credits and have a hanky ready."
"[An] enlightening documentary, which is highly recommended to any cinephile."
"Sing Your Song does three things only a superior bio-doc can do: Tell a stirring life story, place that life in the context of its times, and portray it with the kind of depth and breadth that makes you wonder why it hasn't been told before."
"As a refracted psychological portrait of longed-for motherhood, Nadine offers a revealing glimpse of a subject not often seen on the big screen."
"My favorite movie of the summer is the quiet masterpiece Leave No Trace, directed by Debra Granik."
"Ganz seems to find exactly the right pitch: His Hitler feels real and human, yet there's nothing particularly ingratiating or sentimentalized about him. We never forget who he is."
"The Truffle Hunters isn't really about the food, but far more about those who seek it out."
A WWII found footage horror movie? Yep. And it's good? Yep!
"With a fluent mix of irony and sincerity, Maoz interrogates - gently, but with unwavering insistence - the rituals of a country mired in the moral contradictions of occupation and its own defensive crouch."
It's an intriguing experience.
"The film's effect is so powerful, its timeless themes so beautifully dramatized: War is hell and senseless but inevitable; love is what binds us together and rips us apart; life is a series of accidents-both awful and joyous-waiting to happen."
"The film does shed light an another facet of Nazi history, and it does it with an attention to the complexity of human nature that makes it worthy of its Oscar win."
"Quite possibly [Spielberg's] darkest, coldest, most socially pertinent, subversive, and reactionary film to date."
"A modern-day heist thriller of unusually grim, coiled intensity ..."
"What emerges is less than an in-depth portrait of a man -- we learn little about him, aside from his intelligence, his charisma and his itch to be near power -- than a study of nationhood, history and the psychology of heroism."
...some genuinely hilarious set ups and a nice mixture of farce and other styles of comedy.
Each of the stories in Personal Velocity leaves the viewer wanting even more.
The film has one of those whip-smart screenplays that avoids just about every story-telling pitfall you can imagine spinning out of this premise.
Three Billboards is yet another shining example of McDonagh's distinguished talent as a filmmaker.
"At the very least, petrol-headed punters won't be left fuming by what whizzes past in a blur here."
"Three Times is the kind of film...that requires the viewer to make an investment, both of intellect and of time, to appreciate it."
"Occasionally loses its focus and drags, but it nonetheless remains compelling, provocative and, for the most part, emotionally resonating thanks to raw performances and a delicately woven, character-driven screenplay."
"It's a film for 2012, for the 99 per cent, for the Occupiers who have been criticised as Starbucks-quaffing smartphone revolutionaries seeking a rainbow connection that could only be called 'kermunism'."
"Bolstered by strong performances and immersive production design, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is an introspective and rewarding film from Tarantino."
"No matter what side you end up taking, you still might be tempted to call your lawyer to go over your will just one more time."
A giddy sugar-rush that slows to reveal its big charms.
"Branagh's remembrances may be idealized, but with ""Belfast"" he has written a charming, rose-tinted thank-you note to the city that sparked his dreams and the parents whose sacrifices helped them come true."
Creative Cold War Bond thriller is best for teens and up.
A cut above some of the other recent spate of Middle East-set thrillers.
"Love! Assistants! Wordplay! This film has it all-at least by the standards of a fun, disposable romantic comedy, the likes of which Hollywood rarely bothers to release anymore."
It all makes for a lean and spritely if ephemeral Minions fix.
Cooper perfectly captures the chilly terrain of the Hudson Highlands and fills the twisting story with a gothic atmosphere befitting the poet who walks within the pages&#46;
Cartel Land is a brilliantly exposed snapshot of a hugely complicated situation.
"The kind of movie whose dialogue mostly hews to the rhythms of 'like, you know, whatever' but then occasionally throws in a word such as 'puissance.' And, like, it totally works."
The animation throughout is either adorable or breathtaking.
"There's something about the cumulative effect of repeated swearing, accompanied by Thornton and Cox's delivery that turns it into comedy gold."
"It won the Audience Award at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, but don't let that be a source of dissuasion. It's actually a pretty good movie."
"The aesthetic choices and percussive pervasiveness in the score help represent Damien, the man, the podcaster and philophobic. This project is clearly a labour of love and I'm looking forward to Tyler Cole's next production."
Mix of celebrity worship and unflinching biography&#46; Well put together character study with some participants that seem intent on keeping people at arm&#8217;s length&#46; The end result is a comprehensive look that is equal parts interesting and frustrating&#46;&#10;&#10;
"At a dim time for cinema, it can rejuvenate your faith in American movies."
"It's never less than watchable, a bizarre hybrid that somehow works as a whole, even though its various components don't mesh."
"Gimmicky drive-in fare, though nobody can deliver that poem like Price."
It's [in] the intimate moments ... when And Then We Danced is at its best; full of sensuality and endless possibilities.
"Its discussion of passion and obsession, regret and reconciliation is consistently challenging and offers few easy answers."
It makes a thousand points well without any made didactically; it is simultaneously one of the angriest films I've seen this year while also being one of the quietest.
"Innovative illustration, sharp scripting and vibrant vocalising gives this sprightly animated comedy a knack for melting down the frostiest resistance."
"Leonardo DiCaprio is a nuclear bomb as Belfort, the actor basking in the ridiculousness of his surroundings and eclipsing them at every turn."
"Whether the wit fizzes or flops, a Marvel movie will always live or die by its action set-pieces. And in this latest adventure, they are truly spectacular..."
"It's cheeky and confident, maybe one of the director's finest, and its loopy final line is the cryptic cherry on this oddball gâteau."
"This is probably Rob Zombie's best film, though it does often prove that the cinephile writer/director is a gifted tyro. At the same time, as his most formally mannered and tonally tempered film, Zombie's latest also proves his versatility."
"This is an old-school independent film that won't make a zillion bucks or win major awards, but it's refreshingly honest, depicts the kinds of American lives not often seen on-screen and shows us a familiar star in a striking new light."
The whole film sizzles with urban aggression.
"The impression all of these clips in toto is of a life fully lived, of an artist who has seen much in her life and wants to share all she has learned with the rest of the world. But Cameraperson adds up to so much more than just a personal remembrance."
It's not hard to figure out why this movie has triumphed at film festivals.
"Östlund has an exquisite eye for the intimate, nonverbal communication between couples through their posture, gestures, their eyes."
The movie that is staggered by real life tragedy but refuses to be felled; it blurs the line between the world of the characters and the real world in a way that is so effective and affecting that the finale packs a humongous emotional punch.
"It should be essential viewing, particularly in high schools and universities, whence the next generation of policy makers will one day emerge, hopefully more enlightened than we have been."
This is a comedy that recognizes that the wounds inflicted during adolescence run deep and never fully heal.
"It sounds like a depressing little framework, but the actors give it life."
"Don't make your family pay for a death notice in the New York Times. ""Obit"" will inspire you to do something great, which means the paper of record will grant you a free placement."
The movie unfolds in a satisfying slow-burn that makes you feel uneasy until it takes that anxiety and turns it into pure nightmare fuel by making your worst fears real.
"A gorgeously shot, deeply interior portrait of the artist as a young introvert."
"KILL YOUR DARLINGS is really smart, but the movie never feels overly academic. It's too fun and frenzied, beautifully paced."
"Parallels to 9/11, John Ashcroft, the Patriot Act and the rest of the Bush administration's racist thuggery are obvious; the movie creates a stirring tide of activist force."
"No, these things don't all blend together well, but if you can follow Moana's island society's lead and just roll with it, you'll enjoy them one by one."
"In many ways it's a minor film, but it has some insight ..."
A not so bad bromance.
"It's an adulatory recording of the band - that's right, he adores them - but it's much more than that."
"There is something undeniably exhilarating about the film's honest assessment of the never-ending conflict between decency and cruelty that rages in every nation, neighborhood and heart."
"Producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson should be applauded for taking so many bold risks. The gosmacking ending, in fact, may be the biggest in Bond history."
"When a film covers familiar ground, as this coming-of-age story does, it had better offer an original point of view or, at the very least, interesting characters. The Art of Getting By has both, and while it loses its footing now and then, its..."
"Davis' tough, man-of-the-people narration is often annoying, but his words can't diminish the power of his story."
Shin isn't shy about laying on quirky details and oddball splashes to make his third film swing from bizarrely entertaining to dark - though the mystery-solved conclusion feels rushed and is the weakest part of the film.
"Although directed in a pop-smart style that eschews dark, deterministic melodramatics for an unsettlingly sunny tone ... the film also frustrates for having come so close to being something truly challenging."
"Washington directed as well as starred, and it is clear he has no trouble wearing both hats at once"
Burski eloquently conveys the impeccable &#40;but unpredictable&#41; alchemy of the production by underscoring&#44; with frequency&#44; how much of its brilliance was an accidental confluence&#44; how its specific magic was the right combination of people&#44; events&#44; and timing
"With talk about a sequel, it's the perfect time to return to this action-comedy..."
"This story is told with sincerity, heart, and a little bit of magic -- the very same qualities that made the original book a ""you have to read this"" classic for young girls."
The documentary is&#44; like Little Richard himself&#44; colorful&#44; humorous&#44; and wildly entertaining&#46; 
Here is a dark comedy from the great Bong Joon-Ho about class warfare that&#44; depending on your mood&#44; you may find to be a work of genius or too self-indulgent&#46; One thing is certain&#44; you&#8217;ve never seen anything quite like it&#46;
"Sometimes a movie knows you're watching it. It knows how to hold and keep you, how, when it's over, to make you want it all over again."
"A bit drawn-out, but Wasikowska and Pattinson are a giddy delight."
George Romero set a new standard for horror with this low-budget opus.
"What does homoerotic vanilla bondage have to do with you? A lot, it turns out."
"Heartwarming fact-based drama about faith, race, football."
"Carrey lights up an otherwise over-scripted, over-frenetic potboiler."
"A precise proposal that knows how to get the most out of a story with no much news in the plot, but painful and fascinating. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The characters live in a real-world of real circumstances, desires, and danger."
"Comical, colorful, wonderfully cast and beautifully animated, ""Rio"" is the first Blue Sky movie that could be compared to the best of Pixar."
"A Short Film About Killing is as grim as a motion picture gets, but the intelligence and insight applied to its themes will keep the viewer riveted despite the pervasive gloom."
Meirelles paints the squalor and misery of rural East Africa on a striking canvas - sometimes to the disservice of what he wants his film to tell us.
It's a rhapsody on the mystery of simply being alive.
Instead of relying on flashbacks&#44; Causeway lets you see and hear the trauma and raw emotions of PTSD in Jennifer Lawrence&#8217;s expressiveness&#44; physicality&#44; &amp; interactions with those around her&#46; Lawrence and Brian Tyree Henry&apos;s chemistry is off the charts&#46;
An outrageously gorgeous spectacle of balletic aggression.
"There's less than meets the eye to Joachim Trier's Reprise, but the loose, limber visual style gives the picture a certain panache."
The picture is potent and engaging; even its fictionalized elements ring with the spirit of truth.
"Whether or not there is story plausibility here, there is an emotional integrity to every reaction Maisie has to every development."
"If this is the level of arcane mischief Janiak has in store for 1978 and 1666 soon after, then consider this watcher bewitched."
"""13 Minutes"" is a superbly acted and strikingly evocative work, with careful attention to period detail and its many emotional beats."
It is still a solid - and ultimately entertaining - new spin on the beloved tale.
"...an immersive experience, aided by the absence of narration, and Ed Cortes' eclectic soundtrack is the perfect complement to the individualistic characters featured."
"What Le petit soldat, like all Godard's great films, lacks in traditional narrative or aesthetic form it more than regains in its immediacy of thought."
"But eventually, the world has to start moving again. It always does. That's what the movie is about."
Henry Selick’s first movie since 2009’s Coraline. His fifth stop-motion masterpiece.
"Creed II does not give us anything but another, slightly superior Rocky sequel. It wins on points. Just don't expect a knockout."
"I know what you're thinking, but this is no Limitless (Bradley Cooper). As the cells multiply and Lucy taps into more and more of her brain, it's new thrills-new skills with each passing hour."
"Director Fernando Meirelles tells the story with urgency, and his sharp visual compositions and washed out cinematography ooze gangster life."
"""Kajillionaire"" is a rich piece of storytelling, and it feels like a kajillion bucks."
A heartfelt story with a lovely performance from Scott Chambers.
If a bit long for a cartoon feature -- probably a sign that its makers fell in love with it -- Ratatouille is the eighth and one of the best Pixar features.
"Anchored by a charming performance from Greta Gerwig, it's as light and breezy as a walk in Central Park, and just as refreshing."
"It's largely a Hanks solo show, and the beloved icon is in fine, unfussy form."
"It is not one of those family films that will delight both children and adults alike. However, the kids will find it to be entertaining enough."
"The Amazing Johnathan Documentary is ingeniously constructed, a hilarious thrill ride and the underdog story of the year."
A little more conflict and less beatification would have made for a more insightful film.
"15 Assassins is reliably entertaining, but ultimately it's too traditional to be a classic."
The brown-bag movie of the year: Sneak in a bottle of something bitter and cheap (to match the central characters) and get smashed along with the onscreen relationship.
The quirky script is packed with good lines and off-the-wall moments and the stories are surprisingly moving in places.
"It is a model of dignified, delicate restraint but there are times when it seems to suffocate under the weight of its own sumptuous respectability."
The picture fires on all pistons.
I highly recommend you check this out on the big screen.
"Oh it's fun. An old-fashioned, good-hearted action film with a sense of humor."
"Despite its downbeat theme, A Single Man is ultimately optimistic about the human capability to gradually make peace with seemingly insurmountable pain and tragedy."
"Hersh's intelligent style turns a dialogue-heavy, potentially rote film into an enthralling and moving experience."
"It's too bad the movie never quite sweeps us up - it's slow in spots, and there's an awful lot of exposition."
What could easily have become its own figurative image of the masculine longing for freedom mines far deeper concerns.
"Mank isn’t about the incredibly tedious question of who wrote Citizen Kane —that’s the hook, but the film’s true interest, to my immense relief, is the incredibly specific story of Upton Sinclair’s failed 1934 California gubernatorial bid."
A sterling supporting cast -- down to the tiniest bit parts -- provides enough astringent intelligence to make the slobbering sentimentality go down with ease.
Enthusiastically acted and sharply written. A big old lovefest in honor of the classic alien visitation movies that we all hold near and dear.
"The Assistant is a must see, not just because it relates to the behaviour of everyone within the workplace, but because it does so without the need to preach."
It's hard to see how anyone wouldn't be absorbed by this fascinating film about a formidable driver and man.
"The Hate U Give features a strong and incredibly moving performance from Amandla Stenberg, who never holds anything back from the audience and never overplays a moment. She's a star in the making."
The film feels equally drawn out despite the bursts of black humour and the emotional depth of Fan's performance.
"We'd like to take the whole film home, to keep it and cherish its dark wit and intensity."
A seriously quirky piece of work...
An eye-opener that focuses on world-shaking events and makes you feel like you are there.
"Reenactments in documentaries are always a tricky business, but here, they feel necessary. The staged scenes communicate just how visceral mountaineering can be."
"Here, merriment and melancholy go hand in hand, partners in life's dance just as a stiff drink is an accompaniment to life's pleasures. The combination proves as intoxicating as the fancy-pants cocktails the boys whip up together."
"Even though we know the outcome...the campaign progress remains enthralling. Mostly because it's a fascinating snapshot of modern politics in flux...and a hopeful, ultimately moving account of idealism in action."
"The brothers Coen deliver a taut, vastly entertaining dissertation on the imbalance of life."
"Time to Leave blows a fresh, skeptical wind through fairly corny melodramatic territory while keeping faith with the operatic emotions of the genre."
Mild sedative filled with a good run of giggles and the frightening aim of the A-list cast. Nancy Meyers would be wise to keep corralling this type of acting pedigree. It makes her merlot-stained screenplays more palatable than they have any right to be.
A film worth seeing.
"It's a warm, if pallid, romantic comedy that may not do much more to burnish Lopez's reputation, but will certainly not bruise it."
It'll keep the kids entertained for a while and give their parents a chuckle or two along the way.
"It's a worthwhile showcase for Pacino, whose thoughtful portrayal of a washed-up stage actor is both contemplative and darkly comical."
"A stylish, frisky film that sets up the franchise deftly"
"It's a prettified view of love, for sure, but as Sox fans would surely attest, sometimes fairy tale dreams do come true."
"Beast is a strikingly shot, cleverly scripted, unsettling study of troubled psychology in the pressure-cooker claustrophobia of a small island."
"Highly recommended. In a world where the Best Animated Feature Oscar were not basically owned by Disney and Dreamworks, it would be a deserving champion."
"Inside Out's brainy script is matched both by its visual splendor, often invoking the spirit of Miyazaki, and its humanist reach, which extends to both family and (imaginary) friend alike."
"It is not a light movie (as the trailers might suggest), but it's a unique, refreshing one, driven by remarkable performances from Shawkat and Costa."
Remember the name Shohreh Aghdashloo ... she is the soul of this pungent film.
"This is a gorgeous, sweeping entertainment that combines the epic - a rain-whipped ascent through muddy hills is particularly awe-inspiring - with the intimate and the offbeat."
"A feminist chant that's necessary and relevant, a film about female empowerment and their roles in society, the work place and as human beings. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Even when the movie loses its way narratively, Washington's in there, slugging, building a living, breathing character out of Gilroy's knight-errant."
Bong Joon Ho dazzles your senses and infects your mind with a delicious concoction of artful entertainment that delivers a poignant cinematic experience. [Full review in Spanish]
"""American Sniper"" is crammed with action, heart-pounding moments and incredible gunshots by Cooper. But Eastwood seems distracted by his need to make a patriotic film more than a desire to show the real ramifications of so much killing."
"Given it could be re-titled 'Microaggressions: The Movie', this is an unsurprisingly upsetting watch at times, but it's made compelling by Vega's dignified, heartfelt performance."
"The drinks and their consumption look mighty glamorous in ""Hey Bartender,"" Douglas Tirola's tidy and ingratiating documentary ode to high-end mixologists."
"In its own, weird way it resonates, even after a story that some will see as silly and an ending that teeters on gimmicky."
"Pledge is (sometimes frustratingly) ambiguous ... I have to give it credit, though. It's a scrappy little thriller that kept me entertained and enthralled the entire time."
A travelogue with teeth.
"""Don't Look Up"" is no ""Dr. Strangelove"" in achieving lasting political satire brilliance, but it does mirror the times in which it was produced."
"Clarke's specialties are anger and violence, and he captures them with a brutal precision that belies the inherent messiness of the action."
Phil is not a challenging film but it is funny and often sweet.
"""No Time to Die"" is a terrific movie: an up-to-the-minute, down-to-the-wire James Bond thriller with a satisfying neo-classical edge."
... Guédiguian punctures a lot of myths about the face-and the motives-of the French resistance.
"A fascinating, surprisingly funny and extremely moving new documentary about the Apollo space program that really does have the right stuff."
"The Naked Gun is still very funny more than 20 years later. Leslie Nielsen is awesome, and the gags are more hit than miss."
An emotional film that connects with the audience and resembles those epic films full of sentimentalism. [Full review in Spanish]
"Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly."
"Jennifer Garner, in her first romantic comedy, sparkles in this must-see date film."
Tends to get bogged down in an over-abundance of characters and plot developments but does produce enough twists that you never feel cheated by the outcome.
It's almost immediately immersive to be here again... even if it ultimately feels like three quarters of a very good movie chopped off from a whole.
"Set in a place where the American Dream has been dead for so long that no one even thinks to question its loss, the picture features terrific performances from its game cast."
"An appealing comedy with an unabashed streak of melodrama, sharp dialogue, and a superb ensemble cast, anchored by a lead performance by Al Pacino in lovable scamp mode."
... extremely entertaining. [Full review in Spanish]
"In certain circles, it won't be for anyone. But it's as unusual and enigmatic a piece of cinema as you're likely to see this year."
"It's about a boy and his dog, and also about firefighters, and so I don't see how it's possible not to have warm feelings toward it."
"In most years, Naomi Watts would be a shoo-in for an Oscar nomination with a performance that is absolutely mesmerizing and emotionally devastating."
"A morbid, awkward, raucously funny critique of modern life."
As Leopold ... Jackman is the perfect mix of rogue and gentleman.
"A carefully constructed ride of anxiety, in which characters suffer under the voyeuristic eye of the audience and of society as a whole."
"Whatever your take on Showgirls going in, McHale's film will add new layers to it, and make you want to re-watch this fabulously bizarre flop-turned-classic with more questioning eyes."
"An ""edge"" of your seat thriller, perfect for cinephiles who find these moments of our past scintillating."
"It is such a cute movie. It's so adorable, so funny, so sweet. It's corny, but not overwhelmingly corny. It so works."
"Beautifully executed, and marks an impressive debut from Ahn."
"...Drive My Car suggests that, with the right combination of people riding together, you may be able to arrive, intact, somewhere special."
"If your tolerance for envelope-pushing crudeness and deadpan delirium allows it, this crass comedy might be just what the gastroenterologist ordered."
"The magic of “Matilda” is still strong today, and the message it sends out (“You are not alone”) is something we all need to continue to hear."
"...a sunny recollection of an 80's childhood, and specifically a love story between a boy and his aging grandmother, Minari is a feel-good movie with heart..."
Garcia delivers a nerve-jangling tour de force tryout that will be appreciated by out-of-work actors for years to come.
Bound to become THE family entertainment choice for the holiday season. It's a blockbuster. Deal with it.
Downey charms the heck out of the opportunity he's given.
Director Kevin Asch shows a skilled hand that belies his tyro status. He moves the story along briskly and to the point and gets solid performances from his talented cast.
"What to do when a relatively small, modest budgeted urban comedy becomes a massive critical and word-of-mouth hit? Make a sequel to cash in on the phenomenon, of course. It is the Hollywood way, after all..."
"A film that is oh-so enchanting and charming thanks to eye-popping visuals, perfect voice casting and a fantastical story for all ages."
A sinister tapestry of urban unease and feminist fury that turns an ordinary domestic setting into a place of skulking terror. Original and deeply creepy.
Jia Zhangke creates atmospheres and images of great poetic breath that are full of suggestive power and meaning. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Truly romantic movies seem to be a rarer and rarer thing in contemporary cinema and, like Max Ophüls and Jacques Demy before him, Wright is almost peerless in his ability to make an audience swoon and suffer in maximalist splendor."
"Long, lyrical takes - including a startling shot of a floating funeral procession - and Schubert's 'Death And The Maiden' on the soundtrack remind us that forbidden passion will only end in tears. The Danube's rarely seemed so blue."
"In the main, Jaume Collet-Serra is making a character-driven drama about betrayed honor, and the result is a film closer in spirit to the baggage-rich crime novels of Dennis Lehane than dumb multiplex fare."
"It might not be perfect, but this ""Papillon"" definitely has wings."
"A charming, quietly satisfying work, Adam is a commendable film. Sensitively written and directed by Mayer, it's given shape and dimensionality by Dancy, who delivers a tremendous performance that lends the film genuine humanity."
"Thrillingly paced, ravishingly shot and eerily topical, Sicario 2 retains much of its predecessor's dark charm despite its shuffled creative personnel. But a jarringly Hollywood ending dulls its overall impact."
"Hall, making his feature debut, rarely strays from the underdog sports movie template, but the two appealing young leads come as a welcome blast of deodorant to this stale narrative armpit."
"Mary and The Witch's Flower is a colorful and visually stunning spectacle, a film that packs plenty of detail within its frames."
"In truth, mother! can be about whatever you want it to, making it one of those rare films that you can appreciate without actually having to enjoy any second..."
"It's a fierce performance, not because Rodriguez is a seasoned actress -- she's not -- but because she brings such a magnificent, 'prove-it-to-me' snarl to the role."

The actors' hammy performances only compound the amusement of watching a dynasty propped up by largesse fall to pieces at the very thought of actually having to earn their way in life.

"Alas, the out-on-the-town portion of the movie is less engaging, although if you're a Smiths fan you can happily rock out to the greatest-hits soundtrack, which has everything from the title track to Panic, Girl Afraid and How Soon Is Now."
The performances are great from top-to-bottom...this was a movie that probably should have been on the big screen.

As much a loving homage to the horror genre as it is a lament for a civilization on the brink.
"Amin's story is so thick with drama, terror and bloodshed, why create a fictional character to serve as a vantage point?"
"It's a gorgeous, thoughtful, well-acted, morally complex and adult-skewing character study from a major studio. Warts and all, it's exactly what we say Hollywood never bothers to make."
"Joseph Hader breathes life into his role with a raw, understated performance that somewhat compensates for the screenplay's lack of emotional depth."

English film that powerfully and practically speaks to the communal dimension of our responsibility to the natural world.

"The most ambitious and impressive Coen film in at least a decade, featuring the flat, sun-blasted landscapes of west Texas and an eerily memorable performance by Javier Bardem."

Fresh transitions from simmering romance to boiling carnage and in doing so becomes a deliciously moreish movie morsel.

"When the visit ends, one is grateful simply to have been in their esteemed company."
"More than a decade after The Blair Witch project turned the mock-doc format into a horror cliche, this low-tech horror show uses it to chilling effect in this story of cynicism vs. things that go bump in the night."

Law's committed performance is the biggest selling point for the inconsistent movie.
The imagery on display is amazing&#44; and its power frequently overtakes the screenplay&#46;

An almost unimaginably thrilling experience.
"A bespectacled, bow-tie wearing beagle with a genius IQ and a penchant for terrible puns... Erudite, pedantic, prissily formal, he sounds a lot like Niles from Frasier but he'd make a great Dog-tor Who."
Writer/director Jason Orley's debut is funny ... but it's also surprisingly insightful about why these characters do the things they do and let it get so out of control...
"At the end of the day, while unnecessary, ""Army of Thieves"" thrives because Schweighöfer's go-for-broke attitude pushes this overlong, low-stakes, heist caper into the realm of enjoyability."
"Although Hall's impressive debut is about very specific people in a particular place and time, the questions it raises and the experiences it dramatizes are broader, more universal."
An absolutely heartbreaking tearjerker...
"...a brilliant, precise cast. [Full Review in Spanish]"

"Even though it's not exactly easy to watch the protracted deaths of two children, this is not only one of the greatest anime ever, but also an important (anti-) war film. A moving masterpiece."
"Here, Jeunet’s bright colors and prankish manipulation of space makes a suburban home and its lookalike environs an appropriate carnival atmosphere. Big Bug turns a spiritual and political pandemic into a three-dimensional funhouse mirror."
The story sets out to be that whimsical escapist romance with a European setting where love and heartbreak span decades in that mystery format. Director Augustine Frizzell pulls out all the stops at making this film the unabashed epic romance that it is.

Yonebayashi's unwavering faith in the clear values and direct narrative structures of a good storybook energize his rousing entertainment with sweep and drive.
"Synthetic outdoor backdrops look oddly out of place in some scenes, but the show happily brims with gusto and melody. Howard Keel and Jane Powell top the cast."
It's only when the giddiness passes that you realise you've witnessed not only an incredible true story but a fitting tribute to an unforgettable landmark.

"By the time the film gets where it's going, viewers may identify more than they expect with those who've been controlled by others with hidden agendas."

"Happily is a dark comedy with an all-star cast of characters, building tension in a wound up house of deception, boiling over into a wild and weird getaway."
What makes Depp so incredible as an on screen presence is his generosity. He hardly commands the screen as much as he shares it with his co-stars.
There&#8217;s nothing didactic about &#8216;T&#225;r&#44;&#8217; nor any simple moral you can hashtag or put on a bumper sticker&#46; The film is complicated&#46; Difficult&#46; Much like its protagonist&#46;
"Detachment is a powerful, incisive and emotionally stirring film that provides keen insight into an over-saturated topic."
"Django is infectiously rousing and exuberantly subversive. Say what you will about his insensitivities, nothing in Tarantino's approach is condescending or pretentious."
I've been sold on the rich possibilities of these new movies. I'm letting the Force in this time.
A compelling report.

...a surprisingly touching drama about finding that balance between our past and present selves.
A medley of familiar Christmas classics...with a distinct Muppet spin.

Ace in the Hole does for print media what Network and Nightcrawler would do later on for television and it still rings true today.

Steven Spielberg's best movie in at least a decade.
Explores with creative and comic energy the difficulties of the sibling bond and the mixed feelings we often have for those who share our history.
"Walt Disney has no peer in the field of animated features and his latest, based on the familiar King Arthur legend, is brimming with mirth, music and magic."

An essential documentary that helps explain today's politics (and perhaps tomorrow's) around the world. [Full Review in Spanish]

This is the kind of intimate little indie that I wish we got more of.

"Haunting and ominous, written, directed and acted nearly to perfection."
"Deftly directed by Stephen Frears, the film is funnier than you might expect. The opening sequence alone is a mini masterpiece of pacing. And Dench gets to show enormous range."

"Like 'The Lord of the Rings,' 'Spider-Man' is grandly, emotionally affecting in a way that it had started to seem that Hollywood blockbusters never would be again."

"Quincy is lovingly put together and recounts one of the most distinguished and interesting careers in American entertainment. However, it's almost too much to fit into a single movie."
"This sequel to the Kingsman: The Secret Service (based on the comicbook series) veers in several directions, but the last half hour when things come together, more than makes up for the wait."

Impressive scary indie horror pic.

"We're invited to contemplate the torments of mental instability and the awful intimacies of family life, as well as whatever malignant forces may lurk behind the veil of everyday existence."

Logan is a dark and thrilling finale for Wolverine. Director James Mangold brings stark realism to the comic genre.

"What remains is a fascinating, Kafkaesque portrayal of justice (or lack thereof) in modern China, but it's no knee-slapper and, at more than two hours, it's long for a comedy."
An eerie and intimate psychological thriller with Hitchcockian tones harkening back to the Shyamalan's early 2000s run that put him on the filmmaking map.
"A round of hide and seek with some blue bloods gets, well, bloody in the very funny horror-satire Ready or Not."
"To a tale which is, happily, naughty but nice about love and marriage and set with wistful witty tunes and recitatives, Vincente Minnelli adds his own special touch of sophistication and burlesque at the expense of the period's fashions and manners."
"Funny, sad and bittersweet - one of Noah Baumbach's finest."
Writer/director Thomas Robert Lee's The Curse of Audrey Earnshaw ... doesn't do much new but does present its story with a strong command of mood.
"A tale of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy."
It&#8217;s been years &#8212; maybe as far back as &#8220;All the President&#8217;s Men&#8221; in 1976 &#8212; that a movie has captured the craft and the passion of journalism as precisely and as smartly as director Maria Schrader&#8217;s &#8220;She Said&#46;&#8221;
"Love and Honor is a welcome affirmation of Yamada's determination to maintain his historic workload, even while in his 70s."
"A magnetic, brilliant and captivating film where the director knows how to tense the threads that unite the imagination of the spectator with the imagery of distant worlds. [Full review in Spanish]"
The charm of Hey Arnold lies in its wacky characters who delight by their off-beat kooky humour in this David and Goliath story about saving the neighbourhood.
"I could not possibly care less about football, and I fell hopelessly in love with this movie, and with the can-do amateur team it introduces us to."
"While it lacks outright Cronenbergian pleasures, ""Maps to the Stars"" repeatedly connects as a dark comedy and insidious display of rancid human behavior."
Strangely inert and lifeless.
Johnstone&#8217;s film revels in the humor of its premise complete with pop songs and children&#8217;s toys gone awry&#46;
A striking phantasm of affection&#44; regrets&#44; and remembered accounts that might be factually inaccurate but emotionally unfeigned&#46;
"Disney's multi-Oscar nominated musical is not as good as Mary Poppins to which it's often compared, but Angela Lansbury is well-cast and most of the visual effects, which won the Oscar, are impressive."
"Green concocts a series of deliciously telling moments of behavior or lines of dialogue, and a game cast and crew are equal to the offbeat content."
"Eastwood takes the film in some interesting directions by sticking to documented facts, zeroing in on Richard's reluctant decision to fight back against the system he loves..."
"Each time the script wobbled into cliché, I cringed. The actresses are too talented to flail on hallucinogens. But they launch into idiocy with so much energy that even the dumbest scenes lift-off."
"The outrage of actor-turned- writer-director Peter Mullan is palpable, and every frame of this shocking and occasionally exploitative film is designed to ensure that this reaction is contagious."
"Williams delivers a solid, twinkle-free (though closed-off) performance, but the film as a whole can't decide what it wants to be."
A passable yet underwhelming sequel...
"It will make you feel wonderful, and if you're like me, whose emotional barometer responds in the positive with tears, take plenty of tissues."

"Granted, this is hardly the jolliest way to see in the new year but it functions as an educational tool."
One of the most gorgeous and sophisticated portraits of an artist ever put on film.
"If you've been waiting a long time for the next in-your-face sensation in the Pulp Fiction tradition, check out Sin City."

Deliciously macabre... Nightcrawler is popcorn snuff.
A complex film about the minefield of loyalty and betrayal.
"Gabriela Cowperthwaite imbues the film with enormous compassion for its characters and the lead actors, especially Segel, bring endless warmth and humanity to their roles."
The first 'must see' movie of the year.
Princess of Tides

"The fugitive and his pursuer are both given attention by the script, which is careful to develop characters that are intelligent, insightful, and, most of all, entertaining."
A tremendous film&#46; Something that looks at a hard topic like depression in a very beautiful and human way&#46; 
"Scandi-noir takes a supernatural turn in Joachim Trier's creepy, erotic thriller."
"Is it possible to recommend a movie based on a single scene alone? If it's The Forbidden Kingdom, the answer is an obvious ""Yes."""
"Production designer Anna Falgures and cinematographer Jeanne Lapoirie expertly capture the town-and-country contrasts, while De France and Higelin boldly commit to their challenging, if underwritten roles."
Palm Springs builds on the concept's legacy by using it to examine negotiations between two people instead of a path for self-betterment.

"We finally have a popular biopic that young LGBTQ people can sample, and embrace or reject based on their own views and needs."
"Despite the chaos of the mixed genres and the strange narrative, The Five Devils still has standout moments. Dramé is exquisite as the precocious Vicky."
A perplexing but all-too-human psychological drama ...
"An absorbing, rewatchable drama that quietly told loud truths, and wore its anger remarkably lightly."
"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari illustrates something more eternal: about great manipulators, and the underlying anxiety that either society has gone mad, or we have."
"Jennifer Lopez is outstanding as Selena, lending ability and grace to the stage numbers, in particular, but throughout the film, in general."
[Hugh] Grant is a hoot throughout as he channels vintage Michael Caine for equal parts menace and camp.
"""The Beguiled"" probably could've benefited from a little more energy in its telling. Still, Coppola offers some gorgeous images of the past made present."
... an enjoyably frothy 'date movie'...
Khaou carefully constructs each scene for maximum impact-intentional repetition expressing the experience's ever-changing evolution.
"An upsetting film..if you're looking for a film that shoves you way out of your comfort zone, this one will do the trick."
"'Don't Come Knocking' is about traversing landscapes of memory. Even as the American Dream is fading in the open, once empty, surreal western landscapes now strewn with the detritus of an entirely disposable material society, so too the western-movie hero"
It could have been called What a Girl Actually Has.
As a snapshot of an age and life stage&#44; Trier helms a film that&apos;s canny and incisive&#44; also perfects the sensation of constantly zipping onwards even when it seems as if you&apos;re stuck&#44; and knows how to find both joy and darkness in tandem&#46;
"Sang-ho can't quite resist a last-minute lurch towards sentimentality, but for the most part he keeps this moveable feast for the undead on track with relentless and bloody carnage."
"With the extraordinary Hoffman doing double duty as director, this film -- with its incisive look at the fragile women and benumbed men of NYC's lost army of loners -- is one of the best of 2010."
"The Rock and Emily Blunt knock themselves out to entertain in this dopey, derivative, theme-park ride of a movie. But, hey, the kids will love it and like the Metallica thrasher that bizarrely shows up on the soundtrack, ""nothing else matters."""
A meditative Western that focuses on the spiritual transformation of a female settler into a leader as she journeys West in a covered wagon caravan.
"This, Albert's voice, is what separates this piece from reports from other publications - those minute details spoken with such a nostalgic, heartfelt cadence, being revisited in the present, never spoken on screen beforehand."
"Gringo gets a lot of mileage out of its energy, its ability to use cruelty as a motivational tool rather than just as a way of belittling others, and its copious amounts of creative violence."
"Thriller about brothers has realistic violence, language."
"""The Signal"" is a sci-work of thoughtful hints and feints, but the movie's big reveal raises as many questions as it answers."
"What Days offers is an incredibly realistic, near-documentarian sketch of two ordinary lives that informs you of the characters' circumstances and emotional state without telling you anything."
"We are definitely on familiar, well-travelled ground, which explains why the visually impressive Reminiscence is good but falls well short of great."
"At the movie's climax, they [the actors] bring new life to liberte, egalite and, of course, fraternite."
"A sweet, quickly told story and very good writing makes it very easy to love I Love You, Man. Another plus: it's not produced, written or directed by Judd Apatow."
"It's best to approach Find Me Guilty as a showcase for Diesel, who is finally beginning to prove he's more than the next-generation Van Damme."
Count 'Camp' as the rarity it is: a modern movie that's funny and sweet.
"...the career of consumer advocate Ralph Nader, in an adoring hagiography..."

A pleasantly nonsensical roller-coaster ride.
Wonderful book adaptation with strong female character.
The beauty of this adaptation of Belgian author and illustrator Gabrielle Vincent's characters is its sheer simplicity and sincerity.

"May be a frustrating film for viewers looking for a straight piece of historical fiction...This is no photograph, but an impressionistic sketch of the communicability of evil - and in that respect it's a powerful piece of filmmaking."
"Katie Dickie gives an astonishing performance as Jackie, displaying a cold, brittle exterior that occasionally cracks to reveal both pain and passion in equal measure."
"Reeves nails Batman's raison d'etre. The personal grievance, married to intimate violence, is satisfying."
"Tangerine unostentatiously celebrates fluidity, community, support and is generally quite hearteningly right-on..."
"It's a combination of nostalgia, good vibes and even a bit of ""you can't reheat a soufflé,"" but if you loved the first one you'll connect to this sequel. Wesley Snipes is rad!"
"Sure, the closer you get the more it has a cubic-zirconia feel, costume jewelry instead of the real thing, but, hey, it's a plenty breezy diversion here in the latter days of this seemingly unending winter."
Anderson skillfully dissects the idea of the New York intellectual bourgeoisie and examines the growing void between families.
"Clearly, del Toro has a deep affection for both his characters and the world of gods and fairy-tale monsters, and it translates into a rich, sophisticated sequel that actually improves on the original."
"Blow the Man Down is a strong showcase for older female character actors. In most movies, performers like Squibb, Martindale and O'Toole would maybe get to steal a few scenes. Here, they're the main attraction."
Spike Lee using his white voice - for subversive purposes.
Features a great performance from the Danish actor Jesper Christensen.
Need escape? Logan Lucky is for you.
"Battle scenes are infused with a propulsive sense of urgency, as Bradley (a vet stunt coordinator and second unit director) often achieves an effective semi-documentary look."
A tender and exquisite animation about one man and his dog which gets as close to what it is to love dogs as I've ever encountered.
Erguven's assured direction seals the deal. There's a mythical quality to this tale of burgeoning female sexuality that transcends the more hackneyed elements of the plot and marks her out as a director to watch.
A truly F'ed up thriller and aesthetic experience.
"This film bites with all of its teeth. It's an exercise in a certain level of brutality that we seem to reserve for those we know the best -- our family, our friends, our neighbors."
It's wicked and cynical and I suspect Hollywood will want to remake it but will strip out its acidic nature.
"Exquisite on every level, Dreamchild is a film to cherish."
"It feels like one of those live-action Disney features that were so prevalent during the 1970s -- one could easily picture Jodie Foster as the prepubescent heroine, Dean Jones as her bumbling uncle, and Don Knotts as the supremely self-satisfied villain."
"Among the more unique, one-of-a-kind movies of the year. And I'd love to see a where-are-they-now sequel in a few years."
Godzilla Vs Kong delivers action and spectacle by the bucket load and will leave anyone who wants to see a giant ape hit a giant lizard in the face with an axe very satisfied&#46;
"The movie's ending will not satisfy everyone, but it does avoid typical Hollywood conventions. Whether it is the correct finale is something you will have to search your own heart to answer."
"An Inconvenient Sequel comes close to sanctifying Gore; while he says he sometimes views the lack of global progress on climate change as ""a personal failure,"" the film never encourages us to agree with him."
A United Kingdom never sacrifices its narrative in favor of making a statement and it rarely resorts to sermonizing.
"One of the most technically impressive films of its time, and one of the most politically naive."

"There are worse ways to spend two hours than in the company of ""Snow White and the Huntsman."""
"As a record of the Al Franken you already know and love, Hegedus and Doob's rather slapdash movie is fun."

"[Alexander] Payne is aided greatly by [George] Clooney, whose befuddled expressions should be engraved in the cement at Grauman's Chinese."
"At its heart, Shazam is a movie about making your own family, bridging the gap differences seem to make, and having a good laugh while you do."
The tone of the movie is cheerily macabre.
"A cross-generational character comedy whose biggest problem is its characters, Noah Baumbach's While We're Young is sharply observed but frustratingly slight."
1960s-set family drama tackles weighty issues.
Oakley has crafted a sad and shrewd film about the loneliness of hiding your true self and the inherent evils of compulsory heterosexuality&#44; especially under the guise of &#8220;protecting children&#46;&#8221;
"It generates its chills simply, by presenting an unnatural and uncanny situation in very human terms."

"A lickety-split, madly packed, roller-coaster entertainment that might almost have been designed to make you scared of how much smarter your kids are than you."
An intriguing tale that twists and turns in some unexpected ways.
"Director, Scott Hicks has created a really lovely film. It's fortunate that the star power of Clive Owen gives the film a core dynamism."
"... The film’s writer-director, Colm Bairéad, shows how a well-judged movie can come near to corniness but still be deeply poignant. "
"For casual race fans, Racing Dreams is a real eye-opener. And it's a darned entertaining way to get a handle on a sport that can seem like a bunch of cars doing circles for a crowd that seems most interested in seeing that next epic wreck."
"It's essentially a soundtrack -- and a good one at that, led by Timberlake and Anna Kendrick, with contributions from Gwen Stefani -- in search of a story."
"Though not without striking qualities by itself, it serves best as a poignant stepping stone to the auteur's later, more famous projects."
"A twisty, chilly vision of haute-yuppie parenting as unrelenting nightmare, an ingenious reworking of the demon-seed genre in which the evil child is not the real villain."
"A goofball riff on the pirate-movie genre, this sequel is as insubstantial as popcorn -- and as delicious."
"Cloying smart, gleefully mischievous and resplendently, stupendously gross."
"Not Okay is like many “internet movies” before it – approaching uncanny valley, somewhat obvious, just a little off — but this unsettling darkness makes it a solid entry into the canon of just-okay social media films."
I'll Sleep When I'm Dead may take its place with Get Carter as a classic British gangster film.
It's a very sly piece of filmmaking.
"This is the arid equivalent of Werner Herzog's Aguirre, Wrath of God. Reichardt offers the minimum of genre conventions and none of the genre's satisfactions or resolutions."
"Any frustration is neutralized whenever Krieps is onscreen. The actress plays Chris as beguilingly childlike, her feelings and impulses... right at the surface, intensifying and subsiding, arpeggio-like."
"Enraging, and eye-opening, the beginning of the antidote for how black women's lives get erased in America. Tells a story that we should recognize as epic."
The film can jar when oscillating between the CG-realised worlds and sequences with actors playing non-Na&#8217;vi characters&#44; but for the most part The Way of Water is a sumptuous visual tapestry&#46;

"Transcendent and absorbing, depicting our place in the universe with ferocious honesty and unflinching strength."
"The Sacrament is worth a watch for fans of the director and cast, but its lack of purpose or anything to say limits its staying power dramatically."
"Wong made Chungking in just 23 days, and the film's mad-dash energy is nicely reflected in his quartet of stars. Wong, himself a star of cinema's future, has already shown that he possesses a uniquely '90s voice, eye and spirit."

Deep Impact hits the bull's eye for sci-fi action thrills and the sheer power of an engrossing adventure that marries plausible ideas with a jump into the beyond.
"Though it may seem Biller is mountain an assault on delightfully garish exploitation fare - with overemphatic titles like ""Vixen!"", ""Score!"" and ""The Lickerish Quartet"" - that's not quite what she's doing."
"Suffers the same problems that most sitcom to movie adaptations suffer from, but fans of the series should find lots to love."
"The satire's still there, albeit not as angry and more obvious, and the targets have shifted. It may not have the original's subversive nutso attitude but there's a couple of crazy surprises up its sleeve and a surprisingly engaging story."
A feat of photography.
"Corseted courtesies and the candlelit rooms with their flickering pools of light never overwhelm the story's contemporary resonance. The clash of male assumption and jealousy, and female wiles and independence, has no shortage of present-day parallels."
"A thoroughly enjoyable film with a lot to like about it, even if you're not a fan of 'The Boss.'"
"Be it Panda-Rific, Perfectly Panda or Panda-monium, one thing is for certain when we're talking about Kung Fu Panda 3 - It's the Best.Panda.Ever."
"Efficient, well-crafted and solid to a fault, The Finest Hours might have been made 30 or 70 years ago, and starred Gary Cooper or James Stewart -- it's profoundly old-fashioned but pretty enjoyable for all that."
"This is meaty, dramatic stuff - see this movie with your teenagers and watch their jaws hit the floor -- and the filmmakers cannily use President Nixon's secret tapes to bolster their case..."

"Well before the 80 minutes are up, most parents will probably tune out, but the little kids will surely feel like they are inside one fantastic candy store."
"It's a fascinating puzzle: a film that is simultaneously an indictment of the toxic legacy of cultural imperialism and a weepie that employs the familiar tropes of Hollywood, one of the biggest machines of cultural imperialism on the planet."
What's funny about exploitation? You'd be amazed.
"One of the two very smart things that the film does is to keep the original 1975 setting, as the story would have been altered far too much to be set in the digital age."
"Clooney is remarkable in Alexander Payne's film about loss, confusion and getting by."
"Republican, Democrat, or Independent, the only side THE REPORT chooses is the fight for human rights."
"The intelligence and wit of this glass-slipper heart-of-gold fantasy are shocking too, but hell hath no part of the surprise.  "
The film isn't full of revelations but it's playful and makes trees look very huggable indeed.
"Gomez-Rejon's classic-slasher-update finds a unique way to repurpose Charles B. Pierce's original material, creating a sequel/remake hybrid that's fun enough for some cheap date night scares."
A fun story for the whole family -- with some very good lessons about growing up.
"Over-hyped... But you will laugh out loud at the chutzpah and the kiddie DIY problem-solving it took to do a shot-by-shot remake of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"""
"Oferecendo uma das melhores atuações de sua brilhante carreira, Bogart cria um indivíduo assustadoramente ambíguo, enquanto Grahame ilustra com talento o conflito emocional de sua personagem."

"Labaki's realistic camera following Zain, whose family is undocumented migrants, takes viewers into the heart of a very real, universal issue, no, not about refugees, but the problem of unfit parenting."
"Ostensibly a comedy about inspiration and creativity, The Muse is a clunker that's actually painfully lacking in both qualities."
"[Abdel] Kechiche knows his subject and the film reflects the warmth and understanding with which he views it, though it is inordinately long at 2 hrs and 30 minutes."
"Shows that it's not only possible to make a spine-tingling World War II saga without bloodshed, but also to use such stories to examine the agonizing-but-necessary values of conscience, loyalty and forgiveness."
"An attractive, energetic young cast and some witty, off-center visual humor make the resultant laughs more than worth the wait."
"With so many ideas in play, the film is never dull. Sometimes it's also funny, perceptive and nuanced. Things get deeper and dirtier as it rolls on, but not really clearer, in terms of purpose."
"Mary Poppins Returns is solid, reliable family fare and only the hardest heart will leave the cinema bereft of a smile. It might not be another classic, but it's brolly good fun."
"It's a film that is very much in the tradition of British social realism. Nonetheless, it remains light and joyful enough to be enjoyed and recognised by an audience with the same demographic and age as the characters on screen."
"While watching ""Gold,"" I felt I had seen the story before. And, I realize that I had, many times and ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" comes to mind - without Bogey and bandits that ""don't need no stinking badges."""
"For me, Ferrara and Keitel will always be the bad lieutenant, but Werner Herzog is probably the only director qualified to take this on, and his bizarre reboot has a fascination all of its own."
"What it all amounts to is a tremendously funny feel good film that doesn't quite stand on its own so much as it plays as a great (the BEST, really) companion-piece to The Room that a cult film fan could ask for."
The film set a strong tone for modern summer blockbuster films in 1993 and continues to be one of the most iconic movies ever to hit a silver screen in the summer months.
a cheerfully silly caper comedy that mixes in a little of 'My Fair Lady' and a lot of 'The Honeymooners' as it breezes along. ...Allen and Tracey Ullman spar and slander each other with an almost maniacal glee.
"Nicely composed and played with an endearing sense of Hitchcockian humour, Grand Piano is well worth a tinkle."
Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium should delight audiences in the mood for holiday magic.
"Writer-director Chloe Zhao works methodically to set up Johnny's situation, while also capturing in poetic detail the dead-end lives of poverty, alcoholism and hopelessness on the reservation."

"Disturbia doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is, and thank goodness for that."
"We all need a little mindless entertainment every now and then, and Rampage certainly fits the bill."

"Rocketman  is a cannily honed machine, absolutely sure of its purpose, so you rather feel you've been sold a complete deluxe package... at times, consumer satisfaction is taken care of a little too aggressively for you to really feel involved."
This British import is a good-natured comedy featuring several laugh-out-loud sequences.

"The plot is ludicrous but one doesn't go to Luc Besson action films for character-driven storytelling; they go for exactly what this film promises and delivers -- frenetic, inspired, grin-inducing action."
"What struck me in now is that it eschews the plot, and going off into flights of comic fancy including re-doing the ending a couple times until theyre satisfied. The result is still funny, still EXCELLENT and SCHWING! Two on-air reviews in one link! "
"If these movie cops were your local police, you'd want them strung up on charges and locked away. In a fictionalized past, sure, it's still amoral, but that would only be a problem if the movie ever took itself seriously."
"A streamlined, ""Reader's Digest"" version of real-life events. However, it is a gorgeous, worthwhile re-telling thanks to a fine cast; top-notch art direction; a beautiful, mostly piano score by Stephen Warbeck; and Gabriel Beristain's ravishing cinematog"
"It's entirely ridiculous, but it gallops cheerfully along; everything is carried off with flair and ingenuity."
"There's enough juice to sustain a fan's interest for awhile. It ain't much, but watching Scully and Mulder inch closer romantically, and seeing some cool special effects is worth the price of admission."
"As comfort-blanket romcoms go, it is the rare one that will not bring you out in a rash."
"A languorous, visually striking movie about love and loss, infused with the earnestness of young people struggling with powerful emotions and with evolving ideas about life, death, art, freedom and responsibility."

"Although “When You Finish Saving the World” is... taut with unhappiness, it allows itself to be funny..."

&#91;Newell and Attanasio&#93; pay as much attention to emotional details as to the clockwork details of mob life&#46;

"In a swift 86 minutes, director Meadows and co-writer/star Considine give us a methodical, handsome, emotionally intelligent version of the revenge flick."
"Its mock-artistic thriller trappings notwithstanding, 'In Bruges' is basically a funny, tragicomic two-hander, with the casting of Farrell alongside Gleeson enabling a pleasing Irish inflection."
"A competent genre movie enlivened by vivid sense of place/culture - shot on location in New Orleans, delving into the world of merchant seaman/dock workers/smugglers."
"Treating his seafood substantially better than Oldboy, Jiro is a miracle of perfectionism married to expertise. The same can said for Gelb's loving documentary."
Franciosi grabs the film by its shoulders and turns it into a searing&#44; singular experience&#46;
A slick weepie made by smart guys who want you to know they're better than the schlockmeisters.
A totally absorbing movie.
A non-stop action fest.
Good but not great. Streep and Roberts feel a little too much like stunt-casting.
"Broader and more accessible than either Shaun Of The Dead or Hot Fuzz, Paul is pure Pegg and Frost - clever, cheeky and very, very funny."
Skyfall returns Bond to Solid Ground
"Pitt's ridiculous, wildly over-the-top performance somehow keeps it all together."

"Despite the director's smarmy narration and interviews, the bemused equanimity of these folks who've seen it all could inspire each of us to what ""we can can"" do as we age."
Director Igal Hecht has pulled together a compelling film about an extraordinary man. There are moments of true heartbreak and tragedy mixed with wild road stories and the Iron Sheik's trademark over-the-top personality.
It's both gorgeous enough and emotionally engaging enough to be worth seeking out.
"There are lots of lovely touches, including animated sequences (the film is based on a graphic novel) and Powley is terrific - funny and wise beyond her years."
"Extraordinary...not only an engrossing first-hand account of Israel's Palestinian policies over time, but one that may have lessons to teach both Israeli leaders and other nations confronting those they identify as terrorists."
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a mind-blowing visual and mental extravaganza that leaves you in utter awe...
"It might not supplant ""It's a Wonderful Life"" in the pantheon of required December viewing, but I recommend giving it a spot in your holiday rotation."
"The perfect conversation starter, and a great way for people unable (or unwilling) to understand the trans struggle to see it from a fresh, new perspective."
"It's a surprisingly epic and spirited film, driven by an adventurous spirit and enough clever fun to keep things fresh during a sometimes long-winded ride."
"Anderson eloquently blends these characters together for a tantalizing seriocomic medley. He keeps his proceedings glossy and tantalizing, while steady and harshly real."
"""The animation was beautiful, the storyline set in place, telling a tale of how traditions and cultures can work presently to unite us all."""
"The film is one of those rare beasts, with a sense of genuine permanency. It beds down in your mind, like it is preparing to live there for a while. It is not pretty, but it is, sometimes, very beautiful."
One of 2022&apos;s 20 best films&#46;
"At 89, Morenos petite frame still radiates star charisma and vitality. Viewers will come away from this film feeling like Moreno didnt just live life; she earned it."
"Linney and Grace play off one another beautifully, her reticent better judgment collapsing in equal proportion to his ironic detachment."
"Love it or hate it, you won't be able to leave it alone."

Masaki Kobayashi&#8217;s &#8220;Harakiri&#8221; illustrates the samurai code as a flawed system hiding behind a fa&#231;ade of honor and principle&#8212;it is undeniably the greatest anti-samurai film ever made&#46; 
Even Cecil B. DeMille might have been impressed.
"If you want a film that is big and true and tough, go see Synecdoche. And then go see it again, because it's so rich with ideas that you can't possibly get them all the first time around."
Amalric&#8217;s emotional mystery&#44; as its fragments and enigmas unfold&#44; isn&#8217;t necessarily a journey for viewers to solve but rather a state of mind to understand&#58; the bewitchingly poignant story of a woman&#8217;s fertile&#44; possibly perilous&#44; coping mechanism&#46;
"Stunning visuals and imagery, exceptional directing, and stellar performances by all the cast members make this the can't miss movie of the year."
"Entertaining and well acted, but redundant and a bit machinelike."
[A] satirical tableau of a Poland that does not recognize itself. [Full review in Spanish]
"Taking the long view that Winner's case is hardly an aberration, the director seems to inhabit the role of whistleblower as well, upending an ongoing narrative put forth by those outside the government that continues to see that true justice isn't served."
The Wayans are the masters of spoof.
intelligent and moving
"A loving paean to Bond, Flint, Helm and their ilk (as well as a myriad of outlandish villains), the film knows its turf and only missteps when it ventures into more contemporary territory."
"Whether it's ""Alex Rider,"" ""Agent Cody Banks"" or ""Spy Kids,"" plenty have tried to adapt the 007 shtick to younger characters, with demonstrably dopey results. In the end, the reason it works for Vaughn is that he's making the film for adults."
"The filmmakers have created an intensely stark and visceral representation of this hellish place, and the cinematography is intimate and stunning."
Decent 70s thriller.
"Girl Asleep might be about an awakening, but it's not a sexual awakening, and this is one teen comedy in which, at long last, the geek doesn't get the girl."
"Boasting a clever title, this is an inspired piece of lunacy about sociology versus biology, with terrific performances from Ben Stiller and his two sets of parents."
"Splice went down smooth, with its sleek surfaces, terrific special effects and disturbing sexiness."
"The Christian-themed drama God Bless the Broken Road wears its earnest heart on its sleeve, and isn't afraid to show it."
"What's special about the film is how much we come to know Frankie, perhaps more than he knows himself."
"After a muddled beginning, the deliberately paced film ties together its characters and disparate genre elements in mostly unexpected ways."
Engaging without relying on blockbuster bravado.
"Mostly, you'll just have to take my word for it that Spider-Man: Far From Home is a damned delight."
"Don't get me wrong, Spider-Man is no instant classic, but as summer blockbuster entertainment, you're not apt to find much better"
"THE PIANIST is Polanski's most personal work to date, and perhaps because of that, Polanski seems to have rediscovered the cinematic voice he had as a young man."
A pleasure. [Full review in Spanish]
"At least Ratner knows how to handle both action and drama on screen, even if subtlety and substance fall by the wayside."
Judging it by itself as a solo slasher film from 2018 it aced it... as a sequel it did even better.
Pfeiffer is outstanding.
"The directors jump into an impoverished, fast-moving life, and never attempt to put on the brakes for the sake of providing audience comfort."
Micmacs is eccentric ecstasy.   [Full review in Spanish] 
"If Rat Film is a maze, then it's one that offers rewards at every turn."
... a quietly moving story of resilience.
"It is an inspirational, heart-tugging story of the kind Oscar might be willing to embrace."
"The knifelike story gets a little dull, but its ending still manages to sting."
"William Wayne, who wrote, directed, produced, edited, and stars in the film...clearly had a vision for the movie."
"Menashe may be a film of understated storytelling and plot, but its pleasures lie primarily in the wonderfully observational approach that Weinstein takes to his protagonist."
"Director Lee Chang-dong has complete mastery of the tone here and he gets great, subtle performances from his cast."
"Director Ryusuke Hamaguchi uses his ample running time to help us understand his complex, guarded characters so we cannot help but feel happy when they find some measure of happiness"
It's Swamp Thing. It's not Swamp Hamlet or MacBeth Thing.
"Cage delivers a superb performance in a role that seems specifically tailored to his abilities, helping Sarnoski find a brutal reality underneath what initially appears to be a silly concept for a revenge picture."
"[Fellin] turns the world into his circus and, in a liberated, quasi-documentary style, resurrects some of history's great pagliacci with their cornucopia of practical jokes, smashed hats, pulled chairs, popping balloons and squirting flowers."
Silly but irresistible.
"While The Long Night may not be revolutionary, it's definitely got its own dark magic."
"On the run in New York with every hitman in creation on his tail, JW needs the skills of a samurai, the reflexes of a striking snake, the speed and stealth of a wolf, a hide of pig iron and a perfectly tailored suit."
"It is a sitcom with teeth and haunting moral echoes, no small amount of vulgarity and a smart streak of comedy."
"It sounds like the latest release from Blumhouse Productions, but the documentary from filmmakers Shannon Service and Jeffrey Waldron is more frightening than any fabricated specter as the underbelly of Thailand's seafood trade is exposed."
"Imagine a Spike Jonze-Charlie Kauffman-Michel Gondry-style film but with a warm, beating heart instead of cool, detached hipster irony."
"The result is a decent picture, if one that leans pretty heavily on the future resonance of every interaction and conversation."
Springy and funny. A literary adaptation for people who don't like literary adaptations.
"Sorkin owes more to the slam-bang mayhem of Danny Boyle than the visual elegance of David Fincher, but mostly he gets out of the way of his writing - delivering for good and ill (but mostly good) a full-throttle Sorkin ride."
"In spots, the movie can be hysterical. But, for the most part, its appeal is not unlike that of a veteran rock band putting on a greatest hits concert."
"Anchored by Denzel Washington's steely presence, it's a spare, brutal vigilante exercise, with an element of righteous revenge mixed into the balance."
There's something quite wonderful about having a bear that is this free to speak its mind.
"In an age when the Shrek films make oral sex jokes and Cars 2 flip-flops between tedium and terror, the real pleasure of the gentle, graceful Winnie the Pooh is that it is a kid's film that really, truly works for kids."
The performances by Michael Douglas and Matt Damon are wonderful. The fug of jealousy and drug-fuelled paranoia is very well maintained.
A young African Christian travels to Israel in an insightful drama about the moral conflict between religious idealism and the crude materialism of the modern world.
"It's on for the relatively young and old in the sixth M.I. go-round, with Tom Cruise back on deck, Henry Cavill joining the ranks as an agenda-heavy CIA agent and Christopher McQuarrie taking the reins once more."
It's such a superlative movie that it seems better the second time you see it.
"Few films in recent history have moved me quite like Supernova, a sensitive drama starring Stanley Tucci as one half of a gay couple who is slowly but surely succumbing to dementia."
Orphan&#58; First Kill is every bit as satisfyingly twisted as its predecessor&#44; and certainly counts as the most gloriously demented horror surprise since Malignant&#46;
"""Christine"" is based on true events, and I suspect it's all the more powerful if you don't know what happens at the end. I did, but the film still gripped me."
"This latest adaptation of a rarely well-filmed novel makes a strong effort to capture the stiflingly provincial world that Flaubert was able to describe in such precise, painstaking detail on the page."
"Marlon Brando gives a bravura, dusty-voice performance in the title role as the Sicilian who harvests favours from all comers, only to ask them to be paid back."
"Fun, forgettable stuff -- but also a (slightly) better film than the reviews would have you believe."
"Mansfield 66/67 tries to pin down a mythic figure, caught in changing times, changing attitudes towards women, and the endless altercation between exploitation and empowerment."
Makes the Jumanji reboot superfluous.
If Merchant-Ivory made a horror film it would look something like this.
"It's not the tightest picture, but the primary elements are well cared for, providing a reasonable green-and-red rush of festive fun."
"Ben Is Back successfully skirts cliches and subverts addiction drama conventions, but it eventually veers into quasi-thriller territory built around the search for a stolen dog..."
"Just when it seemed as if we had lost Tom Cruise to the ranks of paycheck-cashing automatons no longer interested in applying themselves on screen, along comes American Made to show there's still some life left in the maverick actor."
"Tonally inconsistent, at least it errs on the side of ambition and cleverness; its box-office failure suggests that male genre fans don't want to be asked to identify with the victims instead of the menace."
"Gray’s latest, Armageddon Time, is a flawed work. But it sees the filmmaker at his most vulnerable, as he twists the camera back on himself and asks: of all the paths that brought me here, how many were carved out by my own privilege? "
"""Red Rocket"" remains such a blisteringly raw and febrile character study because of how things fluctuate along the fixed orbit of its star."
"Behind the camaraderie, there's a nuanced story of disenchantment and disillusionment in humanity as the result of greed and war-induced PTSD. [Full review in Spanish]"
A fantastic action thriller with Brandon Lee center stage and showing what he's capable of as a hero and action star.
&#214;stlund gives us plenty to absorb as he runs his filthy rich subjects through the wringer&#46; Some scenes are savagely funny while others are simply savage&#46; More importantly&#44; we&#8217;re always engaged&#46;
Guest seems to know just how far he can stretch reality without losing the crucial texture of verisimilitude. This is a comedy even cat lovers might adore.
On paper it looks like a carbon copy of Highlander but Theron&#46;&#46;&#46; and a series of entertaining action set pieces that are directed with verve and style by director Gina Prince-Bythewood&#46;&#46;&#46; prove you can teach The Old Guard new tricks&#46;
"Stop me if you've heard this one, but sometimes politicians get us into wars that last forever and go nowhere under false pretenses."
An assault of expressionistic techniques...
"There's tons of delicious suspense of the horror-flick variety... and plenty of Spielbergian shock-awe... but what makes it one of the most satisfying examples of found-footage flicks yet is its observational, journalistic ethos."
"The film’s effectiveness depends on what occurs on the way to the answers, and in this respect Shyamalan’s wit and sincerity serve him and the audience well."
"On the surface it looks like any other urban drama, but Tipping's use of whimsical fairy tale and sci-fi elements combines with heartbreaking social commentary for a totally unique experience."
Nelms' screenplay slyly comments on the holiday's superficial elements by cutting away the sentimental veneer.
"A witty exploration of black American culture, past and present."
"If ""Leviathan"" showed us the primal terror of everyday life, this new film is a warm hug, a salute to our shared humanity."
"An excellent comedy with the usual Woody Allen's themes, but with a great mastery of suspense. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Those hungering for rare footage of our cousins playing and foraging, fighting or fleeing are in for a number of treats."
"Aftersun is a bright, funny, immensely likeable and touching film."
...surprisingly poignant...
"A sad, compassionate piece of documentary filmmaking which considers the film industry's exploitation of child actors through a unique prism."
Much of the film is very funny as it explores the eccentricities and daily routines of these Londoners.
"Perhaps the film isn't a grandiose statement of splintered lives, but it's an agreeable drama, best when it stays close to the decomposing heart of a professional liar."
This is a work of profound and melancholic beauty; every bit as essential in the 21st century as it was in the 20th.
"A precursor to the far better Rear Window, but noir has seen better days."
A really well-assembled account of the people and the music they made.
"The incomparable Chris Rock is not known for impersonations, but he mimics Woody Allen, Richard Linklater, Louis C.K. and even Federico Fellini in his directorial pet project Top Five."
"Electric Boogaloo is required viewing for connoisseurs of trash cinema, even if none of the films included are anywhere near as good as it is."
"James Toback's Black and White is meant to be an incendiary movie, but it's really only just OK."
"Nonetheless, these reservations are not intended to diminish the eminent merits of The Best Years of Our Lives, in which the mastery of one of the world's greatest directors is ever on display. "
"[Idris] Elba isn't afraid to keep it real when it comes to visualising D's slow descent to darkness, transitioning from colourful Kingston to run-down, gritty London."
"Jesse and Celine seem like real people, complete with flaws and weaknesses. That they become so fleshed out in such a brief running time is a testament to the script and Hawke and Delpy's acting abilities."
"Warm and witty, but essentially an R-rated TV movie/history lesson."
Reaps its full portion of machismo's horrors and hosannas.
"For anyone who appreciates artistic integrity and is interested in genuinely independent films, the prolific and highly personal work of John Sayles is essential viewing."
Seeing is definitely worth believing in the Hong Kong supernatural thriller The Eye. Quite imaginative and cerebrally challenging for a spookfest narrative...never blinks when it comes to its inherent hair-raising high jinks.
It's not often that you find a film that's completely bonkers and wholesome all in one package. PG: PSYCHO GOREMAN has this in spades.
"The result is a low-key mind-bender that feels half-scripted, half improvised, and -- for the most part -- rather surprisingly compelling."
This is the way The Harry Potter saga was meant to end.
"If your heartstrings are tugged and your eyes water a bit, it’s all earned."
"The film presents the thorny, emotionally charged material with respect and abundant good humor."
"These are movies about driving cars really fast and destroying them. And, yes, the thing with the tank is awesome."
"Hanks does an admirable job of showing Sully's humiliating stress while his reputation was being challenged, with the first-rate support of a cast that includes Laura Linney as his wife, and Jamey Sheridan and Anna Gunn as his surly inquisitors."
One in a Thousand is yet another strong coming-of-age film about queer youth - further proof that these stories will never grow old so long as they're as personal and well-crafted as this.
"Big, showy and over the top with highs, lows, laughs and some truly fist-pumping performances from a diverse cast of familiar actors, most of them in roles requiring some serious belting and hoofing."
"A well-constructed, narratively audacious blockbuster released at a time when such things are in depressingly short supply."
Eli Timoner gave us a manual for how to live&#59; documenting her father&#8217;s life and death&#44; Ondi gives us a manual for how to say goodbye&#46;
"For the most part, ""Pieces of a Woman"" is a model of concentration and clout, fired up by actors of unstinting ardor."
"Beautifully and unobtrusively shot by Moritz Schultheiß, My Skinny Sister is a tender portrait of teenage angst and a salutary warning against the dangers of obsessive calorie counting."
How should I say this&#63; Reminiscent of Hitchcock&#44; the tone is seamless&#44; the performances by Park Hae-il and Tang Wei are flawless&#44; and the storytelling is addictively satisfying and engrossing&#46;
A fun and funny whodunit which manages deliver all the classic troupes of the genre while still feeling fresh and new.
"... Even if The Flying Scotsman doesn't really ever depart from a pretty standard-issue inspirational sports-flick template, as it's subject Graeme Obree proved, you can still do impressive and mighty things on a fixed track."
A not-very-good movie redeemed by a car chase for the ages.
Wiseman's films are as much living organisms as they are subjective portraits.
Despite the early plot give-away the film's robust caricatures and gentle humour keep things bowling along nicely.
We do see New York from some interestingly different angles and Jack goes on a voyage which might inspire others like him.
"It's good - funny, smart and contemporary. By definition it can't be as groundbreaking as the first film, but never does it feel like a cash grab."
A mess when it comes to the characters and writing...but works its way underneath the skin like few movies have in recent memory.
"Langourus, Fellini-esque...But Keitel seems miscast and it goes on one scene too long."
"Not only did I love every silly, gothic, gorgeous minute of Guillermo del Toro's Crimson Peak, I'm actually suspicious of those who didn't."
"An informative, entertaining, and emotional picture of a choreographer, his friends and colleagues, and his most important work..."
"...a wonderful thing, intelligent in the ways of human foible, and generous with sinners."
"Awesome! Up-ends the genre. No dialogue, no exposition, no explanation and no kissing. Just pure energy (and heroic stunt work)!"
"Though all the actors try to expand their underwritten roles, Mirren is most successful."
"Throughout this film, I am inside of what I'm told, I fear what unravels next, and the suspense is certainly transmitted in the worry I had while watching. [Full Review in Spanish]"
It is beautifully acted by leads Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva and inspires sympathy.
Documentarian Otto Bell's titular huntress - a 13-year-old Kazakh named Aisholpan who hails from a family boasting generations of champion (male) eagle hunters - is impossible not to like and/or root for.
"Last Night in Soho is a stirring, yet deeply flawed production. Your overall takeaway will depend on how willing you are to forgive its third act."
"Touching, funny story of childhood in Sweden."
"Wenders trains his camera on photographer Sebastiao Salgado and the result, though not without flaws, is an invigorating and interesting observation of the man, his work and the entire medium of photography."
The Iron Lady is a clever and oddly touching entertainment.
"I've never seen the stage musical Rent, but the movie had me at hello."
"A sleek, surprising and surefire thriller that will grab you by the throat."
"This heightened atmosphere sets the perfect tone for the story, which is rife with scheming, torqued emotion, and of course, incredible fight scenes."
There's so much to love here! I appreciated seeing Estella's (Cruella's) creativity shine and her bravery in facing hardship.
The twists and turns in this mystery-thriller would be enough for us to recommend it. Splendid performances by Kidman and Stan seal the deal.
"There isn't much originality in this rude female-led comedy, but its observations on single life are a nicely updated twist on the Sex and the City formula."
A devastating exploration of repressed desire and unspoken longing.
"A solid if far-fetched thriller that still entertains, even as it goes off the rails. Terrible title, mind."
"A bittersweet teen film that has much to offer even those of us who have, in theory, grown up."
"""Our Idiot Brother"" is made gently comic thanks to Rudd's fool-on-the-hill vibe and a quirky and effervescent supporting cast."
"While it's no Raging Bull, it is fun, if you're willing to roll with the punches."
"... superior [to the original] in that it makes clear the conflicting justification and degradation of the retaliation, establishing a grayer level of morality."
My favorite moment involves a Jar-Jar Binks tattoo -- and whether or not that idea strikes you as funny should be a pretty good indicator of whether or not you'll like Fanboys.
"9 Prisoners feels like a near-modern-masterpiece, with both Alexandre Moratto and Christian Malheiros cementing themselves as two of the strongest voices working in film today."
"The performances by Courtenay and Rampling are excellent. They look and act the part of an old married couple, used to each other's habits and quirks. This is an effective drama about a gathering storm in an old relationship."
"Provides Humor & Heart, But It's No Marvel"
"Like the best movies often do, ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" leaves audiences with a complex set of emotions, and with a hard-to-define hint of the profound."
"""Captain America: Civil War"" is a much better version of ""Batman v Superman."" Not only does the film juggle a dozen major superheroes pretty seamlessly, but it manages to tell a cohesive story without making the film feel too stuffed."
"Leave No Trace speaks, not just to the trauma and the damage of soldiers who have seen too much in war, but wider questions of endurance and the soul that can touch all of us."
Like the franchise it's clearly inspired by-the Step Up series-ABCD 2 tricks out simple messages with spectacular dance sequences.
"It may not be for the faint of heart, but Uncut Gems is a hell of a way to kick-start the new year, like stepping onto a moving streetcar."
"The Whale builds slowly but surely towards that mad coup de grâce, which will either leave you cold or sweep you heavenward: for me, it was a quintessential Aronofsky flourish; as loopily sublime..."
Nighthawks is a compelling movie with plenty of adrenaline-pumping chase sequences.
"An up close and personal biographical study of the activist and longstanding public servant, as well as a compelling examination of the history of the Civil Rights movement, through Lewis' vital role in it."
A fabulously well-crafted motion-picture. (...) as close to being in the bunker oneself as one can get.
"Probably one for those already enamoured with its creator, though there are numerous fascinating threads to untangle from this baroque tapestry if one has the patience."
"An acidic, anarchic layer cake of mental illness with comedy teddy bear Seth Rogen as its seal of approval. It'll be fascinating to see how this demented, treehouse feature is received by audiences accustomed to far bouncier takes on smutty giggles."
"None are as watchable as the pretty, prancing, plotting, primal Weaving, who also helps deliver some of the dark humor she teams with to save this predictable, but engaging enough summer horror silliness."
"To understand why Rhodes and Obama are so pleased with their foreign policy, you have to understand the way they think. The documentary is revealing about that."
"A wonderful family achievement, not overwrought or too sentimental, but a powerful example of the contemporary immigrant and American experience."
"The situation delivers less wackiness than it promises, and there aren't a lot of big laughs. Charm fills the void, though."
"Yeah, 'Captain America: Civil War' is true to its frenetic form as revved up entertainment preparing moviegoers for the upcoming summertime sizzle at the box office. After all, the on-screen Marvel Comics gravy train keeps moving merrily along"
A first-class thriller and thought-provoking morality play.
"Apart from a contrived ending, Jindabyne comes as close as can be to a perfect drama."
"The Hunt works as simplistic, cathartic melodrama. It's about ambiguity, but there's nothing ambiguous about the film itself."
"For a script that relies more on character-driven than situational comedy, it's the perfs that count, and these are thankfully strong."
...Black Panther is one of the best Marvel films ever.
"""Hereditary"" is haunting in stretches, but Aster doesn't know when to quit, threatening to ruin a good thing with needless overkill."
"The film was clearly a passion project for Winter and Reeves, and there's something joyous about watching them reprise the roles that helped jumpstart their careers -- especially when it feels more like a labor of love than a disingenuous cash grab."
"By the time the credits roll, Landis has given us the goods, but more importantly, he's given us a good story."
"It's heavy subject matter, but the film is remarkably light on its feet. Budreau matches Baker's creative ingenuity, turning the cliched events of his subject's life into a bracingly original story"
It's an art movie for the masses.
"Frank Capra's most ambitious and disturbing film, Meet John Doe is possibly more relevant today than when it first appeared in 1941."
"Thankfully for all of us, Schumer continues to lean in."
"Rouan's writing, as far as can be judged from subtitles, is pointed and vital. Her performance is superb."
I don't know why Hong's films are much more attractive to me than Noah Baumbachs. Haewon and many of Hong's films ring true to me in portraying human relationships.
"If you have a soft spot for feisty, back-talking bambini with cute squints, backwards caps and names like Crutchy, Dutchy and Bumlets, your heart will melt."
An engaging (if overlong) romantic comedy...
What could easily have fallen into Lifetime Movie territory gets a boost from a talented&#44; accomplished cast&#46;

One of the greatest films I've ever seen.
"Reviewing a Coen Brothers film is usually an exercise in inventively arranging superlatives, and  True Grit definitely doesn't break from the mould."
The third film manages to remember what the second film forgot about the first film: be fun.
"While there's stunning scenery in the movie, it's mostly a backdrop to a narrative that's more about spirit than spectacle. In this case, the subject of the film is something that can't be captured on any size screen."
Hereditary is so scary relatives five generations back will be able to sense your fear.
"There are a few incredibly great laughs, and believe it or not, it's the most ""fun"" of the slasher horror films there's been in the 10 movies."
"The chases and fight scenes are fun, if repetitive, and each member of the diverse and affable cast gets a little bit of business to do... But F9's attempts at classical drama, all its reckoning with dynastic sin, do weigh the thing down quite a bit."
"Such a personal take is necessarily also partial. There's no Pete Doherty here, nothing from her last boyfriend, no one from the music industry... There are touching glimpses into the afterlife of a shortlived talent"
Brett Morgen makes some odd choices&#46; But on the whole&#44; this is an immersion into the quintessence of Bowie&#46;  An intoxicating portrait of the artist as a constantly morphing young man&#44; middle-aged man and man facing death before his time&#46;
Brutal class realities in contemporary Iran
A thorny and intricate film that is also breathtakingly simple and honest.
"It is an evocative time capsule, but Many Saints does not depict the formative experiences of its ostensible subject, Tony Soprano."
It's the Backyard Acting Olympics.
"So, here's the scoop: Though nowhere near as masterful as last year's Match Point or the Allen classic comedies of the '70s and '80s, Scoop is modest, late-summer fun."
"A masterwork of symbolic cinema; it depicts, with vast imagination, the ordeals faced by women in modern Iranian society."
"A simple, somewhat creaky tribute to defiant courageousness."
"""Pain and Glory"" can be achingly sad, but its pleasures, rainbow hues and humor keep it (and you) aloft."
In a word: Flawless. First Man is a stunning film where everything works in symphony.
"This film does so many things right, it's hard to say what to single out for praise."
"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Theme introduces us to a wondrous world outside of our cinematic Potter knowledge, and works as a prime set-up even if substance is a bit slight."
"an ingeniously plotted and witty reflex on the horror genre itself, as well as its voyeuristic audience and its cathartic function."
"Few movies grab the lonely, lost and timeless suck of freshman year at college as well as ""Sh*thouse."""
The acting and writing are so solid that the grifters and con artists who populate this film are simultaneously appalling and appealing&#46;&#46;&#46;
With its cast of oddballs and dilapidated urbanity&#44; &quot;Funny Pages&quot; speaks not just about a past era of cartooning but an earlier of trend of films inspired by it&#46;
"There are concert films, and there's Beyonce!"
If you can handle more repetition in the name of fun and entertainment there's actually a lot to be gained from the film's gentle dissection of human foibles and the meaningless nature of time.
"If Perry's cinematic vision remains less than 20/20, his sagacity gets stronger by the movie."

"The talent of the director consists in exploring, with discretion and without a hint of moralism, the complexity of this psychological trance. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"There are definitely some pacing problems-and a muddled message about centrism that could've been elaborated on or dropped-but if the ultimate intention of a romcom is to make you both laugh and swoon, then Long Shot is right on target."
"Duplicates many of the strengths of the original, without surpassing or even matching its originality and inspiration"
A fascinating introduction to one of France's major filmmakers.
"While the story is simply ludicrous, the sensational camera work and action more than make up for it."
"I'm sorry that it didn't wrap up in a more inventive way, but I really did enjoy it until it got there."
It's rare a movie as singularly uplifting as Wild Rose comes along.

There&#8217;s a feverish anticipation of who&apos;s going to crack first under the delicate circumstances&#44; but all ended up lukewarm&#44; with limited novelty&#46;
A flawed but funny and heartfelt film that suggests: maybe you can go home again-even if that means coming back to Jersey.
"This Ant-Man is clever enough to be fun, and wise enough not overstay its welcome. Who better understands the benefits, after all, of keeping it small?"
An electric display of activism and vitality in the face of death. [Full review in Spanish]

... the classic chick flick story long before any flick found the word chick.

"Herzog's film may not be the final word on Gorbachev, but it is affectionate and candid and leaves audiences in a melancholy mood about the sometimes short-lived nature of reform."
"Peter Dinklage details Fin's solitude in single glances, but his countenance also warms to eventual friendship. It's an attenuated, reserved, realistic performance - bolstered when we learn Fin is silent because shouting only summons repressed rage."
The two-hour runtime flies by as the Coens shame bloated blockbusters with sheer craft.
"[The Glorias] contains some extraordinary subjects, and Taymor dramatizes them with stellar historical elements and colorful character dynamics."
"Presented as a mixture of journalistic woe and political conspiracy, a brightly scrubbed cast and a tightly wound pace manage to make the best use of its running time."
...a good film with some great moments and two excellent lead performances...
"It won't blow you away, and in some respects it feels like a missed opportunity, but there is something genuine about the Duplass' film that is pleasing to see."
The baroque blast of stylized design&#44; gothic hysteria and black humor teases&#44; terrifies&#44; and raises the drama to operatic levels&#46;
"Although it's quite long at 2 1/2 hours, Prisoners holds interest and tension thanks to the strength of the screenplay and craftsmanship of the cast and crew. Be warned: you will not want to take a bathroom break during the film, so go before"
"Gunpowder Milkshake still has its moments of fun, but the whole bloody affair is just missing a heart and a bit of soul."
"This is no doubt the first of many movies that will struggle to tell the stories of a war that's far from over, and even if the tale is imperfectly told, it commands our attention."
"""We Live in Public"" is a cautionary look at how surveillance affects individuals. Far from the Wim Wenders's ""End of Violence"" premise, it could signify the end of the world as we know it."
"With his physical stature and moral gravitas, the gifted Liam Neeson elevates Carnahan's survival thriller way above its familiar elements of man vs. nasty nature and cruel wolves."
"Exhausting and exhilarating, it's an inspirational saga."
"Mitchell reshapes tried-and-true scare conventions - teens in peril, a relentless malevolent force, jarring soundtrack - into an unexpectedly unique creepfest. And his riffs on sex and adulthood are refreshing in their allegorical complexity."
"With remarkable assurance, Bhaji On the Beach sketches a large number of characters who are both universally recognizable and plausible as the product of a particular subculture."
an intriguing existential space oddity
"... Palmer -- and J.J. Villarreal, as her unflappable fellow contestant and first-blush romantic interest -- makes it all go down very easily."
"But while the film sometimes feels busy and scattered, Janney and Robbie are vivid anchors, diving into the kind of complicated, boundary-pushing characters that, let's face it, are usually the domain of men onscreen."
...the film would've been vastly improved had it been trimmed down to 90 minutes.
"It's a beautiful, melancholy film, and makes you begin to wonder if Karl Marx didn't have a point."
"This enigmatic, poetic film, co-directed by brothers Ramon and Silvan Zürcher, instils intimations of the cosmic into a deliberately ordinary narrative frame."
"2017's best feature film...a masterpiece, an emotionally affecting epic. Campillo saves his most provocative moment for last, an astounding depiction of love, death and the fight for life."
"A dense and thorough reimagining of the material -- it's got the same mordant cynicism running through its veins, only updated for an even darker, more jittery era."

Ly is a deft orchestrator of story - and chaos.
A messed-up way to spend Mother's Day

"As a work of fiction, Stillwater feels near-masterpiece level with Tom McCarthy, Matt Damon and Abigail Breslin giving possibly the best performances of their careers. The movie, however, is undeniably tied to a real-life tragedy and feels manipulative"
Wolfe retains a lot of Wilson's play's theatricality in this cinematic rendition and it's all to its immense strength. Davis and especially Boseman are on a whole other level.
The working title was Ship of Fools but should have been Abbott and Costello Take Some Speed.
"So much of this oddly named but perfectly played dramedy feels real, from the revisits to VHS tapes in parents' basements to the way a family member's glance can trigger fight-or-flight responses."
"Strikingly well-produced, this documentary takes a deep dive into systemic racism in Australian society through the salient perspectives of football legend Adam Goodes and journalist Stan Grant."
"Given his own failed attempts at becoming an auteur, it is all too perfect that James Franco finally finds his muse, successfully humanizing one of cinema's few genuine eccentrics."

An endearing Tibetan drama about loving others and giving up one's attachments.
"Inspiring, if Harrowing, For Sama Is for All of Us."
"For fans who ask for nothing more than something upbeat and friendly, it should satisfy, even if it isn't long remembered."
A fun romp supported by creative and clever world-building. Pratt's vocal performance and the character of Barley are a necessary element in keeping things buoyant enough to bounce through this story.
"Production design and acting aside, this film is less than one wants it to be."
"Though a clear notch beneath its classic predecessor Finding Nemo, lively pacing and a genuinely inspired finale is sure to leave viewers of all ages perfectly happy with what they have seen."
"It's an enchantingly well-done tribute that revives, and even refreshes, our affection for the Stooges, yet at its core it lacks the completely and totally unhinged shock of the new."
"Despite a tricky, intellectualising premise complete with god-like figure who calls the shots, this strange, gloomy and beautiful sci-fi drama is engaging and impressive"

"Clever animated superhero story is fun, not too scary."

The movie is clearly intriguing in ways it may not have intended.
"It's rare that a movie that is concerned with issues currently in the headlines is more than that, but Aki Kaurismaki's touching and funny The Other Side of Hope, which focuses on the migrant crisis in Europe, pulls it off."
The Help has so much heart it's easy to feel both sorrow and enjoyment while watching such an emotional film.
Julie & Julia is a delectable cinematic concoction about two food-loving women.

The film's heart is Magdiel and the modest dreams that get him through the day but may also be the death of him.
The story twists beautifully and shockingly. The ending is brilliant. Skillfully directed by Jordan Scott.
"In short, this isn't a bad film, and it's probably worth seeing for Lady Gaga alone, but also it's not a great one."
"The Eyes of My Mother is effective and unsettling, and as a first movie from Pesce, promises much more in the future."
"How do we keep our wits about is when all that is left behind for us is chaos, confusion and fear? ( ... ) it is generational trauma that is the Big Bad for a new generation."

The new film hints mischievously at the kind of dysfunction that would truly bring the Brady bunch up to date.
Wild Rose is as wily as its titular character. This tale of a Glasgow born country (not country-western) singer and ex-convict can't help but have a bit of an unexpected edge.

This gripping (or nauseating) film has power beyond its ideas.
A very frank and gritty story about two brothers.
"""The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby: Them"" is worth seeing, if only for the way the camera lingers on Jessica Chastain as if she's a silken magnet."
"Storks is at times cacophonous and overly busy, and the animation tends toward the goofy rather than the spectacular. However, Stoller manages to pull off a third act and emotional resolution that's genuinely moving."
The filmmakers celebrate his prodigious achievements but the sadness is that he never managed to escape the hothouse world of the fashion industry.

Three generations of women struggle to survive in an inhospitable wilderness in Brazil far from civilization.
"A dizzyingly attractive film that breaks down Noam Chomsky's ideas, filters them through Michel Gondry's unique way of seeing, and in the process breaks down the differences between art, science and philosophy"

A genial and glossy middle-brow rom/com blended together with corny Capra-like political drama.
Dench makes mincemeat of the often pedantic material.

"Akin makes this a most intriguing, if roundabout, journey from despair to 'do something.'"
"Effective as it all is - even with an over-reliance on jump scares - ""The Purge: Election Year"" is, like the rest of the films in a series, an ugly one, reliant on scenes of sadism and depravity."
"At the film's core is the question, what if some love is based not on love but in a dichotomy of horrific power and desire?"
Repulsive but mesmerizing.
We see the seeds of something special here; Palmer cements herself here as one to watch in the years to come.
"It manages to infuse its simple narrative with a spicily subversive attitude toward traditional gender roles, while spooning its audience generous helpings of sweetly seductive costume romance."

Elephant invites scrutiny but defies explanation.
Sidney Lumet returns to the sort of form he showed in his heyday. It helps that we're on Lumet's favourite territory -- the heist gone wrong.

The first part of The Phantom could almost be a summation to the jury by the prosecution.
Paul Green is like the crazy uncle that your kids love to be around even if he makes them cry.
"For the most part this is an entertaining, and old-fashioned feeling film."
Breaking the rules has never seemed so fun . . . or so necessary.

"Along with The Postman segment from Satyajit Ray's Two Daughters, it is, I think, the greatest short film ever made."
"Lohman adapts to the changes required of her, but the actress and director Peter Kosminsky never get the audience to break through the wall her character erects"
"Precious captures how a lost girl rouses herself from the dead, and Daniels shows unflinching courage as a filmmaker by going this deep into the pathologies that may still linger in the closets of some impoverished inner-city lives."
"Sayles' prolix narrative, weighed down with subplots and characters and canvassing many social ills, dilutes the impact of a work that should nevertheless still make an impact on thoughtful viewers."
His latest offering is as vibrant as any he has produced.
Reno himself can take credit for most of the movie's success. He's one of the few 'cool' actors who never seems aware of his own coolness.
"There may be much that is familiar, but with this version Wright nevertheless manages to be both reverent and innovative, with more than a dash of ... panache."
"A well-crafted tearjerker with a grown-up performance from Zac Efron. If you don't mind risking dehydration, it's the movie for you."
The deliriously demented 1960s Japanese show 'Johnny Sokko and His Flying Robot' proves to be a stronger influence on 'Pacific Rim' than any Godzilla movie.
... A suspense masterpiece ...
"""Happy being weird, at least giving the film some character when the storyline is too poorly executed to pick up the slack."""
"Weitz's rousing satire is no dream: It's the mad, mad real world of America in the year 2006."
"On the surface a literate werewolf thriller, the subtext of Mike Nichols' Wolf is a sharp critique about what it takes to succeed in the cutthroat corporate world."
"Efficient and highly effective in its style, relying on sound, creepy production design, and the men's own fear and misjudgment to create the sense of pervasive doom."
"Yesterday fulfills its modest ambitions with warmth and gentle humor. It wouldn't, however, make any impact if it were magically erased from existence."
"This beautiful 2K restoration...features the original intertitles while simulating the color tinting and toning of the original not seen since the 1920's...Unveiled at the 2016 Berlin Film Festival, Kino Lorber's release is a real treat for cinephiles."

An intriguing if rather run-of-the-mill feature debut for writer-director Yannick Saillet.
"A well made, atmospheric British thriller with terrific performances from a superb cast, though it's a little undermined by some casting issues and the script falters towards the end."
I will probably get a few digs from my friends for insisting that Ford v. Ferrari is not only entertaining but also smart.
"For those seeking a wickedly dark little confection, Thoroughbreds should prove a diverting watch; but those looking for anything deeper will find a lot left to be desired."
"Pushes the idea of the capricious monarch through the far reaches of comedy and almost into tragedy. Colman embodies sublimely the punch-drunk confusion of a woman unsure whether she's child or adult, plaything or puppet-master."
"The sort of romance that doesn't come around too often&#151;intelligent without being saccharine, heartfelt without being condescending."
If you've seen 'You Can Count on Me' you have a pretty good idea where 'The Skeleton Twins' is headed in its somewhat didactic approach to celebrating the unbreakable bonds siblings share. Yet you admire it just the same.
"This rip-roaring slice of sci-fi excess remains Arnold Schwarzenegger's most satisfying film since his breakthrough hit, The Terminator."

Bong Joon-ho does an exemplary job balancing a mystery with both humorous and dramatic elements.
Has a few scares up its sleeve ...
"If you're able to give yourself over to it, there's a quiet brutality to this tale of dogmatic obsession, shot and performed with simmering intensity as it is."
"Anxiety inducing imagery aside, I already want to watch this flick again."
"Set in the ruthlessly competitive ballet world, Black Swan is a trashy melodrama with a glossy artsy treatment, but it's gripping due to its speed and Natalie Portman's Oscar-caliber performance."
"As remakes go, Disney's latest might just be their best one yet, soaring to such stratospheric heights I almost can't help but be amazed."
"It's quaint, a little rustic but magical in its own way."
Ant-Man is great; an optimistic jaunt with plenty of cleverness and oodles of joy. Yet another feather in Marvel Studio's increasingly peacocked cap.
As we all know&#44; leaky containers can result in zombies&#44; as in The Return of the Living Dead&#44; homicidal maniacs&#44; as in The Crazies&#44; or a mind leech&#44; as in Mind Leech&#46;

Its blend of speed and music makes 'Baby Driver' one of the year's best films.

"It has a light, shaggy charm, and De Niro is at his most winningly comical."

VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN is an enjoyable - if more than a bit silly - take on the classic story.
"[A] rich, fun and fascinating film experience."
"Senna feels a touch too short to be fully realized -- but then again, so was Ayrton Senna's life."
"It ... is worth watching for its crackerjack opening and the strength of its young cast, but mainly because of its inherent promise of (possibly) better things to come."
"I loved this, it's hilarious, heart warming and a little stroke of genius.."
"Shanghai Noon feels both like a flashback to an earlier time of more innocent pictures, and also slightly predictive of the vanguard of colourful comic-book cinema to come."
"Tully is worth a look for its true-to-life characters, its sensitive acting, its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer Hilary Birmingham."

"Villeneuve's Dune takes a bit of time to set up the necessary palace intrigue and family dynamics before finding its shape as a relentless, propulsive chase movie."

"Yes, it's a crowd pleaser and you can count me in as very much part of the crowd."

"Unpredictable, richly crafted, and beautifully written, The Drop is like the best liquor from the top shelf: it goes down hard and harsh, but it hangs on and gets its hooks right into you."
Gray keeps his picture interesting with a handful of inspired action scenes
The Oscar-nominated Rear Window isn&apos;t just one of Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s best films but one of the greatest thrillers ever made&#46;
"Chris Peckover's Christmas horror comedy is a deft melding of ""Scream"" and ""Home Alone"" that takes a surprisingly nasty turn in its last act...he really excels in his direction of his young cast"
"Mathieu Kassovitz is making a determined challenge for the stylish French sci-fi thriller crown of Luc Besson with this highly effective, highly charged action movie, even though he has had to rather mangle the novel on which it is based"
"[I]ts daffy, otherworldly story, rehearsing but not rehashing Stillman's frankly reactionary instincts, resounds less for its charming gaggle of collegiate women than for its dramatization of self-deception and the despair of depression."

This contradiction - an activist for social justice with a blue-blooded partner - is sadly never explored.

It's an achingly poignant meditation on passion and loneliness in oxygen-choked Kuala Lumpur.
"Great documentaries, of which this is one, need great subjects, and Mr. Honnold fills the bill; he's thoughtful, funny, articulate, self-reflective and fatalistic to a scary degree."
"Adheres to the dumb/smart approach of other classics such as Airplane! and The Naked Gun. Opens strong, gets a lot of funny jokes in and then loses steam heading into the finale, but a worthy early horror parody nonetheless"
"Will appeal mostly to those who love theater and relish the opportunity to see a production being built, scene by scene."
"The craftsmanship of ""A War"" is unimpeachable. Tight shots and jittery camera work give the film an immediate, intimate feel."

"More than a narrative, the film is a study in visual ways to convey the ""swimmy,"" unreal sensations of love at first sight."
"Detroit is a gut-punch of a movie, one that pulls you in to the ugliness lying beneath the American id."
A slick and stylish horror comedy which delivers on both fronts.
"The Iperess File is a thriller set in a recognisable London where espionage is a seedy business conducted, not by impregnable Bonds, but by men as scared and venal as anyone else."
"Writer-director Sofia Coppola has produced a small-scale movie that exalts old-fashioned movie-making qualities, yielding a refreshingly understated alternative to a sea of summer blockbusters."

This is an inspirational film about perseverance.
"Solidly telling in its methodical truth, Green's film is unassumingly dazzling in its low-key observations. The Assistant is impressively potent without the overstated exclamation of acrimony."
Director Sollett adds a humanistic layer of insight and wisdom to the story that transcends teen-pic formulas.
One of the best films of the year-it salutes openness and respect for life as antidotes to the use of violence to deal with the uncertainty and insecurity of our times.
The final 20 minutes of the film prove once again that what you can't see is infinitely more frightening than what you can..leaves you goosey and tense.
Funny when it needs to be. I don't know what more you can ask from the third installment of a series that has gone further than anyone reasonably could have expected.
"Politics aside, Herzog uses a realistic tone to depict a high-energy capture and escape."
"Like most of Grisham's stories, the set-up is better than the wrap-up, but this is a cast that knows how to satisfy, even when the material doesn't."
...a perfectly watchable (yet undeniably overlong) entry in an almost remarkably consistent series...
"As the characters get more intimate, so too does the film, with McCormack and, especially, Thompson cutting through the film’s more mechanical execution to deliver rounded portraits of people yearning for human connection in a judgmental world."
"The film is effective even when didactic, and Munn is terrific."
"For Daniel Craig the world of Bond could not be more far away: if his East European accent wobbles at times to Liev Schreiber's more authentic vocal, he looks the part of a man who can both kill and care."
"Adam Brody keeps the unnamed protagonist distant, strangely blank, as if part of his problem is his lack of any real personality of his own, prompting him to parasitise the charismatic women he meets and try to substitute scandalous behaviour for depth."
May be the finest thriller/romance hybrid of the new century.
"Its vision is unique and harrowing, its song hits to the heart."
"...two terrific bad guys. Banderas and Zeta-Jones are sexy and funny. Even with too many ridiculous fights, this is a lot of fun."
"It's a story designed to play the heartstrings like a fiddle, extracting sighs and sobs from willing viewers with surgical precision."
"The only slipup is a forgivable one. Jackson continues to be reluctant to leave a world he has so magnificently created. At a little over three hours, King Kong is a bit of a bum-number."
"There are plenty of great things about American Honey, but when stretched out to an incomprehensibly epic length, it is hard to see it as anything other than wasted potential."
"The film has grace, rhythm and music for a while with the story of the young man who only yearns to escape the crime world to rebuild his life. [Full review in Spanish]"
"It's no Jaws, but The Shallows is still a viciously, violently fun wave to ride."
"Delivers a hell of a lot of thrills as an R-rated romp that's refreshingly standalone, not trying to set up any sequels."
"Boyle -- and maybe Sorkin, though the domineering Sorkinese makes it hard to surmise -- is doing something smarter, even outright subversive."
"There are times in Christopher Nolan's somnolent crime caper where you'll find yourself recognizing moments from your own subconscious on the screen, to a thrilling, frightening and ultimately inspiring effect."
Taylor-Joy and Cooke are top-notch.
"The movie evaporates in the mind, but Stewart and Eisenberg have real movie-star chemistry."
A terrific picture crouched in the centre of a blasted Icelandic winter.
That moment where we see Captain Marvel in her full glory punching holes through the sky letting the audience know every girl can fly&#63; That moment Captain Marvel absolutely delivers&#46;
"The contrast in the acting styles of Pacino, De Niro and Pesci are predictable, yet gripping in this mob drama. Director Martin Scorsese is in his element directing this finely tuned 3 and a half hour lavish production."
"With some cool superhero action, Megamind is mildly amusing for the most part, but it feels like it could have been much better."
"Here, with everything that he's ever cared about on the line, Hunt proves why he's summer's most valuable action hero."
"""Scream 4"" lacks the qualities that would make it a masterpiece, but it testifies to the cyclical nature of commercial storytelling in sharp, nearly timeless fashion."

Peter Dinklage is excellent as the mob's chief lawyer.
"Surprisingly candid, comprehensive and, most of all, emotional expos of the wrestling business."
"Follows [Pekar's] journey with originality, humor and humanity"

Iron Man is an action sci-fi blockbuster extravaganza that provides cartoon thrills for thinking people. It's the best movie of its kind since the second Spider-Man movie four years ago.
"The director's affectionate warts-and-all portrait of his milieu and subculture is blistering, cogently capturing how England's early-'80s skinhead movement was driven less by blind racial intolerance than by intense socio-economic tensions."
"The movie is self-pity disguised as self-sacrifice (he'll do anything for his fans) but it's also, by any measure, often funny."
This is terrific film-making - enough to bring a rush of blood to the head.
"Whether you know it or not, kids, you've now got your own generation's Close Encounters of The Third Kind."
Athlete A raises a lot of questions about the USAG's practices.
"The Unborn is a culty midnight movie that, like far more such films than we tend to credit, has a brain whose synapses are constantly firing away just beneath all the gore."
"Cove is a stirring call to arms, providing the damning dolphin massacre argument forcefully and creatively. I can't say the film will change the world, but it certainly will make those trips to Sea World more awkward."
"Maguire's otherworldly coolness suits the observer drawn into a story he might prefer only to watch. DiCaprio is persuasive as the little boy lost impersonating a tough guy, and Mulligan finds ways to express Daisy's magnetism and weakness."
"""The Day after Tomorrow is junk, but it's not a rip-off. Emmerich sincerely wants to entertain you, which is more than you can say for most of his Hollywood peers."""
"Kumail Nanjani and Issa Rae's chemistry and ease of dialogue make The Lovebirds feel like a throwback to corny, yet entertains Golden-Age rom coms. Unicorn suits, milkshake monologues and ride share jokes are worth the ride."
"An accomplished, insightful, touching film."
&quot;The Lighthouse&quot; has echoes of Melville and Lovecraft as well as Coleridge and Greek mythology&#44; all stirred together in a psychedelic stew&#44; or a cup of turpentine and honey&#46; The honey is the film&apos;s sumptuous aesthetic&#46;
"It willingly follows its characters into the muck of brotherly love, misery, impulse and idiocy."
"A lot of The Descendants is affecting, but its mushier tone is often less emotionally resonant than the bitter sarcasm of Payne's earlier work."
"It has dryly obscene, laugh-out-loud lines, and its portrait of Hollywood as a giant anxiety attack is fused by De Niro, who musters a desperate, nagging warmth beneath his grumbly facade."
"A Monster Calls may seem like a simple fantasy film, but it goes beyond that to tackle a very real tragedy - losing someone. Word of advice: bring a lot of tissues to this one."
You won't be able to dismiss this movie as easily as Etienne ignores Lolita.
a masterpiece of action adventure science fiction fueled by a terrific international cast...Joon-ho has more on his mind than startling imagery and violence and his climax is both breathtaking and an emotional gut punch.
I Served the King of England ends up a curious combination of raunchy merriment and malignant undercurrents.
... a dramedy thatll have you laughing through tears.
A tight-fisted and paranoid mini-classic.
"Bielinsky's script is slick and fiendishly clever, with seemingly a twist a minute."
"Forget motion-capture, this is motion-rapture. Meanwhile, Oscar-winning composer Michael Giacchino (Up) finds some extraordinary piano notes to emphasise contemplative silence as much as imminent threat."
This is an almost apocalyptic tale of thwarted emotion - love cut short - set in a pitiless land of delusions.
"It's too much of a stretch to say Venom is ""good,"" but it's certainly not terrible, and maybe worth seeing for Hardy alone."
"One of the broadest, silliest (yet somehow still endearing) stoner comedies in a while, indulging the adult members of the cast with particular gusto."
"It's just, like ... well, a lot like real life for 20-somethings."
"Through her constant swings between the public and the private, Whitney tears the icon and reveals a soul. [Full Review in Spanish]"

Wright remarkably shows you how instead of iron fists as tools&#44; we see Edgerton&#8217;s Mark uses something entirely different &#8212; empathy&#46;
"Nichols ... tells the Lovings' story in a way that feels immediate and modern, and not just like a history lesson."

"This is an, at times, terrifying film that, refreshingly, does not rely on cheap jump scares."
Nymphomaniac isn't as much about female power as the dialogue occasionally suggests; it's more about being misunderstood because of the things you choose (or are compelled) to pursue.
"This good natured film feels like an episode of Nashville mixed with an episode of Friday Night Lights, two television shows I happen to enjoy, in spite of their soapiness."
Luck doesn&#8217;t break a lot of new ground&#46; But the movie has some creative elements and likable characters&#46; The animation is solid&#44; though not eye popping&#46; The voice cast is good&#46; &#46;&#46;&#46; It&#8217;s a rare movie these days that has both a G-rating and a plot&#46;
"Olivier Martinez makes the kind of visceral impression Brad Pitt made in Thelma and Louise, but it's Gere's layered performance that makes Unfaithful a sophisticated, interesting adult drama."
"Marketed as a guitar summit between The Edge, Jimmy Page, and Jack White, Davis Guggenheim's affectionate, intermittently insightful behind-the-music doc is more electric triptych than meeting of the minds."
"Its nastiness sings, instead of stings."
"The protagonists are likable, have charismatic chemistry, and are portrayed brilliantly. You will love to hate the well crafted antagonist who creates obstacles for our leads."
"For a film that's just shy of being three hours long, it never felt bloated; every sequence seemed to have its place, and at the right pace..."
"Harari chooses to create a psychological portrait of his central character, using images rather than explanations of ideology to tap into Onoda’s mind-set."

"This powerful, heartfelt and important drama from one of the great names in world cinema deserves to be seen."
You know how much of a guy flick this is? There's no women in it.
A profoundly sexist and eminently hummable 1954 CinemaScope musical with some terrific athletic Michael Kidd choreography and some better-than-average direction by Stanley Donen.
A Hidden Life is a commanding piece of cinema that lingers long after you've left the theatre.
Something that the whole family can love.
A great big hug of a film.
"Gook may not come close to the electric greatness of Lee's 1989 film but, as a gesture in its direction, it's alive with biting promise."

Patrice Ch&#233;reau's startling drama recounts the dissolution of a marriage of a couple (Pascal Greggory and Isabelle Huppert) from the haute bourgeoisie.

Features a strong performance from the criminally underrated Robert Pattinson.
"Reilly is fantastic, the music is right on, and the commentary is obnoxiously accurate, so while Walk Hard may not go to 11, it's definitely worth a seven or an eight."
"If this truly is the end of this tale on the big-screen, it's going out in grand fashion."
A solid laugh machine...
There is a magnificent introspection about the dichotomy between dream and memory. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Griffith has honestly never been funnier, and Play the Game is a delightful, thoroughly entertaining romantic comedy that reminds us all just why we fell in love with him in the first place."
"The deck is stacked, and the disingenuousness is profound, but director John Lee Hancock is good at saving his big schmaltz cards to play at the end."
"The picture is also further evidence that no matter how beautifully rendered it is or how complex the emotional context, and Big Fish & Begonia is both beautiful and complex, any shot of a sea creature leaping over a human will invoke Free Willy."
"While Platoon is easily one of the year's finest films, I'm not sure if it's the long-awaited definitive Vietnam movie, as some early reviews have suggested. But it is the gamest attempt so far to explain how America suffered a humiliating defeat."
"Gilligan has proven, again and again, that he is a skilled storyteller in this universe, and if a post-finale finale had to exist, El Camino is a lovely coda that puts Jesse's tortured soul to rest, in a way."
"A monumental mockumentary from Brit cinema's premier director/actor double act. True, daft, emotional, hilarious."
Of interest today strictly for Lon Chaney's bell-ringing performance.

Sophisticated sci-fi - stunningly well-crafted and acted.
"The first thing you will notice as you watch this film, and be distracted by, is how much Washington sounds like his father, Denzel Washington. Once you get over this, the story draws you in."
Does an insult carry the same weight of a physical assault?
"Lubitsch sees the round of coincidences as a game of cruel destiny, albeit one that's played on the world stage against a backdrop of looming war."
"Every year, there are a handful of pleasant and unpleasant surprises in multiplexes. Count Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle among the former."

American Made sure makes zipping around in planes loaded with ill-gotten jewels seem like a lot of fun.
&#46;&#46;&#46;Even though Unbreakable&apos;s superhero side is shaky&#44; Shyamalan&apos;s fourth film is ultimately a success&#8212;as best seen in the strength of the Dunn family story and a genuinely exciting climactic fight&#46;

"Teenage casts an intoxicating spell, but in the haze of war and underground dance parties, it doesn't have the time to help us understand what the hell it all means."
Superhero films are rarely imbued with this level of emotional resonance and gravitas&#44; and even though it doesn&apos;t reach the heights of the original Black Panther&#44; it&apos;s still head and shoulders above the MCU&apos;s other post-Avengers&#58; Endgame offerings&#46; 
"Holly and Marina may not always be good for each other, but together they tell us a great deal about people who need each other -- a group that ultimately includes all of us."

"[VIDEO] ""The Mill and the Cross"" represents the closest any filmmaker has come in the age-old pursuit of translating a painting into a living, breathing, cinematic context."
Skyscraper is one of the most idiotic action movies to come down the pike in some time. It's also a lot of fun if you're willing to go with it...

It is the work of an artist; every shot is carefully composed.
"On every level, ""No"" leaves one with bittersweet feelings about democracy, love and the cost of compromise."

Odd feminist fun.

Heath Ledger is great.

A towering landmark for filmic fictionalizations of the Holocaust.
Maddeningly episodic.

This whizz-bang breakthrough in mixing live action with cartoon characters won a special achievement Oscar for animator Richard Williams.
"It would be funny if the surprise ending was that the newspaper just folded so the reporters had to abandon the case. I mean, someone still has to pay for their efforts. Exposing conspiracy and defending the public interest isn't free."

"These young people are a spirited bunch, led by Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, two bright-faced newcomers who lend the proceedings the appropriate sense of grounding and awe."

"New Order is a bold film that will continue to divide viewers and critics alike, but ultimately, if it forces more discourse on the vast and growing disparity between the rich and the poor, maybe that's exactly as Franco intended."
"May not deserve the adjective of the title, but Vega certainly does; her performance makes an imperfect film worth seeing."
The action scenes are spectacular. But the slightly jumbled story and mob of new characters pulls focus from what makes the film work the best -- the original group of costumed characters.
"It is a true auteur creation that is absurd and exhilarating, a fun-house mirror reflecting our times and the folly of women who seek to control a patriarchal system by submitting to it."

Affleck has smartly gone and selected a place which he knows well and a source text that assays it with skill and no small sense of moral complexity.
Hopper&#44; as director and uncredited writer&#44; extends no hope whatsoever&#44; and there&apos;s something vital and cleansing about the movie&apos;s thorough nihilism&#46;

More of a historic novelty than an action film.

"A joyous, generous-hearted romantic comedy that, even as it veers into difficult terrain, insists that we just need to keep on laughing."

"

"In its own way, it's a movie with plenty of imagination, but the gory progress from fight to fight to fight is monotonous, and the running time is quite demanding for those of us stuck with finite lifespans."
Sword of Trust is rich with humor and heart with a sophisticated edge of snark.
"An insightful and very sorry tale of the worst kind of greed, this Oscar-winning documentary exposes the people behind the global financial crisis, men & woman who are still wealthy and still running the banking industry."
Something that must be seen to be believed; a visionary achievement in filmmaking that delights the eye and the mind alike.
Casablanca is like fine wine--the film only gets better with time.

"Plays like an analysis of a corker of a tale, picking its story apart and laying all its parts bare to see if it can be viewed from another, possibly more vital angle."
Luhrmann eschews the stripped-down plodding and formulaic approach that many historical biopics follow and focuses instead on what he does best&#44; his ability to excite and entice&#46; With frenetic and pulsating almost religious moments&#44; he utilizes pop-like
A clever and big- hearted gay screwball comedy.
An exploration of decadence in American culture. As beautiful as it is tragic.

"Rodd Rathjen pulls no punches in the depiction of the concept of modern slavery, in a film that frequently switches from documentary-like detail to a mainstream narrative, a tactic that actually benefits the entertaining aspect of the film the most"
Put this movie on your must see list and enjoy a truly uplifting sports story.
"Part product placement, part really insane produce placement, and part something else -- mayhem, mostly, with a side dish of running amok -- The Lego Movie is an unusual, sometimes brilliant film."
"While The Batman is far from the best or most consistent cinematic outing for the caped crusader, the film is still undeniably strong with one of the more poignant reflections seen regarding the character and his impact."

"Even though I've heard quite of bit of his show before, I still enjoyed it."
The Fabelmans may be a light&#44; average film that&apos;s not particularly memorable&#44; but thanks to an exceptional ensemble and an intriguing story of how a cinematic genius got his start&#44; it becomes well-worth the somewhat lengthy two and a half hour investment&#46;

... a playful romantic comedy about six characters in search of love ...
"A charming and humorous re-release, but this entire experiment feels more like an alternate viewing mode on the Blu-ray release than a fully-fledged theatrical release."
"Whether or not certain events played out precisely as we're told, the urgency of Polsky's cautionary message is inarguable."
A rapturously seductive slow burn watch.

"Oscillating between mild humor and navel-gazing pretension, Brad's Status is a road movie about fathers and sons that sporadically lands when it stops taking everything so seriously."
"Fantastic fun, though with so many superheroes jostling for position it's hard to delve deep even in 2.5 hours. There are plenty of jokes, some hilarious, some endearingly clunky. Brolin imbues Thanos with remarkable depth."

Codirectors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders understand more about visualizing the joy of flight than James Cameron ever will.
"Hugely startling, challenging, and mesmerizing, perhaps even a masterpiece."

John Wick has been a boogeyman&#44; the Baba Yaga&#44; an enigmatic cypher in the vein of so many cinematic assassins that came before him&#44; but most of all&#44; the franchise points out&#44; he&#8217;s simply a man who loved&#44; and was loved in return&#46; 
"160 minutes represents a heavy investment in time and popcorn. But the unrelenting pace, almighty effects and sheer tongue-in-cheekiness make it more than worth your while."
Josh Brolin is terrific as Mannix. I chortled and laughed through the whole thing. And I smiled for hours afterward thinking about it.

Samson and Delilah is impossible to ignore.
"The characters are drawn in broad strokes... Yet with Ryoo giving the action a Spielbergian sweep as the action builds towards the climactic prison break, you'll find yourselves rooting for them all the same."

"Doomsaying about independent films... is this year's favorite kvetch, and yet movie hand grenades still manage to get tossed into our laps with astonishing regularity. Lynne Stopkewich's Kissed is a startling example."
A slick and suspenseful landing until it fails to stick the landing.
There's lots of interesting stuff to chew on...it's never less than compelling.

"Endless is far from a masterpiece, but it largely works for what it is and is elevated as a whole by a wonderful central performance by Alexandra Shipp."

Only the Brave might be the best movie ever made about firefighters.
"Benedict Arnold: Hero Betrayed may not make you want to petition for an Arnold monument, but it will get you to see this much maligned historical figure in a new light."
Easily classifiable as one of the top ten films of all time.
Emasculation paranoia is alive and well.
"Refn is definitely a provocateur, but those audiences who enjoy being provoked should probably decide if they love it or hate it for themselves. We'll both be right."
"As good as the first two films were, as well as they redefined the action espionage thriller, the third film falls victim to its own innovation."
"[It's] a gleefully silly affair in the tradition of Dumb and Dumber. It's also a comedy where the old adage ""your mileage may vary"" holds a lot of weight."
"Everything that happens in the film feels ripped from reality and, as a result, it hits hard in a way that few films are able to manage."

"Intoxicating and meditative by turns, helped by Fred Frith's minimalist score, this film opens a portal into a singular creative mind."
The Last Picture Show (1971) is an evocative and bittersweet slice-of-life 'picture show' from newcomer 31 year-old director Peter Bogdanovich

Fascinating use of children as metaphor.
&#8220;Three Thousand Years of Longing&#8221; is a fun little diversion&#44; but it falls well short of leaving you wanting more&#46;

"Not many character-oriented thrillers like this get made, however, so it's nice to be able embrace the ones that do, if you can handle the eccentricities."
"It's just a little too jarring to be top notch, but it sure is powerful."
Um grande exercício de lógica e técnica narrativa.

Each of the actors smoulders with quiet strength.
It&#8217;s a truly great blockbuster&#44; one that surpasses the earlier theater release in every conceivable way&#46;

The intense invention and creativity at work in this extraordinary movie is overwhelming.
"The superb cinematography and art direction deserve praise, but they could shorten the middle part of the story."
"In his debut, Barratier proves himself a capable director, one with a gift for handling those most mercurial and unreliable of actors, children."

"Not your typical jump scare ghost story. Instead a quiet, slowly-paced character film that is worth a watch."
"LaBute's films have much to say even if they can be overwhelming. Unlike action films you forget in an hour, his movies will stay with you for years afterwards, provoking thought and reflection."
"Mildly compelling and amusing, but somewhat uneven and dull. The sexy Trieste Kelly Dunn invigorates the film in a radiant, charismatic performance."
"Terrifically spooky and original, the film continues to feel completely modern despite being almost a quarter-century old."

"Paranormal Activity isn't an actor's film per se, but it wouldn't be as eerily effective without Featherston and Sloat's believable, lived in performances."
A cinematic safe space for conservatives to escape the tidal wave of indictment/impeachment news they have a hard time avoiding on TV.
There are two moments during the second half of Mel Gibson's Hacksaw Ridge when I literally jumped out of my seat in terror.

"Even if the last third of Amy is painful to watch, Kapadia takes care not to lose sight of the human being behind the mythology."
"Like many of Scorsese's earlier pictures, After Hours has a fascination with the bizarre. But the new film is lighter in spirit than any Scorsese film, with the possible exception of Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore."
Modestly amusing teen summer comedy.

"Less a horror film than a valentine, from a daughter to a father, and a sweet portrait of a man going gently into that good night."
"Combines a few lovable Hollywood icons, an admittedly goofball plot, some sweet-natured romance, and brilliant rapid-fire exchanges of breathless comedic dialogue."
"Yamada and crew almost go so far as to suggest that the Japanese had their A-bombs coming to them, if it weren't for the achingly sympathetic family at the film's core."
The full force of Obayashi's preference for the experimental makes itself felt.
"Page One is an insider's view, but if it isn't raking up any muck, it's not a love letter either."

Fun to watch!

"Unusual in that it is a five-hander, it has some very good performances; Paul feels very solid, Gadon is subtle but strong, and young Longworth does a good role justice. It's an unusual but accessible film."
"If a bracing brew of criminal connivance and exquisite bloodletting is to your liking, Takeshi certainly provides it."
"""Love is making someone who is sad feel happy,"" one girl says, answering an interviewer's question. ""Blood Brother"" showed me that love. I doubt I'll be the only one."
"A lively, soulful documentary that lacks sufficient insight into the life of Youssou N'Dour."

"It is a well crafted film that could have been a little shorter, but there are nuggets of brilliance in the acting."
Don't miss it. [Full review in Spanish]

The Jungle Book is everything it was expected to be and so much more.
You know Quentin Tarantino is probably over the hill when he can be so parodied with such deadly precision in Shoot 'Em Up.

"It was gripping, it was invigorating, the action was so cool!"
"This movie is a time-filler, something you can have on in the background while you're doing something else, and can glance at whenever the shooting starts."
"It takes a little while to get going, but once it does The Festival is a funny take on a British summer institution."
It feels human. It is human. And it's the best film of the year.
"Tom Hanks does a superb job of carrying Cast Away all by himself for about two-thirds of its running time, but isn't much helped by additional characters in the opening and closing sequences."
"This summer's blockbuster offerings may be setting box office records, yet seem like holograms when compared with this weighty offering."
"Young@Heart's vocals are playful, but essential. Even the youngest of spectators are impressed by the liberating flamboyance of the chorus."
This is a meticulously constructed story that presents its characters with a series of exponentially more complex moral and practical dilemmas as gripping as the perilous situations that threaten the mission.
But something strange happens once Drew Barrymore shows up -- the movie starts getting good. Really good.
"It has enough incendiary elements to grab your attention, but the mishmash of influences can't quite hold it."
"Though there's nothing particularly new in the Hellboy narrative, it's easy to be captivated by del Toro's style and the film's overall panache."
"An intelligent, action-packed thriller, made on a modest budget with no mega stars? Phew! Didn't see that coming."
Norman unfolds with the elegance and intricacy of an O. Henry short story.
"A sprawling, ambitious, major work -- a gripping exploration of power, personality, technology and the crushing weight that can come to bear on those who find themselves in its combined path."
"If The World of Kanako is ultimately difficult to wholly dismiss as simply an extended wallow in escalating unpleasantness, much of this can be credited to Koji Yakusho's performance."
"Ambitiously gorgeous and deeply personal, Roma is one of the best films of the year and deserves your full, undivided attention."
"Despite a predictable story and some awkward visuals, Giant Slayer is surprisingly entertaining - thanks to a hefty dose of well-timed humor and energetic performances."

The ending feels at odds with the rest of the film.
...a wonderful time warp movie with pace and style.
"Not content with a basic premise of crime and punishment, director Bong Joon Ho goes a step further, eventually corkscrewing off on a tangent that drags out the running time."
Turn your brain off and turn up the blood splatter.
"It just about works, but it's a long way from perfect."

Superlative Australian neo-noir has everything you'd ever need for a delightfully dismal tale of deceit and murder.
"In an age where every film is getting a remake or a reboot, Pet Sematary might actually be better than the original. It's terrifying, twisted, heartbreaking, morbidly funny, and a hell of a fun time."
Stare all you want at this motley crew of misfits because they give us sentiment and entertainment in return.
"Like Joker, Parasite brilliantly explores the haves vs the have nots and how it's becoming an explosive situation. A masterful piece of filmmaking by Bong Joon Ho."

"Sam Eliott's ""Old Soldier"" story has more going for it than a catchy title."
"Aside from Shepard's wonderful work, there is a real sense of history here."

A handsome and stirring film of Second World War ingenuity that also succeeds as cracking good entertainment.
Best for older teens and their parents.
"Segal's version is no sports-film watershed, either, but it is consistently entertaining, athletically brutal, and, more often than not, well-acted."
"The film, like the beleaguered country it depicts, has a raw, neurotic, brawling yet tender vitality."
"Away From Her isn't just a portrait of Alzheimer's. For a generation that doesn't have a lot of marital role models, it's also a lyrical portrait of what it means to stick with a person for the long run. There are no easy answers."
"Farhadi is one of those filmmakers whose personal style is as steadfast as Marvel's: allowing for a few cosmetic tweaks and squeaks each time, you generally know what you're going to get. And generally, it's very good."
"Mr. Bertino, who also wrote the undercooked script, sets the scene effectively, using his leads to give the story a sense of normalcy that he dismantles trick by genre trick."
"The late, great playwright August Wilson, whose ten plays dealt with the lives of African-Americans in different decades, would have radiated warm support for this unabashedly theatrical movie."
"Filled with casual betrayals, divided loyalties and enough story to spawn a franchise, The Villainess roars along like a runaway train and is a brilliant showcase for Kim, who kicks sand in the face of any Hollywood bad girl."
The performances are simply wonderful.
"Brilliant filmmaking, creative and visionary--no wonder Leos Carax won Best Director. my favorite movie screening in Cannes. Full review to follow..."
"The filmmaker is up to the challenge, staging some taut action sequences and seamlessly weaving together live action with animated elements and tons of visual effects."
"It is a relaxing film to watch, austere and comforting in such a way that Zoo's aural components will become unexpectedly, uncommonly troubling."
"These dizzying IMAX 3-D visuals truly are big-screen magic, taking us inside Petit's transcendent experience as he navigates his preternatural path, indulges his showman's flair, and - agh! - reclines to commune with the heavens."
Creators Dean Fleischer-Camp and Jenny Slate run the gamut of emotions ranging from hysterical laughter&#44; surprisingly poignant thematic moments&#44; and heartbreaking devastation

"An icily slick and funny Florida urban thriller in the style of Carl Hiaasen, carried with great deadpan style by Paige."
"A great role for a truly great talent, who just happens to be in her 70s. The movie is just under 90 minutes, but Tomlin delivers in that short time. Her wise-cracking one-liners are tempered by a real sense of loss and vulnerability."
People is an utterly fascinating watch.
"It's in parts painfully earnest, never more so than when Ruffalo sees instruments come to life while Knightley plays alone onstage, but it moves along at a nice clip and the recording scenes are shot well."
Adults who go to The Lego Movie out of a weary sense of parental duty are in for a very pleasant surprise.

"Diggs' charisma goes a long way toward drawing the audience in. We're rooting for him to succeed. And yeah, his dopey friend, too."
Bogart and Hepburn are truly amazing together.
"Most of what Mr. Tyrnauer serves up is not news, but to have it all in one place is to immerse oneself in a bilious lesson in history."
"With its mix of melancholy moments, abrupt violence and broadly played buffoonery, Zatoichi is very much a Kitano movie, yet he still treats the genre with respect."
Character study with a thoroughly European sensibility..the true pleasures are Clooney's study in stillness and Corbijn's striking images..a beautifully restrained performance.
Director Ron Howard and writer Akiva Goldsman have reached the apex of their careers with Mind.

"Ten years later, it's still flawed and still quite fascinating."
"At one point, Jude Law says, ""I find this disgusting but I can't help myself."" Me, too."
"Moors is neither showy nor exploitative in his telling of the story. He just lays out the details, making ""Blue Caprice"" not just a story of horror, but of tragedy."
"A delightful storyteller, Troche comes up with wholly unexpected and consistently effective bits of visual punctuation and she has a subtle way with sensuality and a secure touch with non-professional actors."
A violent movie about the routine as a safe place and how this one lack in our everyday life. [Full review in Spanish]
"Shooting in crisp black-and-white and with sparse dialogue (on title cards), Berger creates gorgeous scenes that evoke not only the silent era but early '30s horror (including a reference to Tod Browning's Freaks that's oddly endearing)."
"This seventh film in the Planet of the Apes series rises to such ridiculous heights, it's impossible not to laugh out loud -- in a good way, in appreciation."
"Though replete with amusing situations and clever lines, its strongest suit is the delicately pitched comic performances of its actors, most especially star Kevin Kline."
"Along With the Gods: The Two Worlds is an inquisition into human flaws, using Ja-hong as a vehicle to explore how they can be redeemed as such."
"""Catch Me"" feels capable of charming the masses with star power, a pop-induced score and sentimental moments that have become a Spielberg trademark."
"Chadwick Boseman is so formidable that, were the film itself just a bit better, he would eventually be basking in the same sort of year-end accolades that greeted Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles and Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash. Who knows, he may yet."
"It's a breathtakingly beautiful film, never mawkish, never less than vibrantly real and never more affecting than when it explores the nature of a love that 'dare not speak its name', not in Nazi Germany"
"A simple story worth watching for its depiction of prejudice and discrimination Mexican Americans experienced in Los Angeles. Not a perfect film, but a movie worth your time for the simple fact that in the 1950s these stories were being told."
"The wonder of this explosively funny, tautly dangerous movie is that it's without a single false note."
Hood knows how to crank the tension and a certain fury ticks under the story.
"Slesin, who's already won an Oscar for her documentary, ""Ten Year Lunch: The Wit and The Legend of the Algonquin Round Table,"" should at least be racking up another nomination with this sterling effort."
"""Try Harder!"" puts human faces on the college admissions fiasco, prompting viewers to empathize with overachievers unaccustomed to failure and whose self-worth is inextricably tied to which universities they get into."
"In spite of the pervasive melancholy, ""Stan & Ollie"" also carries a sweetness and dignity that ennobles its subjects. A lot of that has to do with the warm performances from Coogan and Reilly, who disappear into their roles."
One of the insights writer-director Johnson brings to the movie is a political and cultural awareness of what is going on in today's society - a denigration and suspicion of outsiders.
"The characters aren't much more well-defined than the anonymous victims of a teen horror movie... The dinosaur effects, however, are absolutely stunning, and sometimes so natural that one even forgets to be impressed."
"You might cringe at some moments, but you'll also probably laugh and maybe even have a good time. I'd watch this for 24 hours straight before watching Fan4stic ever again."
"Like its star, it's quietly sincere and compulsively watchable."
"Matsumoto and Mitsuyoshi Takasu trade the grand for the gargantuan, the battle-drama for the video game fight."
"...whole-heartedly casts its lot with the grown-ups in the audience, paying homage to Sergio Leone, Carlos Castaneda, Hunter S. Thompson, and Roman Polanski's Chinatown. ...So, let's dispel the illusion that this movie is for kids."
The new singing animals adventure feels more mature in every way. [Full review in Spanish]

It's a thought-provoking film.
"There's the overall feeling of hard work not quite paying off, but the gorgeous and game Chastain quietly salvages everything she can."
There are so many delightful little touches and warped bits of storytelling that I can't imagine anyone who won't love this film.
"There are questionable plot hooks and discordant character changes aplenty, but all is well thanks to a buoyant song score and flawless performances from all involved."
"The cast is terrific. Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman and Tony Shalhoub are familiar faces, and look so out of their depth in the middle of all this silliness that of course we find ourselves smirking."
Brigsby Bear will reaffirm your belief in the positive powers of imagination.
A solid Christmas-themed dysfunctional family drama is enlivened by its superior cast of fine Latino stars.
"It's a very tasteful heart-tugger - a drama of disarmingly level-headed empathy that glides along with wit, assurance, and grace, and has something touching and resonant to say about the current climate of American bullying."
Beneath the viscera and grue is a tender and affecting tale of first love and discovery&#46; It&#8217;s as elegant as carnal and carnivorous&#44; and it&#8217;ll take a bite out of your heart if you let it&#46;
"Talk to Her is a sad falsetto ballad, holding onto hope like a dove cupped in two gentle hands in the midst of blood-splattered bullhorns and slow death."
"It's a crazy amount of ground to cover, but only rarely does 13th sacrifice clarity for cinematic energy."
"A hard-hitting film, The Nightingale never quite reaches the heights its aiming for."
"Genuinely inspirational on many levels, this film was a surprisingly emotional ride on and off the track with another pitch-perfect outing from our national treasure Sam Neill."
THIS is the good version of the crime saga.
"The camera in The Bike Thief stays focused on the grim geography of working class life, its narrow confines and regimented rhythms."

"A doozy of twists and turns moving from elation to heartbreak to the dark corner of existential dread, Wardle's film works best if you know nothing."
"Fauci has an actual structural focus that's smartly considered and interesting, even if it left me with myriad questions."
Sean Penn does a great job.
"Equal parts sultry, humorous, and heartbreaking, Hustlers brings a needed female perspective to an industry poorly portrayed by Hollywood. Constance Wu and Jennifer Lopez are a lock for Oscar nominations."

"Scott manages to fill in the finer brushstrokes of all those characters and still fit the kind of bravura action set pieces he's known for; the fight scenes are breathlessly, bone-crunchingly brutal."
"This is a dizzyingly inventive, postmodernist exercise in breaking down cinema's 'fourth wall', Keaton playing with the possibilities of the medium and cramming an unbelievable quantity of gags and ideas into the film."
The Wind Rises undoubtedly stands out as a film with an incredible amount of passion and inspiration behind it&#44; bringing to life a story that stays with audiences and engages them on a deeply personal level&#46; 
The filmmakers aren't championing ignorance... Those on insisting on seeing this as taking sides in the 'debate' over evolution are missing the point.

"Death in Venice occasionally suffers from Visconti's artistic overindulgence, but the film's strengths are also paradoxically tied up in its helmer's unwavering eye for detail."
"Despite flaws (it's overlong and too theatrical, betraying its stage origins), this stylishly made cat-and-mouse thriller with strong social class overtones boasts great performances from Olivier and Michael Caine."
"What makes this such a moving family drama are the complicated characters that this talent cast creates, and the relationships between them it so effectively explores."
Anyone with a weakness for song-and-dance dementia on the level of Forbidden Zone and Cannibal! The Musical will find all this irresistible.
"This comedy of a boy and his talking bear - which plays like a long episode of ""Family Guy"" - is basically like watching Seth MacFarlane and Mark Wahlberg hanging out. Happily they're both pretty funny."
Amusing documentary duel at the video arcade.
"Strange and a little awkward, ""Secret Window"" nonetheless is worth a look."
"When a movie is written and filmed as part of the writer-actor's effort to save his own life and slim down, the movie feels, to a certain extent, critic-proof."
"Se acerta ao trazer um Bond mais amadurecido, amargurado e auto-consciente, peca terrivelmente por elementos que beiram o trash, como alguns efeitos visuais pavorosos e uma atuao sensual, mas absurda, de Janssen."
"The story is programmatic and the indie stylings feel tired but Handsome Devil is a winning, enjoyable call for individuality."
"Shyamalan demonstrates a mastery over the form of the mean and lean psycho-thriller, aided in no small party by the performances of McAvoy, Taylor-Joy and Buckley, and smooth-yet-unsettling camera work by cinematographer Michael Gioulakis."
This haunting coming-of-age film is set in a country that itself is coming of age.

"We're just pleased to have a family film in the truest sense of the word, one that's genuinely hilarious, touching and inventive to both kids and their parents"

"The 1962 version, starring Emmanuelle (Amour) Riva, is superior."
The delight and the exasperation of Eureka come from the same source: its willingness to take its time and explore every detour.

"This is finally a film that is better at mood than substance, that has its strongest hold on you when it's making the least amount of sense."
"Leave No Trace is a slow burn, and carefully constructed; the performances are measured and calm. There's no need to overplay the drama - the circumstances presented here are serious enough as they are."
"One of the great crime thrillers, the benchmark all succeeding heist films have been measured against, it's no musty museum piece but a driving, compelling piece of work, redolent of the air of human frailty and fatalistic doom."
"It's certainly a Spike Lee film, but no Spike Lee Joint. Still, he's delivered a pacy, vigorous and frequently masterful take on a well-worn genre."
Jeong sensitively gives her film an underlying sadness as the young women cope with the changes in their lives

Its ability to take audiences to a completely different land and time may remind them of how they felt when they saw Star Wars or The Wizard of Oz for the first time.
"Smart, sardonic and more than a little silly, Iron Man is a successful super-hero movie that never takes itself too seriously."

"Broly sets up what could be the next phase of this Super era. If you've ever in your life loved anime and especially if you've watched Dragon Ball, go see this movie while it's in theaters and enjoy yourself as much as Goku enjoys fighting."
It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
"The special effects are more of the psychological nature, with nothing evil shown clearly but its presence always pervading."
"Anchored by Owen and Kidman, and delivered with a larger than expected scope by Kaufman... Hemingway & Gellhorn may not be literary, but it's a satisfying accomplishment."
"The Original Kings of Comedy is all about truth -- about love, family, work and life."
Suitably giddy with its horror-movie platitudes aimed at mocking the facade of suburban hysteria...this thriller thrives with the right amount of scrappy charm and intrigue.

"As sober as a lab report, the excellent documentary metes out its findings with calm precision."
Hair High is the actually the artist's most cohesive 'story' to date...which means it's only about 35% weirder than any other sort of animation out there.
"This blue-collar ""Ocean's Eleven"" is a smooth-running, pleasantly familiar crime caper. In a movie full of cons, the greatest may be how deceptively easy Steven Soderbergh makes the whole enterprise seem."
"...basically just sits there for a good long hour before it picks up any sensible speed. Is it all worth it, though? In ways."
[An] interesting exercise in style. [Full review in Spanish]
"The contrast between two very different characters who get along so well, is what makes ""Cha Cha Real Smooth"" an extremely charming experience. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Finds Soderbergh keeping it simple, stupid, by filling the story's hollowness with kick-butt action and elements of style."

A documentary that mixes advocacy journalism with the suspenseful thrill of a caper.
More than anything&#44; this documentary is a celebration of Blades the Musician&#46; His talent and contribution to the genre of salsa cannot be underestimated&#46;

Nothing about this film feels remotely safe.
"Unlikely premise, yet script offers dialogue, heart-tugs, actual intelligent thought and a fair and necessary reflection on the State elections in the Union. A pleasant film."
"Cooper is superb, hard as granite, dense as an imploding black hole."

"Chris Sanders and Dean Deblois have crafted such a smart and sassy tale, it would have been solid even if the central characters were stick figures."
"Knowledge is power, but in Everybody Knows, nobody's quite certain about the whole truth."
"Regardless of whether you recognize the names of Christopher Isherwood or Don Bachardy, this masterful documentary draws you into the men's lives like a star-studded bedtime tale."
"While Caught won't abduct everyone's attention, it's a strange, unique, and intense indie that will be welcomed by both sci-fi and horror fans alike."
"Take it for what it is: An old guy who gives himself one last juicy role as the flawed, haunted anti-hero, an old guy who's done this so often that he isn't above making himself look silly as well as heroic (he even croons the title song over the ending c"
"It's a slow effort, painfully so at times, but the reward is a sharp psychological study that ends up being the most interesting conflict in the movie."
Boogie Nights for Gen Z...
"Parts of the film are frustrating, and downright suspenseful, because Marija earns our respect while no one else gives her any. Thanks to Jaktait&#279;'s bracing performance, we know she also internalizes this hard-earned truth."
"Very violent, mostly in comic-book terms."
The cast ... manages to give thoughtful performances that salvage the film's integrity.
"The Fly seizes on our ingrained, instinctive horror of sexuality, the sense of shame that our fundamentally puritanical society can't help but teach us, and by confirming our worst fears, helps us, for a moment, to move beyond them."
"Ghosts of the Ozarks is not groundbreaking or ushering a new kind of terror, but it does have an impressive premise, worthy of appreciation in the wealth of knowledge of the genre, making it an independent horror film worthy enough to seek out."
"Melissa McCarthy gives the performance of her career and Richard E. Grant is terrific. Director Marielle Heller has a keen eye for detail from the bookshops to the bars, the film is bathed in authenticity."
"Although imperfect, it's engaging, thought-provoking stuff."
"The lean story-telling works well for its taciturn characters and spare settings, presented by cinematographer Amundsen, and well scored with assistance from Mastodon."
The Forever Purge is another powerfully political piece of action horror art from the hit franchise&#44; drawing on our current social strife for its scares&#46;
"All the participants are earnest, some a bit quirky, but Stephenson allows us to judge them for ourselves as this amusing, low-key suspense yarn unfolds"
The strong conclusion ensures that the film ends on a somewhat powerful note...
A classic gets even better.
"In some ways, Coppola improves on the original film, but at the very least the different actors make for a different dynamic."
"Room 237 is a fascinating study of what fans of the film believe, and it's an entertaining look at that world-especially if you're not immersed it in it everyday."
"It's hard to resist a satire, even when it wobbles, that insists the most unbelievable parts are the most true."
Close to an XL for me. It's a sequel that uses a rehash of storylines and characters that still actually held up.
"I'd rank being stuck in a big quiet house at night as one of life's most easily unnerving experiences, and this movie capitalizes on it."
No franchise like Scream has to constantly reinvent itself with meta narratives while also keeping direct connections to its original installments&#46; Scream VI is a mean&#44; nasty&#44; rollicking good time at the movies&#44; just as Wes Craven always intended&#46;
"It may not make total sense, but Déjà vu is a highly enjoyable, superbly made thriller. Like me, you may want to see it again"

A unique and exotic work of art that strikes a universal chord.

"Despite these frustrating moments where The Witches of the Orient feels designed for a different audience, one which doesn't need to either race to catch up or be calmed into tranquility, the story of the Japanese volleyball team is undeniably remarkable."
"Captures a raw and honest look at the feeling of being trapped in a life you never asked for, wanting so desperately to get yourself out of it, but realizing that you're probably stuck there for good."
"A clever, enjoyable movie, with enough thrills and laughs to keep all ages entertained!"
"As freewheeling and irreverent as the man himself, Saint Misbehavin' is that rare documentary whose flaws seem appropriate for its subject matter."
a wickedly funny and stylish take on a childrens classic that conjures family fun with a typically dark Roald Dahl edge. 
"A collage of emotions, shifting through scenes that are happy, silly, angry, sexy, even sad."
I seriously love this movie.
"A naturalistic, chat-heavy narrative that captures the difficulties wrought by the unimaginable trauma individuals face as they attempt to forge connections and find peace after war."
"An increasingly rich and accomplished comic still works for his laughs, with edge, antic energy and polished stage patter."
"""Spider-Man: Far from Home"" isn't really a superhero movie. It's a wholesome teen comedy disguised as a superhero movie."
This all-too-familiar gloom and doom tale is depressing and feels longer than the 104-minute running time. The acting is top drawer from the powerhouse cast of respected thespians.
"Deftly written by Richard Curtis and directed by the versatile Mike Newell, Four Weddings is as good as its word, breezily following a small circle of friends through every one of the events the title promises."
There are still good vampire movies being made. Like this one.
"At its core, watchable."
The Second Coming on a trash heap.
A moving documentary for the ages and a reminder of Gilda Radner's greatness both as a comic and as a human being.
A story that tries and often succeeds in transcending its particulars for a story about the personal and political struggle to come of age.
"Between an elegant ""pas de deux"" and a simple, as well as painful, sprain. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Technically, Scott has consistently demonstrated that he ranks among the best popular film artists. Unfortunately, Scott's film doesn't work for me as well in other areas."
This place is less crossroads of the world than land of confusion.
"The impact of Peter Jackson's King Kong is as massive as the gigantic gorilla itself, a spectacle to marvel at, but most importantly, a story with which we can connect emotionally."
"The story, about a young soldier who is torn between leaving the army and loyalty to his brothers at arms, is affecting and well acted ..."
"The microcosm Delmer Daves creates here would make Billy Wilder pause, and the final five minutes are a masterstroke of nihilism."
Zombieland&#58; Double Tap is perfect for fans of the original&#44; especially in keeping its focus squarely on original characters but the film isn&apos;t perfect overall and it&apos;s hard to say it will pull in new fans&#46;
The scenery is beautiful and it is a fun ride along with Emily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson but it is no African Queen.
Probably the most visually dazzling film Pixar has ever made.
The irresistibly wicked humor of this film is firmly rooted in despair. We can all relate.
The movie somehow finds something new and meaningful to say about art and life and the region of shades between the two. 
"Plays out with frightening, gripping logic, each new step and new realization suddenly appearing like a cold sweat."
"A pastoral romance based on an earlier version of Lawrence's novel that is softer and can stand on its own terms, despite lacking the class distinctions that would distinguish the final version."
"When I think what sentimental tripe The Queen could have been in the hands of amateurs, I bow in gratitude to all concerned."
It takes only a glance at Julie Ledru&#44; the star of &#8220;Rodeo&#44;&#8221; to convince you to go for the ride of Lola Quiveron&#8217;s ferocious feature debut&#46;
"Though it never hits action movie nirvana, if you can get past the intentionally OTT gross-out factor, Repo Men is a serviceable and entertaining sci-fi yarn."
It may move you to tears -- you'll also bust a gut laughing at his dialogue-recording scenes from Aladdin and stage-show improvs -- but this important documentary about the last days of actor Robin Williams is must viewing.
"Wonder Woman ends with a sequel on the horizon, that will certainly get made if the movie inspires little girls to ditch their Disney Princess regalia and learn to scare off creeps with the raise of an eyebrow, the Gal Gadot way."
"It's a fascinating bundle of contradictions--authentic in a million details, deeply romanticized in others. Cool, calm and collected, this is more love story than gangster picture."
"It's a pleasure to see a movie about people in their 50s, assessing their lives as they deal with the long farewell of a parent."
"In its broad strokes, Glory gets at the spirit of a group of previously unsung black heroes, and the filmmaking is of a high caliber. [Blu-ray]"
"For journalists and people who care about democracy and the value of open society, Spotlight is a master class on how things should be done."
"It's pure-strain Bong all the way through, surprising and unsubtle in all his appealing glory."
"A slow-building, well-done, rather melancholic film, Mountain treats the life of an Orthodox Jewish woman, Tzvia, whose family lives in a dwelling adjacent to the Mount of Olives cemetery in Jerusalem."
"The film is a meticulously, perhaps even cynically crafted crowd-pleaser. Even those alive to its tactics might find themselves wiping away a tear or two."
"I can't say the found-footage format of Chronicle was particularly impressive, but the rest of the film is a minor revelation."
"By tying it back to characters that don't seem popped from any too-familiar mold, the film allows its sense of regret, its alarm at time passing, to feel earned."
"Black Widow isn't the best MCU movie. It's not really in the top tier, really. And it doesn't offer as many broader connections as we might like. But as far as popcorn-munching action-packed cinematic adventures go, you could do a lot worse."
"Though the subject matter could've been developed into a more challenging and provocative yarn, this film's chief aim is escapism."
Pollack does right to put his faith in one man and a whole lot of mountains. The result is impressive.
"We've all stared up into the dark, knowing we can't really conceive of what we're looking at."
"This sprawling portrait of the Red Army Faction... is neither an apologetic for the anarchist gang nor a condemnation of it, but rather a fascinating exploration of the shift in the zeitgeist of that era..."
The pole position in the race for the next Best Animated Feature Oscar has clearly been staked out.
"A total celebration of theatre, history and politics."
"In this summer of raunchy, hilarious R-rated comedies, Virgin fits right in--even if the one-joke premise gets a little stale towards the end."
"A crime of cinematic passion, a daring attempt at replicating a famed artist's visionary style in animated form, and a somewhat plodding detective story told in wheezy old narrative tropes that violate an often ravishing technique."
"Deadwyler gives a career-making performance as Mamie, perfectly poised between grief and strength. The film, which is dedicated to Mamie, ultimately belongs to her."
"Martin Scorsese's dbut feature has just the slightest bit of story line, but the movie is a fascinating portfolio piece: a black-and-white blueprint for ""Mean Streets."""
Mostly enjoyable and only slightly too long.
A clever blend of psychological thrills and stalked-by-monster terror is what makes writer-director Neil Marshall's sophomore effort a cut above most horror films.
"MacIntyre and Chris Lee Hill's screenplay is rife with absurdity, glorious carnage, jet-black humor - and best of all, a solid relationship at its core."
"""Last Christmas"" is that film that fits neatly between spasms of holiday shopping, when you want to just get away from the mall madness for a couple of hours."
"Fern hits the road in her mobile home initially to pick up work in a gargantuan Amazon warehouse, a symbol of 21st-century postmodernity as dehumanising as any 19th-century cotton mill or factory."
Romeo Must Die scores when it concentrates on Li's fast footwork and flying fists.
Sends chills down your spine.
"More daydream than nightmare, The Craft: Legacy delivers an enchanting outing that honors its origins while maintaining the ease and self-awareness characteristic of a timelessly great scary movie."
It's as hilarious as you can imagine. [Full Review in Spanish]

"Ms. Vreeland has paced her documentary well, a chapter to each era, with hundreds of beautiful images spanning decades of artists, galleries, parties, scenes."

What's so lovely here is Manuel's warmth and humanity - the way he lives with regrets and disappointment.
The minute you hear the Downton Abbey theme it's like coming back home. Director Julian Fellowes out did himself with a marvelous transfer of the beloved series without skipping a beat on its essence. Maggie Smith's quick wit is absolutely fantabulous
"What's amazing is the mixture of willpower and uncertainty, mendacity and credulity, gracefulness and self-conscious posing that [DiCaprio] conveys, even before you see him speak."
"Paced with the deliberate restraint and discipline of a seasoned poker player, the film is clinical and unflinching in its execution, its impact incremental yet lingering."
"War is hell; Winter Soldier shows that this was true of the Vietnam War, only more so."
"However you read [Queen & Slim], there is no other way than to think of it as a time bomb, one which you are never prepared for when it goes off."

Shapes a standard prison-break drama into a metaphysical study of freedom and reparation.
"Challenge all viewers and gives them plenty to ponder after the credits roll, the lights go out and they reach the parking lot."
"Manages to overcome the triple threat of a new director, being a prequel, and being the third film in a series. This really is a pretty terrific addition."
It&#8217;s a traditional sci-fi horror picture that doesn&#8217;t break new ground outside of its slick advertising trick&#46; But is it really trying to break new ground&#63; I would argue it&#8217;s trying to make a fun&#44; intriguing &#8220;Cloverfield&#8221; installment&#46;
"22nd Century Women is irreducible ... although certain adjectives and adverbs do leap to mind: generous, reflective, absolutely delightful."
A wild and wicked film that should make anyone think twice before grabbing that Egg McMuffin on the way to work or 'treating' their kids to a meal almost engineered to make them sick.
McDormand is incredible here and deserves the attention she's been getting. This film does shine a light on an important issue - I just wish it hadn't put quite such a positive spin on it.

I couldn't help but enjoy myself in the theater.
The the picture is more than a wink-fest -- it's often blazingly funny.
"A whole lot of movie, but it's also technically mature filmmaking to a thematically juvenile end."
"Paradise Now is an agonized inquiry into the minds of a dispossessed new generation of Palestinians, who come off more introspective and internally divided than you'd think."
The desperation for human connection in a place where no one belongs is palpable - and the willingness to humor anyone unusual is part of it.
"Paints a portrait of the women's moment of the 60s & 70s, writer/director Lissette Feliciano's creatively crafted film validates those times' struggles & heartbreak. Strong performance by Lorenza Izzo."
"A western that exudes beauty everywhere in a very well told story (like everything that A24 does). With a minimalist narrative, First Cow transmits a lot of peace and serenity. [Full review in Spanish]"
The usefully horrifying documentary Taxi to the Dark Side follows a map that leads to the notorious prison abuses in Iraq's Abu Ghraib to policies in the Guantánamo Bay detention camp.
"It's mildly affecting, but nowhere near where it should be."
It's a difficult task to implicate an audience while simultaneously entertaining them.

Brilliant! I can't wait to see it again!
The film chillingly hints at how deep the region's problems may go.

"Episodic doc could use more focus on food preparation, but vividly captures the human element involved."
"The character design on the animals, is expectedly top notch and vividly detailed, with all of Baloo and Bagheera's scars telling a number of stories."
"Yet another long, meandering, talky French film may not be your first choice for escapist entertainment. But there's some terrific stuff in this one."
One of [Godard's] most entertaining movies is also one of his most timeless.
Hilariously outrageous action scenes and asinine dialogue ultimately overshadow the layers of political and social commentary.
"This scrappy little film is informed with a lot of truth about not only the Viagara-ridden porn business, but obsessional human behavior."
"""Keep An Eye Out"" is an uproariously funny film filled with slapstick humor, inventively quick-paced dialogue, and an off-kilter story with one surprise after another."
"Truly remarkable - a history lesson, a mea culpa and one last chance to discuss a pivotal era with someone who was actually there."
The conversations it provokes will probably be more enjoyable than the ones it depicts.
"A striking debut, cinematic and affecting."
"...a non-stop, high tension thriller that doesn't let up until the end."
"It's often dirty, yes. But it's also manic and inspired."
There's almost nothing here beyond the opportunity to watch two veteran actors play off one another -- and it turns out that's enough.
... had Armstrong never been accused of doping would Gibney's film still have its original title?
The remarkable debut from writer-director Michelle Garza Cervera is as effectively blood-curdling as it is intellectually incisive.
"Like a great bluesman, Moonlight's Barry Jenkins finds poetry in the lives of people struggling to surpass pain and cruel circumstances, often choosing beautiful images over words."
It delivers more than its fair share of jump scares and knows when to bail out.
"There is much to admire here, but the sheer scope of the subject matter might be even better served by the capaciousness of a mini-series."
"The central performances by Taylor-Johnson and Cena stick to the life-and-death business at hand, which is also the stuff of blood, sweat, some tears but not too much corn."
"The crazy-quilt quality of these immigrants mixing it up with Southern rednecks like William is deftly underplayed, and so it has more resonance for us."
"This groovy, green, not-so-mean movie kickoff to the Christmas season will delight children and remind grown-ups why Dr. Seuss still rocks."
Takes a provocative subject -- friendship and love between a Jew and a Muslim -- and makes it seem natural and wondrous.

The best date film of the year.

The only thing that I know for sure has ended with the Marvel Cinematic Universe is my patience.

A gross-out comedy that makes its audience go 'awwww' as much as it goes 'ewwww.'
"Ducournau may have changed tack here, but it's another impressive, thought-provoking piece of work."

"In Nighy, the witty script leaps to life, in a tour-de-force of darkly downbeat comedic timing..."

Topics that could make a sailor blush - but lots of laughs.

"The Hunt for Planet B delivers a captivating viewing experience, showing the sometimes-thin line between science fiction and the true scientific future."

It's a social and political commentary of a modern day industrial power and the polarisation and inequality prevalent in most developing nations.
Phoenix's performance overwhelms the slight story.
"Lighter and loopier than Bogdanovich's key '70s pics and naughtier and rather more cynical than his woofy What's Up, Doc?, She's Funny That Way is certainly amusing for the first and second acts."
"With its jittery stop-motion animation, exquisitely detailed shots, and outwardly self-aware characters,[it's] the epitome of artifice. It's also as bright and cheery a time as you'll have at the movies this year."
A powerful and atmospheric film that delivers a barrage of images and concepts of both sexual and philosophical natures.

"Like another Australian musical by a then young director, Gillian Armstrong's Starstruck from 1982, Bran Nue Dae carries the day with energy and self-belief."

"The film overextends itself a little as twist piles upon twist and in terms of narrative it's not entirely successful, but as a masterclass in microbudget film-making this is well worth a look."
A touching film that perhaps spends a bit too much time digging in the wrong places.
Sexy and wry.
In short&#44; it&apos;s hard to take any of this seriously or care very deeply&#44; but it&apos;s equally hard to deny that some fun -- guilty perhaps -- is had in the process&#46;

"It's a film that deserves to be seen, be discussed and win awards."
"Normally I'm not averse to time-shifting in movies, but in this case I found the device unhelpful. Individual scenes are superbly staged and the cast is flawless, making the film essential viewing for lovers of the book."

A tribute to how entrenched the Rugrats are in our hearts.

"Stirring film, capable of moving you even as it gives you a new perspective from the past on an issue that continues to plague us, here in the future."
"Rock's script isn't afraid to get raunchy, sometimes a little too much, but there is a bit of heart at the center. Dawson and Rock have the chemistry to make it work, even when it feels a little contrived."
"Up until the last 20 or so minutes, Split is a tense, tightly directed thriller that would probably have ended up among my favorite movies at the end of the year."
"Hilarious, fast, funny, fresh fun for the family."

This is a movie with bruised shins and a huge heart.
"In some ways, this is Art House 101 stuff -- the kind of movie you just know is good for you, because it's so dull and depressing.That, however, is merely one aspect of it."
"You can feel your brain melting away as you watch it, and that's not always a bad sensation."
"The director introduces an interesting framing device, interviewing his main characters dressed in plain clothes and facing a camera, the full significance of this reality-show type setup only becoming apparent at the end of the film."

"Obscuro Barroco privileges other ways of knowing: a material engagement with the world that neither fixes nor categorises, but makes space for new becomings."
"Offsetting the chilly voyeurism is a viable teen romance and an appealing sense of humor. Though there are occasional lapses in logic, Disturbia is consistently suspenseful and entertainingly disturbing."

"The truth is, the DC Justice League version of Captain Marvel is a lot of fun, mostly family friendly (except for a monster biting off a guy's head), and just a tad too long to earn an extra 50 cents in yours truly's money-tinged ratings system."
"[Quentin Tarantino has] whacked history over the head and cut away all the boring bits, leaving behind a blood-drenched war epic like no other."
"A challenging and topical consideration of the queer experience, filtered through a racialized 90s lens. Bowyer-Chapman is great and while Spiral doesn't have the supportive gay relationship some viewers want, it's still valuable LGBT representation"

"This is a compelling drama, with some interesting characters. It is a story worth telling and movie worth seeing, because this could happen anywhere. I am surprised it hasn't happened in more places, especially in the United States."

Bardem gives what might have been too slow and plodding a movie its heart and its humor.

Super 8 is the cinematic equivalent of unearthing a time capsule and finding everything inside is still impossibly shiny and new.
TRON: Legacy may be the best movie I've ever seen that possesses a truly awful script.

It&#8217;s easy to see why many love this picture but just as easy to see why many despise it&#46;
"Most films dealing with illness and carer relationships follow the same emotional paths and miss the same points. This film, by contrast, feels fresh and real even to those of us who have been there."

"The movie is by turns a historic document, a milestone of queer filmmaking..."
"Schorr's delightfully deadpan comedy debut blew away the German box office, and once you let yourself sink into its gentle rhythms ... you'll see why."
"Possessor is cold, nasty, brutal, extreme and provocative."
"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever succeeds as a new adventure, and as a tribute to a wonderful actor who was taken from this world decades too soon."

Shear entertainment.
An uplifting and enriching cautionary tale about one man's spiritual adventure on the road and in the wilderness.
"Screenwriting teachers will tell you that if you don't hook your audience in the first 10 minutes, you've lost them for the full two hours. Director Duncan Jones and writer Ben Ripley have crafted a thriller that does it in only eight."
"It's contrived, but that doesn't keep it from being kinda nifty."
An experience sometimes hard to endure but not to be missed.
"You see how brilliant an actor Clift was. You see his love of the art of storytelling, developing characters with depth and dimension, and his willingness to put the final product over his own ego."
Kidd's wickedly irreverent and succulent narrative cunningly cuts to the quick in the way it examines the boorish behavior of male mischievousness that ultimately serves as the needed comeuppance to redefine their consciousness.

"If Selznick's story isn't remarkable, Haynes and the cast ... breathe enough soul into it as compensation."

This is a radical retelling of the old fairy tale. Traditionalists will be shocked by this version but there is all new humanity in it.

"The movie's plot, intricate as it is, is secondary to the chemistry between the two stars."

"Sections of Malick's expansive, fitfully brilliant, occasionally sloppy film are so powerful that you can only gaze up at the screen in wordless awe."
"Marvelous and the Black Hole never unwraps from its dissection of grief, but still offers a joyous backbone that serves its narrative well. The film will leave you feeling emotionally fulfilled and is a poignant example of how magical cinema can be."

A breathless thriller that doesn&#8217;t let up from minute one until the very end&#46; 
a slightly over-sweet teen classic
"The film is one that's easily enjoyable for those who are and are not fans of Wonder Woman because it is ultimately a story about strength, perseverance and love - three elements that Professor Marston made sure his character truly embodied."

"The film's brand of Americana is pretty, but very Hollywood: hard scrabble but not hard won."

"Nolan has shown a new way to tell a superhero story, and it may turn out to be the only way to tell a story about heroes in this troublingly amoral time."
"Lowbrow plus highbrow does not equal middlebrow, and the breezy accessibility of Private Fears in Public Places does not make it any less a work of art than Resnais's more difficult early successes."

Hector Babenco's sprawling portrait of Brazil's criminal class exudes a throbbing flesh-and-blood intensity so compelling that it's impossible to avert your eyes.

The relationship between the talent-challenged Will and the punishing Green makes for one of the film's meatier dramatic threads.

Engaging romantic fable about a young man who fulfils his destiny by falling in love with the woman of his dreams.

"In this instance, Black seems intent on catering to as many different types of nostalgia as possible."

"Alex Kurtzman, in his directorial debut, delivers a compelling and emotional dramedy about a man who discovers he has a sister he knew nothing about."
"Kim Horton skillfully weaves together clips from past films - the participants' lives inside a fishbowl literally flashing before our eyes - and both Apted's narration and his gently needling, off-camera interrogations give you all the context you need."
"Though predictable and often preposterous, this warm and funny wish-fulfilling fantasy is a richly rewarding ride."

The subject&apos;s thoughts count more than the plot&#46;
"A tantalising, sometimes frustrating parable about the menaces that human beings might face from unexpected quarters."
"Fresh feminist horror of a very welcome taboo-smashing kind. Nasty, hilarious, outraged and outrageous, and as poignant as it is blackly funny."
"Director Cathy Yan (Dead Pigs, 2018) knows how to use the broken character as a narrative tool very well, and finally, gives Harley Quinn the movie she deserves. [Full review in Spanish]"

Touches are just enough to earn The Good Shepherd a third star. But De Niro might want to stick to acting in future.

"22 times hotter, 200 times smarter than Fifty Shades of Grey."

"Carax's film is a cousin to ""Synecdoche"" and a modern response to Rivette's ""Celine and Julie Go Boating."" He even appears to have anticipated Cronenberg's ""Cosmopolis,"" answering the questions set forth...as to where all the limos go at night."
Very much a film of two halves.

Was Die Hard 4 taken? I know that there are better minds in Hollywood than this that come up with a more appropriate and not so annoying title.
&#8220;Uncharted&#8221; really leans on its star power&#44; especially Holland who plays a very Holland-like character &#8211; charismatic&#44; boyishly charming&#44; a bit daffy&#44; and with an unshakable innocence &#40;even when he tries to talk tough&#41;&#46; 
"In Mark Of An Angel the misdirection is sometimes subtle, sometimes not so, but director Safy Nebbou in the end deserves the benefit of the doubt for just about preserving credibility when the plot goes into a wild reverse skid."

"If only all debut films were like this: story, style and substance."
The greatest Steven Spielberg movie since the last great one? Sure.

A muddled tale of a corporate high-flying huckster brought low.
Even tweens will enjoy this road trip with Goofy.

"In the nicest possible way, Saint Frances is a Lifetime TV movie that has a degree in feminist literary theory."
Strictly for unreformed lovers of very French cinema and lovers of the very nostalgic.
"An astonishing, overpowering piece of rabble-rousing, consciousness-raising, epic-scale filmmaking."

"We know how the story closes, of course, but MacDonald tells it with verve and sensitivity..."
"It's overlong and it's message as subtle as a sledgehammer, but a great cast makes this frantic prom worth attending."
"Either as public relations or as therapy, it looks like a dodge. But as art, ""Honey Boy"" is kind of brilliant."
Jeremy Gosch's documentary about the origins of professional surfing shines a light on four wave riders -- three Australians and a South African -- who helped transform a counter-culture life style into a billion-dollar industry.

"My only reservation about the movie, not a serious one but a nagging one, is that watching the film it's hard to see why the Coens wanted to make it."
This is a lively affair with treats for fans and a barrage of entertainment for all.
"A flashy Robin Hood-ish drama of female empowerment, Hustlers is recommended viewing."
"most of the chase sequences feature more jiggle than you'd get in a ""Three's Company"" marathon. As her astounding exercise regimen shows, Lara treats her body like a temple; many will worship it."

'Are you wolf or sheep?'

"It's more of a relationship drama, one that works as a showcase for two great performances against a post-apocalyptic backdrop that ups the stakes..."

Baumbach perfectly captures the atmosphere of a childhood marred by emotional fisticuffs.

A striking view of a neglected generation...
"Eddie Murphy is a genius, the original is arguably the funniest movie ever made...not a bad movie, but more nostalgic than funny, a cinematic greatest hits package...surprisingly heart-felt, and the fans won't mind the films flaws..."

Arctic is as charming as it is instructive.
"Judd Apatow has a history of hyper-reflexivity, turning his films into ruminations on his own world. His latest Pete Davidson-led project, though, suggests a conscious effort to change..."

It's just a stunning look at professionals doing a job most people would run from and doing it very well.

"Taut as a tug-of-war rope, timely corporate thriller ""Money Monster"" has not an ounce of fat on its slickly efficient, exceptionally self-assured bones."

At the foundation of this movie is a great script.

This is as full a picture of Marley as is likely to emerge.

[A] potent drama about the lawless slums of Buenos Aires - it feels like The Mission with all exoticism firmly excised.
"""Nobody Else But You'' has a great deal going for it, not the least of which is Rouve, who takes the novelist's obsessiveness, depression and general boorishness and turns it all into the source of his appeal."
"Elegant, often moving."
"In both a very literal and abstract sense, A War represents the universality of the human condition when put under extreme pressure and the lengths one is willing to go to in times of despair."
It is well-made and engages with one of the chief anxieties of modern people: What if we've been the villain all along?
"Avoids a misstep common among girl-empowerment flicks, which often emasculate the male lead to make the heroine truly heroic&#133; manages to make both leads appealing."
"Sethi's film plays along with some pretty familiar rom-com tropes. There is a definite throwback to 90's romantic comedies like ""Harry Met Sally"" but it also has a slight Bollywood-like edge that bestows it with oodles of charm."
"Nightcrawler doesn't err cautiously but on the side of discomfort, and you have to admire that."
"Arresting and heart-stopping, Number 37 is a fiercely acted and directed tale of the intense mayhem that can be born out of anger, desperation, and sheer entitlement. The buildup alone is worth the ride."
"A genre-bending story of bullying and social media, Sissy is equal parts slasher and coming-of-age film with a different type of happy ending that will leave you on the edge of your seat."
"Moronic set-ups sap the fun factor... yet, Keeping Up with the Joneses still functions because it delivers something we continue to crave on the carousel, where the Kardashians and Joneses of the world will always be on the horse ahead of ours."
"Better still, [MacDonald] has made an indubitably powerful (though not perfect) film."
Those who haven't seen it since the '70s may find themselves amazed all over again by its lyrical potency and grace; those who have never seen it may wonder how it can be that a film this great isn't shown somewhere all the time.
John Wick: Chapter 2 is one righteous MOFO of a movie.
There's a bit of a sense of Bourne style action except you can follow it.

"Wilde keeps itself at a remove from its passionate, flamboyant subject, and kept me from gaining any new understanding."

This is a powerfully acted ensemble that effortlessly has conversations with one another&#46;&#46;&#46;A film whose female lens was necessary behind the camera since only other women would understand what it&#8217;s like to live in a patriarchal society
"It's one of the savviest Australian comedies in years. Which isn't to say that it isn't also incredibly stupid, because it most definitely is. And that's the entire point."
"""The Batman"" has the teeth to impress any of the opposition and eat their hearts out in the process."
"Sumptuous filmmaking at its most flashiest, ""Il Divo"" may distance some people but I found it to be riveting."

Kate Beckinsale is reason enough to go see this movie.
"Loving is a first-class actors' picnic, with the advantage of having real-life meaning in the always-thorny arena of American race relations."
"Knightley winningly portrays the arc of a fighter. Colette is ultimately a feminist tale, but never one that wallows in self-pity or seriousness. It is also carried along lightly by a script with a streak of wit ."
"It's not nearly sophisticated enough to match the complexity of its characters, whose labyrinthine romantic entanglements have a truthful ring to them."
"Journalism is all about having the courage to write the truth even if it will get you mocked by your relatives and co-workers, so here goes: Space Chimps is hilarious."

"There are so many tonal shifts, big laughs, awkward laughs, long silences, explosions of anger, and cuttingly clever jabs that your head will spin (mine almost spun right off my neck)."
"A thick, rich slab of American cheese. As bad-taste comedies go, this is more clever than gross..."
"I was so caught up in its genuine, unsentimental Christmas magic that I forgot to be snide and sarcastic and cynical."
Distills a non-fiction book about the influence of fast food on the global cultural landscape into a narrative film that touches on the many of the points and populaces of the book.
"The script administers a relentless string of laughs, most of them genuinely funny."

"Like the novel, Lean's meditative, graceful film laments and marvels at the mysteries of human behavior."

"The new comedy Baby Mama never comes fully to term, as it were."
"This movie, set in India, along with 'Nuevo orden' (2020) of Mexico, are both effective cautionary tales of the inherent dangers posed by income inequality and corruption. This is a danger in America as well, but nobody is paying attention, yet."
"A fine film that proves the past is never too bleak -- or the future too hopeless -- to discover a productive new life, and a home and family to share it."
"One of the great strengths of Farewell Amor is its intimacy, the sense it conveys of three people close together yet emotionally distant in Walter's small, narrow Brooklyn apartment. Another strength, and a huge one, is Mr. Mwine's portrayal of Walter."
"Hardly a massive gamble, Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher play a safe romcom hand you can tolerate."
"In its slow-moving, at times uncomfortable way, this is a heartwarming film."
"What could be dismissed as experimentation is instead framed with care and kindness as a first love, woozy and meaningful, bringing this fantasy world somewhere universal."
Another one of Leigh's rare but perfectly rendered period pieces.
"In this majestic setting, heavy with symbolic imagery, Lowery brings Gawain's tale to a conclusion seven centuries in the making. It's a daring piece of work, and an invitation to step out of the circle, to walk a new path, to write our own story afresh."
"Once we know them a bit, Rose and Teddy are decent company. The dilemmas that brought them to where they are at present are credible and the acting is good."
"Ted's Boston-accented zingers are expertly delivered by the director/star, whose voice talent is undeniable, and Wahlberg again demonstrates that he's skilled at comedy ... Seyfried proves adept as well ..."
"Paddington isn't just the film of the year, it might actually be one of the finest family films ever made."
"Though the sky might be falling, ""Thunder Road"" swirls about the tragicomedy of Officer Arnaud's plight with ease. It's hard to really forge a film that can wreck you and play with such liveliness."
"It's hard to deny the fact that, all this considered, it's a work of art, even with that title."
This is very good piece of filmmaking.
"This is the movie puts the ""oooh"" back in ""boo."""

The Break-Up is more like Annie Hall told with Chicago attitude and work ethic.
"The film is always watchable, and the confrontations contain undeniable edgy excitement. But even if this weren't a remake, it would be a remake."
All of this material is so chilling and effective on its own that the movie's emphatic music and computer-generated graphics... can feel like overkill. But these flourishes serve the film's ultimate objective...

An eye-opening feature debut by Matt Spicer goes straight for the jugular with its lacerations of social media and what he sees as his generation's dive into unmitigated narcissism.
"Whatever its flaws, the film gives you no chance to get bored."

&#8220;Babe&#58; Pig in the City&#8221; is a wonderful family motion picture that touches various topics&#44; but doesn&#8217;t live up to the power and overwhelming brilliance of the original&#46;
"The Disappearance of Alice Creed begins with a van being stolen and ends with a different stolen vehicle being driven away. In between comes a tight, efficient thriller with just three actors and at least two whopper switcheroos."
"Where the original was defiantly not a concert film, but a chronicle of the astonished hubbub surrounding the first hipster folksinger, the follow-up's treasure lies with seven intact live performances."
"The film ends up being very nearly as good [as House of Usher], and better in some respects."
The Nightshifter is at its best when it's focused on the more grounded reality of Stênio's life and the very real and violent world around him.

"Regardless of whether or not the film means anything at all, it is a triumph of visual imagination, production and set design and costuming."
"Extremely well crafted and scripted ... Fun, propulsive, ingenious and quite loveable."
"Most movies of this type re-create the action far from the actual scene of the crime, but Macdonald has invented a new subgenre: a docudrama in which the docu and the drama are equally authentic."
"A war story that takes no sides because it takes all sides. And it's a period piece, set in the last decades of the 12th century after Christ, that resonates in a thoughtful way today."
"It matters little that the film is rife with non sequiturs, nonsense and nihilistic violence, because its heroes are so darn buoyant and charming."
"Eternals has the expected thrilling action scenes but the non-action scenes might be too quiet and introspective for some fans ... However, the showdowns in the last third of the movie make up for the meandering story in the rest of Eternals."
"""POM Wonderful Presents: The Greatest Movie Ever Sold"" is the movie Morgan Spurlock was put on earth to make."
"The movie sucks the audience into the power of the confessions, then shows us what really happened."

"An enjoyable, if flawed sci-fi thriller that's worth seeing for Fassbot and Noomi Rapace."
"Beattie has made a rousing directorial debut that could and should become a monster international hit. Marsden has written a further nine books about Ellie's exploits: bring them on as films, I say."
"Disney is also releasing this movie in a new Dolby digital projected 3D format. If a theatre near you offers this, check it out in this format for sure."
"Short Term 12 races by with its brief running time, but its ambling plot works to reveal a naturalistic discovery of its characters."
"In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared down and very original affair."

Pain and Glory wants to be 8 1/2 but seemed to me about six-and-a-quarter.
"If you didn't like Before Sunrise, filmmaker Richard Linklater says, you'll hate Before Sunset. But if you treasured the original, you're sure to prize the 'romance for realists' sequel."
Even the recurring passages of pin-drop silence generate edge-of-the-seat dread.

"A stern editor with a sense of dramatic timing could have given this film more tension to go with its random bursts of comedy and big, happy fantasy setpieces, but lacking tautness, it'll have to settle for expansive joy."
"[A] brisk, engaging documentary..."
"Jurassic World is a roaring return to form full of laughs, scares and inventiveness that almost (but not quite) matches the achievement of the original."
The main reason anyone should check out Split is to marvel at McAvoy's breathtaking performance.
"If you want to see ""Force Majeure,"" rent it and stream it. If you want to see two terrific comic talents circling around it in something lighter and funnier, then ""Downhill"" it is."

"Mann's first movie with feeling; his overwhelming love of its subject will turn audiences into exuberant, thrilled fight crowds."
"Witty about social pretensions, eloquent about failure & loss, acerbic about family, Allen's light-handed tragedy is a major work. Blanchett is dazzling as the fragile heroine."

A gonzo doco for the new media age.
"Peers empathetically into a tiny world and opens it up for its audience, who, in turn, will surely open their hearts to it."

Gibson keeps this movie afloat.
"For a movie that lasts longer than two hours and is made up solely of talking, it's impressive that the story never seems to drag."

"Ultimately, though, it's the music that really matters, and Hackford certainly doesn't deny his audience that pleasure."

"Heinzerling has a great eye, and his conventional, low-key approach to cinematography in Cutie and the Boxer-no shaky camera, very few tracking shots, and adequate lighting-puts all the emphasis on his subjects."
A complex film that sidesteps every cliché. Paul Verhoeven and Isabelle Huppert are at the top of their game.

The Maze Runner is better and more tightly constructed than a simple cash-in. It's a well-paced adventure-thriller with an intoxicating sense of mystery and the chutzpah to take huge leaps with its fictional world.

Will bring back a lot memories for anyone who lived through the space race.

"Wright's screenplay has a third act problem, where the revealing of the whats-and-hows aren't as interesting being lost in the whys."
"Winchester '73 is simply one of the finest Westerns ever made, in a class with the best of Ford and Hawks."
... the distraction-free bubble focuses the story on the key players and their emotional motivations to achieve maximum impact... (but) the real villain of this story is human fragility.
Adler's screenplay is excellent; it isn't often that a film takes an insightful look at how people can become unraveled.
A formidable actor's showcase.

"At once gossamer and purposeful, it's Terrence Malick with a map."
"As much as I respect Climates, I can sympathize with viewers who will balk at the film's pretensions and glacial pacing."
"Arriving at a bleak time in modern history, the unbridled enthusiasm and playful attitude found within this film gleefully provide the perfect escapism we're likely all craving."
"While not everything here works, this is a poetical and distinctive effort whose commentary ultimately seems to go beyond gender relations to indict humanity's abuse of nature, and suggest an apocalyptic end result to climate change."
"Ultimately, rather than sex, what seems threatening here is impending adulthood in all its dimensions, and in its floaty, insubstantial way, It Follows catches some of the mingled excitement and terror of growing up."

"Every bit as funny as ""Analyze This."""
"I love the straightforward gall of Frozen. Here's a horror film that's confident enough to abandon superficial scares in favor of a far more insidious, intellectual concept"

Why Did I Get Married covers a lot of emotional and cultural ground in its two hours.
Murder Mystery&apos; 2&apos;s  script is ok for the most part&#44; but nothing one wouldn&apos;t expect from a murder mystery&#46;

"Stewart's strained stoicism bounces nicely off of Maadi's winningly garrulous performance, which he has to give almost entirely through a small window in the door of Amir's cell."

It's hard to recapture or exceed that magical feeling of seeing something new and unique as the first Incredibles presented itself to be. Incredibles 2 is such a worthy sequel that it certainly warrants another sequel to become a bigger franchise.
"It's both a lesser Shane Black movie and a lesser Predator movie, but it's still a Shane Black Predator movie."
...heartfelt and poetic...
"Jon Jost's most accessible work imports the lyrical camera of his film essays and the violence inherent in his Western to a poignant, wistful meditation about the discrepancy between art and spiritual decay."

This is an amazing movie.
Dany Boon is like a mime you don't want to shoot.
"[""Daddy Day Care""] is a straightforward, don't-expect-any-surprises kind of pre-summer entertainment that has a good supporting cast, precocious kids and a premise that lends itself to slapstick comedy."
THEM! was one of the better Fifties science fiction films and one of only a handful that are still fairly effective forty years after it was made due in large part to some very intelligent script choices.

Taxi Driver is a cinematic masterpiece and Scorsese&apos;s best direction of his career&#46;
Redford and Newman provide the real sting.
"It's uplifting and inspiring to see a coach who brings out the best in his girls. Like the documentary Hoop Dreams, this turns out to be a whole lot more than just a movie about basketball."
Material like this is only as good as the acting and writing. The Ref is skillful in both areas.
"Whenever Jarmusch lets his soundtrack - and his stars - do the talking, the right notes get struck."

An appealing romantic drama that proves it is never too late to turn your life around by taking a risky leap into the dark.

I was ensnared by its stoner charms.
"Expect nominations all around, with actor/writer/director/producer and songwriter Cooper on the verge of a boatload, maybe even for contributing to an eclectic, sure-to-be-soaring soundtrack."
"A nice mix of old-fashioned imagination (anagrams, pranks, secret spaces) and newfangled effects (gizmos, gadgets, graphics), it's a rollicking, never obnoxious family flick."
"Silly, surreal and squeezable, SpongeBob scores again."
"""The Descendants"" goes on too long, but that's its only flaw. And frankly, I can see why Payne and his editor decided to go with this print instead of making some awfully tough decisions."

A fascinating account of a man who loved stirring the pot until he was the one sitting in it.
"What works best in Anne Rice's books are the depth of characters and their psyches. Which is also one of the hardest things to incorporate into film, and notably absent..."

"There's no reinventing of the wheel here, but an authentic, enthusiastic and well-observed continuation of the universe."
Equally provocative and profound&#44; On the Count of Three tackles an often ignored conversation with the gravity it deserves&#46; 
"Avoiding the sensationalism that would have come so easily, the skill with which Meyers varies the tone of My Friend Dahmer, as he takes us from humour to darkness and back again, is simply compelling."
A picture of cultural displacement and Anglo-Indian rapprochement almost worthy of EM Forster.
"A thoroughly entertaining, mischievous comic romp."
"In terms of intellectual and emotional stimulation, who could ask for more?"
It was all the things that you want from an M. Night Shyamalan movie.

Another masterpiece from Wim Wenders and Sam Shepard.
"I can't say that Rat Film is a cheery experience, but it's certainly an indelible one."
"The film finds its strength in the quintet of lesser known players, especially Zapruder and, oddly enough, Oswald's stoic brother, who's cast in a heroic, almost Kennedy-esque, light."
&#8230;with no body-horror&#44; gore or even effects&#44; Schroeder does a remarkable job of maintaining grown-up narrative tension&#44; and the pay-off is surprising satisfying&#8230;

A stylish if somewhat disjointed film.
"It's dysfunctional, but strangely affirming."
The fact that it&#8217;s such a standard&#44; nothing special&#44; screenplay is a letdown&#44; but the aerial scenes are first-rate&#44; and the actors are believable&#44; even when saddled with tired cliches&#46;

"Remarkable! A small, intimate kind of movie that deserves to be cradled and cherished, not slathered in crass award-show buzz and industry politics."
"With churning performances and a terrific recreation of the period, the film is a startling story of a woman caught in an impossible situation. So it's a shame that it's rather muted."

"There's such a graceful sense of restraint in how this real-life tragedy is treated, one that filters any potential for ripped-from-yesterday's-headlines sensationalism through a respectful requiem of loss and grief."
It's a good fit for anyone who loves fine acting.
"Kite Runner remains an effective, deeply felt meditation on forgiveness, and when it stays near the characters, it's some of the best filmmaking Marc Forster has ever accomplished."
One of the things I liked best about the film is how it is grounded in the grim economics of the newspaper and recording industries.

Remarkably subtle and perceptive straightforward narrative on the rise of French fascism.
"The forceful script is shuddery, steadily building to an astonishing courtroom showdown and a devastating finale, where heartbreak and agony are certain to cloud redemption."

"While not quite reaching the compelling, claustrophobic and queasy heights of Das Boot, director Aaron Schneider (Get Low) does an excellent job of thrusting the viewer into the cramped conditions and chaos of life aboard the Keeling."
"Deadpan funny drama, played against a minimalist backdrop, brings home some simple truths about the desperate lives most people lead."
"... a humble curtsy to the Echo Park area of Los Angeles, to Chicano resilience and the Mexican rite of 15-year-old girl virgins having a lavish party debut of adulthood."
"Occasionally, the dialogue clunks but a winningly vulnerable performance from Marinca goes a long way to building up a picture of a compromised world of political horse-trading where even war criminals can get away with it."
... a beautiful piece of work.
"This is not just the first feature by Haifaa Al Mansour but the first feature to be directed by a woman from Saudi Arabia. That is quite a burden, and yet by some miracle the movie bears it with lightness and grace."
The push and pull of this movie is really between the lead character and the audience. One moment we feel compassionate: he wants to do the right thing. The next moment he's gone down the cover-up rabbit hole and is an irredeemable swine.
"For the most part, Tamhane improbably succeeds in creating a damning courtroom drama that derives much of its power from observing the cogs in the machinery when the machine is switched off."
"This is an exceptionally thoughtful, striking horror picture with an all-time great Nicolas Cage performance at its core. Mandy is the reason midnight movies are a thing."
"Bright and eager to please, it reworks themes and situations from teen films of a generation ago in a manner that makes a surprising amount of sense today."
...my favorite of the three.
"In Happy Family, the acting, like the humor, is over-the-top. But in particular, it was hard not to enjoy watching Teyana Taylor's Sabrina."

"Teens should eat up this fantasy's scenery-chewing angst and doom, and the hopeful tale of survival and empowerment (to be continued in the inevitable sequel or sequels)."
"Director John Stockwell takes a thin concept and executes it with a certain level of maturity and skill, not to mention a gorgeous visual touch."
"Roy Andersson's specific aesthetic on full display--an overcast blue-gray world of personal horrors, disappointing inanity and compromised beauty reminiscent of philosophical, art-cinema sketch comedy. Works better in context with his other movies."

Surprise hovers over this dry-roasted and altogether compelling Irish comedy-drama like a creature waiting to stun the cast of the movie into submission.
One of the more quotable comedies of the 1980s
"A small-scale indie with bountiful ambitions, this resourceful debut ballasts a great deal of conceptual idiosyncrasy ... with strict observations of personality, behavior and the textures of space."
The most adventuresome element in The Wackness isn't its pop-culture skin but the unlikely friendship of Luke and Squires.
"Private eye mysteries are so rare these days - indeed, the form is almost extinct on the big screen - that the film ends up feeling surprisingly fresh."
"...it delivers its knowingly unrefined thrills in a smart, engaging and not unpleasantly ruthless way, and never lets its cheekiness get in the way of its creepiness."
Another John Grisham book forms the basis for another decent (if not dazzling) courtroom drama.
A wry humored cop thriller.

"Director David O. Russell's film is dragged down by a confusing tone, but makes up for it with a satisfying look at the way Mangano built her business empire from the ground up."
"It follows a pretty familiar arc, but it hits the required beats with style and a couple of surprisingly well-considered performances."
Becky is a breezy blast and a gnarly genre gem that horrifically turns the plot of Home Alone on its head&#44; with terrific turns from Lulu Wilson and Kevin James&#46;&#10;&#10;
"Fahrenheit 11/9 is all over the place, but that general sense of fear Moore displays for the future gives an otherwise boilerplate effort a true sense of emotion."
"It does such a thought-through, empathetic, and powerful job of exploring homophobia as part of a root-and-branch mentality in South Africa's white patriarchal psyche."
Amusingly silly horror flick with better than average production values
"Peter and Ethan are not people you'd care to have sitting next to you on the shortest of bus trips, let alone a 2,000-mile car journey, but Downey Jr and Galifianakis make Due Date well worth the ride."
"The raunchy comedy is the equivalent of drinking a poolside margarita while the kids are at camp. It's a load of empty calories -- but, boy, does it go down easy."

"Scorsese may not wish to be known only as a crime dramatist, but when it's something nobody else has ever done as well, why complain?"
"Rude, crude but often delightful and fresh business farce."
"The stories feed into each other, helped by some subtle writing and restrained performances, and the drama slowly deepens."
The shards of this film have more audacity and intelligence than most of what is out there and its failures are more interesting to ponder than most films' successes.
"A superb sports film, based on the best-selling book by David Peace."
"With the same anchor of family and hope in the younger generation, Peninsula is a worthy follow up to Train to Busan, if a little more of what wed expect from a typical zombie action film."
"Majewski's filmic voice isn't for everyone, filled with lengthy tableaus without obvious meaning, but it's strong and truly unique."
Interesting remake on an Argentinian film that works thanks to Sandra Echeverra's and Arath de la Torre's charisma and on screen chemistry. [Full review in Spanish]
The sort of film that the word &quot;charmer&quot; was made for&#46;

Riz Ahmed's superior acting chops take a dark turn.
A good and enjoyable surprise. [Full review in Spanish]

A perfectly amiable and often funny animation feature aimed largely at children but not childish or pandering in any way.
23 Jump Street on TV is a drama. The movie no way takes itself seriously. That helps. Lots. So does an R-rating where the characters are free to -- uh -- express themselves.

With &#8220;1917&#8221; Sam Mendes takes his audience on a perilous journey driven by a simple but tightly-wound story soaked in an unending tension&#46; It&#8217;s a harrowing tale of heroism&#44; friendship&#44; and sacrifice&#46;

You don't have to know about music to appreciate the film's easygoing blend of comedy and romance.

Gives a wonderful behind-the-scenes look at the theatre business

A terrific feminist take on one of the most popular characters in British history.
"The script, penned by Mohler and Brittany Shaw, doesnt reach the excitement of a court drama and honestly lacks tension throughout, but the film is salvaged by the performances of its leads and supporting cast."

"a genuinely wonderful film that, despite its atypical source, finally gives [Patricia Highsmith's] writing its deserved work."
John C. Reilly's work is Oscar-worthy.

"When absorbed into the series as a whole, this chapter supplies some of the most thought-provoking, sophisticated thematic content to ever find its way into so-called ""young adult"" science fiction."

"Brooklyn's Finest is a realistic, disheartening and brutal look into the lives of three different cops at three different stages in their careers."
"Where The Lodge succeeds is in its patient atmosphere-building and downer psychedelic style, delivering neatly staged and effective shocks."
"The latest in a series of work about the cost of the refugee crisis and human migration, For Sama is a harrowing experience and certainly one of the most essential films of the year."
"Consider the $4,970,802,499 its quintet of leads has made for Paramount at the box office as long-held escrow on a legendary prank. Robert Downey Jr. is all wild-eyed brilliance, Tom Cruise is re-christened in cool and the film is comic gold."
"While the comedy is sometimes broad, it avoids the need to humiliate its main characters or those around them."
"""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" is an origin story that gets the late Tom Clancy's signature superspy right."
"""78/52"" delves far deeper into the shower scene analysis than anything I have seen or read before, and that is quite a bit."

"Another great feel-bad treat from Martin McDonagh, featuring one of Colin Farrell’s best performances yet as a guy trying (and failing) to deal with the fallout of a falling out."

"Some of the most disturbing material in ""Roll Red Roll"" comes via audio from a sports radio show."

"Air Doll works as an interesting, solid drama and character study while also addressing much bigger real-world themes and ideas, including loneliness and the roles of women in society. "

"Using a comic book as a template rather than merely a guide, Rodriguez and Miller have fused fantasy and noir to create a truly enveloping film-going experience."
The Love Jones comparisons aren't necessarily off as The Photograph probably deserves to be similarly appreciated without the cult classic label this time.
A film as necessary as it is harrowing... [Full review in Spanish]
The new creative team effectively taps into a quarter century of real-world affinity from fans for some clever meta commentary within the film.
"O'Reilly is terrific as the sneery discontent at the centre of the madcap maelstrom, while Rima Te Wiata walks a wonderfully fine line between pathos and aggravation as the long-suffering/insufferable mum whose forced smile is about to crack."
A remarkable study of obsessive filmmaking that ranks as one of the best movies of the year.
Entertainingly gritty until an ending that seems to go against all that has preceded it.
"Decent, but not consistently strong and -- at least in the case of our screening -- ruined by an obnoxious audience that didn't fully understand what sort of pic they were really seeing. (Full Content Parental Review also available)"
It does come off as a slightly watered-down Pan's Labyrinth - it steps towards the abyss of strangeness but never quite leaps off
"Nearly 20 years before the same themes powered Bonnie and Clyde, Lewis was on to the possibilities of ""outsider"" cinema, and his film is all the more subversive for its origins as raw pulp, unpoliced by the Hollywood system, and getting away with murder."
"With a spectacular mountain setting and a committed central performance, this film remains watchable even if it's underpowered."
"This emotionally wrenching drama is an actors' showcase, a primer on quick-and-dirty filmmaking that nonetheless looks beautiful, and a welcome-to-the-big-leagues party for Anne Hathaway."
An epic work. [Full review in Spanish]
Respect does have moments that truly transcend the limitations of its otherwise by-the-numbers approach and those are the moments where the music comes alive.
"The film doesn't ask to judge King so much as consider a broader portrait, bigger than the muck the FBI peddled, but maybe more complex and dimensional than what our marble statues also suggest. It makes him loom larger."
"Foxx gives one of the year's best performances, and early talk about an Oscar nomination is entirely justified."
"Powered almost entirely by Black's infectious charisma and eccentricity, School of Rock is raucous and heartwarming comedy."
Gets at something deeply unsettling about the human condition.
A thrilling character study but only an average action flick.
"They do get the right actresses for this, though. All three of these women contribute worthy reactions and riffs, though the straw that stirs this drink is Hahn, who is so underappreciated that it's no longer funny."
"So while, similar to the real-life human being it portrays, the movie ""Harriet"" might have its flaws, it is an important depiction for our time: at least as important as a future president's supposed chopping down of a cherry tree."
"This is a gloriously gonzo trip packed with enough odd narrative tangents to fill half a dozen features. While not always successful, this energetic mash-up so genuinely wants to entertain that it's hard not to be won over by its barrage of absurdity."
Goodfellas by way of Wild Strawberries...
"Jamie, Pritti, Hugo, Loco... These figures are designed to appeal to girls, boys and everyone in between. As such, they more than deserve to be the talk of the town."

"A fun, yet predictable, horror film with some pretty insane and bloody deaths."
The 'stars' definitely aligned to make this picture work.
This fifth movie is where fans who understand the intrinsic darkness of the series will stand up and be counted.

"Cuaron demonstrates his capacity as a director. The camera work is impressive, his sense of humor sharp, and the characters are well defined."
"""A Fantastic Woman"" is above all the story of a woman who loves, loses her love and fights for the universal human right to experience her loss and mourn for it, so that she will be able to get on with her life."

"Even if the movie is less real than it aspires to be, the connection between the two leads feels totally genuine."
"A master class in cinematic formalism, from a man with a lifetime of knowledge and experience."
"I LOVED it. An amazing cast of characters led flawlessly by Daniel Craig, Chris Evans and Ana de Armas. The moment I thought I knew what was happening, a twist threw me. One of my year's favorite films."
"It's as creepy as it needs to be, and not even remotely as creepy as its asinine R-rating would indicate, and it's pretty shallow beyond that."
"Wise beyond her years, [Nika, played by Bronislawa Zamachowska] has a curt, verging on antagonistic relationship with her old man, but she's a ray of light in an otherwise grave endeavour."
Extraordinarily vivid and fresh.
At least in Big Miracle people stop haranguing others across the aisle and start working together.

"A seriously good movie, a challenge to viewers, a rebuke of the way many Americans live their lives."
Even those who don't know a Marvel hero from a DC caped crusader will find themselves having a grand time. That's because Whedon manages to tap the inner fanboy and fangirl dormant in us all.
"One of Mr. Kapadia's most inspired strokes in this valuable documentary is to put her lyrics on screen as she sings them, so we can see for ourselves the essential elements of her songs as they reflected, and intertwined with, her tumultuous life."
What can be said about Concussion outside that it's Will Smith's best performance in years? Too bad it's for a movie mostly plays it safe and isn't as thrilling or biting as it aspires to be.
What a treat it is to discover a totally new actor inside one we already loved. And how sad to know we won't see that from him again.

"A personal film for John Huston, starring daughter Anjelica and adapted to the screen by son Tony, this very last work evokes beautifully the mood and texture of James Joyce's lyrical story."
"There's something achingly liminal about (Lee's) cinema, where the emotions exist in the in-between spaces along society's edges, between words and glances, never fully expressed in words but keenly felt just the same."
"...starts out well enough, with its quirky directorial touches and even quirkier storyline, but finally becomes just too overwhelming."
"Judy dazzles during its musical numbers... [and] Zellweger throws herself into the title role and transcends playing Garland, never falling into camp, or mimicking the singer. She also captures Garland's mannerisms without making them seem fake."
"As in Field's first film, the characters are drawn with such compassion their follies become our own and their desires seem as vast as the night sky."
"A fairly average entry into the genre elevated to ""must-see"" status because of a hilarious extended cameo...and an original song that is my current vote for Best Song of 2019."
Represents big budget filmmaking at its finest and long-form storytelling at its most emotionally rewarding.
"By his own admission, Hytner is not a film stylist who can ""think with a camera,"" but he handles Bennett's tales with crisp economy."
"Winterbottom captures the atmosphere of a dusty community where everyone knows everybody's history, and where money and power can only sway public opinion to a point."
"A gently amusing, rural comedy of manners."
"If the build-up inevitably shares Juliette's coldness, the conclusion is rich with emotion, raising questions about psychology, morality and more - even if it doesn't wholly convince."
"A sensitive and beautiful film - one that contains genuine insight into the power of human connection, be it romantic, sexual, or some combination of both."
"A giddy, gory, beautifully mounted trash spectacle ... at least so far."
"Unapologetically harsh and heedlessly entertaining despite its imperfections, the film includes two masterful performances from Crowe and Bale - actors so intense, they could wear red and intimidate a charging bull."
Salma Hayek gives the performance of her career in this stealth weapon of a comedy from director Miguel Arteta and screenwriter Mike White.
"Zack Snyder's epic adaptation gives this generation a Superman movie to call its own. Call it ""Superman Begins""."
"The silliest spin-off this side of Elektra, and lots of fun with it."
"Despite its formulaic structure, The Abandoned has a lot going for it. It eschews cheap scares, bloodletting, and gore."
"Moore still hasn't learned some basic rhetorical skills: Will he ever figure out that acknowledging contrary views gives your argument more credibility? But his movie is shocking, poignant and surprisingly entertaining."
"As it is, I admire the brilliance of the majority of this picture to no-end; it's just that pesky literal ending I walked out wanting to declare war on."
"Perhaps the best compliment I can afford is this: A Death In The Gunj is a film that Konkona, the actor, would have chosen in a heartbeat."
"Flee is an effective and striking story told in a uniquely cinematic way.

"
Simon Pegg is almost brilliant with his slapstick comedy and dedication to goofiness.

"If you loved the show, you'll likely love the movie; if you detest the show, you'll hate the movie. Personally, I fall closer to the middle."
...a bewildering extension rather than a retread of this played-out subgenre.
"The camera stays on Bannon, and what we see is a man who reveals himself even as he thinks he's gaining the upper hand."
"The film, shot on natural locations in Norway, benefits enormously from the breathtaking beauty of the country, and it looks like a much bigger-budget film than it is."
"It becomes a mesmerising personal vision thanks to Vigo's sophisticated blend of fairy-tale romance, documentary realism, surrealist fantasy, bawdy humour and working-class song."
"A $130 million epic with much to marvel at and great battle scenes, but it dazzles the senses while barely touching the heart."
Pleasure elicits a taunt and razor-sharp depiction of adult film&apos;s dysfunctional climate&#46; 
"The best Ashley Judd movie Judd has never made... a labyrinthine serial killer thriller that won't win admirers for its intellect, but does have sustenance of mood in spades."
"Hanks is being given an awards season push here, no surprise, though he's bound to be hindered by the fact that he makes it all look so easy."
"It's more like an interesting, in-depth article in The New Yorker than a movie."
"Fegley and his character miss it for me because of an innate selfishness in motivation, plus overall meanness to the story's pranks."
A formulaic yet fun adventure.
"Audiences ready, willing and able to find their inner four-year-old may have a decent time at 'Daddy Day Care,' but others are likely to find Eddie Murphy's latest foray into kidpicdom scarcely more amusing than spending 90 minutes in a pre-K classroom."
[T]reat[s] the charming nonsense of food falling from the sky like weather with exactly the sort of bouyant nimbleness it deserves...
"An intense, headily sensual epic with a sometimes overcooked feel and oodles of Euro-artiness."
"Onward might not quite hit the zenith of the gargantuan Pixar mountain, but it's just one more burst of gas away from that sky-high summit."
"Throughout, Judd Apatow dramatizes the ideal of community with an almost Eastwoodian sense of rapture."
The Forgiven takes a while to grab hold&#44; overcoming its awkward and meandering beginning to settle into being a powerful slow burn of a morality tale&#44; delivered with a memorable performance by one of the great actors of our time&#46;
This is heady stuff - a more natural fit for a black-and-white Bergman than a kiddie caper.
"In a year that's seen mainstream cinema struggle to reach any great heights, it's refreshing to find a film that's as engaging and defiantly hard-to-pin down as Elle."
It's a marvelous film. [Full review in Spanish]
"Breathtakingly beautiful, truly magical movie."
"Assayas uses the supernatural to explore grief, and Stewart portrays Maureen's heartbreaking loneliness with skill. She completely carries the film."
"McDonagh explores this village of secrets with tremendous care and craftiness, and provides Gleeson with another stellar opportunity to deliver striking work."
"For people won't have seen the original ""Oldboy"" or anything remotely like it, this will be a rare studio release that feels shocking and abrasive and perverse and in some way new."
"The film actually improves on Cunningham's novel, thanks to gorgeous cinematography, a deft script by playwright David Hare ... a mournful, melodious but never intrusive score by Philip Glass and a superb cast."
"A quietly moving piece of Irish cinema, The Quiet Girl doesn’t wear its heart on its sleeve, but it sure as hell has one."
"There are some impressive special effects, but the picture is more a charming character study than a futuristic adventure."
"The director manages to sustain the film's quirky emotional tone, much more important than sustaining a plot."
Atmospheric and bewitching.
"As bawdy, self-conscious, jaded and still sweetly optimistic as its double-entendre of a title suggests."
What sets Thelma & Louise aside from the great central tradition of the road picture is that the heroes are women this time.
"The best part of ""Thor: The Dark World"" was watching Jeanne almost falling off her seat when the handsome Hemsworth doffs his top to reveal an amazingly chiseled physique."
"Deeply frightening, telling a story that could bore into your kids' nightmares if you're not careful."
"It's quite a movie -- atmospheric, obsessive, almost satanic."
One doesn't leave the movie with a mind blown by visual bedazzlement but with a soul shattered by the profound sense of tragedy Linklater and company so beautifully put across.
The connection between Rudy Ray Moore and Eddie Murphy - both in a fictional and real world perspective - is what makes this a rewarding viewing experience.
"It's the blurring of boundaries that makes Wildcat more than just an excruciating series of intensifying scenes of torture, disorienting for the audience as well as the characters."
Danny Boyle's purposeful direction and Mark Tildesley's imaginative and resourceful production design keep this fresh and edgy; the images of a wasted London and the details of a paramilitary organization in the countryside are both creepy and persuasive.
"It wasn't the automatic laughter produced by slam-dunk punch lines, but the laughter of recognition, of insight, even sometimes of squirmy discomfort, as the truths hit close to home."
"Of course it's no ""Chinatown,"" but it is satisfyingly moody and atmospheric."
[H]umanity is what Thor has in spades.
"The majority of the gags, as crude as they can be, hit the mark and the interplay between Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly keeps the film from becoming a repetitive bore."
"Apart from an unnecessary profusion of subplots, you'll likely find this heist-thriller to be quite satisfying."
Mel Brooks was THE comic master of the 70's
Offers much enjoyment.
"This intimate three-hour epic unfolds in graphic detail, sexual and emotional; it goes where mainstream cinema has not gone before."
The moment when Tilda tastes the prawns prepared for her by the studly bearded soulful chef guy is a deliriously high art moment of food equalling sex.
"Delicate, warm and worried, ""Felix and Meira"" is a coming-of-age film about two grown people stunted by social circumstance."

"Hackers isn't a very good movie, but it's a darn sight more fun than The Net."
"An uplifting spiritual drama about the value of wonder, the trouble with answers, the constrictions of fear, and the liberation of sharing and caring for others."
"Through it all - action set-pieces, eco-subplots, a few frights - Favreau drives the plot like a man with a machete, clearing the way for us to be swept along, dazzled, delighted."
"In different hands, Snowpiercer might have been just another generic action movie. Yet with South Korean director Bong Joon-ho at the helm, it's instead something more off-kilter and more disturbingly satisfying."
"Rare is the social satire that rings as true as Network does, and the film is even more topical today than it was thirty years ago."
"If you know any teenage boys with anger issues or a tendency to get into trouble, this movie definitely speaks their language."
"This is a movie about losing one's grip and like any addict's story, it's boring, ugly, sad, and terribly human. And surprisingly funny."
"While ""Kong: Skull Island"" is visual eye candy, its sophistication and excellence negate the fairy tale-magical quality that endeared the original to generations of filmgoers."
"A satisfying and prickly low-key hum of discontent and moral exploration. In Muntean's exhausted landscape, the world wont listen even when its stuck in frozen mud."
"You don't have to be a Star Trek fan to enjoy this rollicking movie. J.J. Abrams' reboot of the 1966 TV space adventure series is fast-paced, action-packed and lots of fun."
"Harold Ramis's direction is nothing special, yet there is a beautiful, lip-smacking efficiency in the way that a great idea is touched off and followed to its conclusion."
"Puppet-master technique and a generally well orchestrated sense of moodiness help this chiller deliver on more than it botches, despite a fumbled third act."
"On display in Poster is the full panoply of pop music's glorious, ego-warped idiocy, from the demented bubble of an entourage to pseudo poses of humility by the famous."
"""You could say that the film is not about anything but, really, it's about everything""."
(Seabiscuit) is a mixed feedbag of hackneyed cliche and inspired drama. In a curious way it has a pace and momentum not unlike a racehorse. It is a slow starter with a pecular gait that rapidly builds up speed and finishes a winner by a nose at the wire.
"They've cranked it up another couple notches for Crank: High Voltage, with mixed results."
[Crowe's] work here is indeed a thing of beauty.
"Suicide is no laughing matter, but there are some wry smiles in this changeably moody indie-pic about self-destructive siblings."
"[I]f you tingle at the sound of metal unsheathing and the sight of flaming arrows whizzing through moonlight, you'll probably be swept away by this shining Knight in amour."
Imagine Austin Powers running into Zoolander at a Black Panthers meeting...
"Without Molina and Lithgow, the film might feel like little more than a light experiment in social dynamics. But nearly everything about ""Love Is Strange"" suits it ..."
I&apos;m Thinking of Ending Things is one of the best films of 2020&#46;
Phillips directs a pretty entertaining film that is commanded by Phoenix's performance. His commitment to the role is Joker's most compelling aspect and he makes it his own through his physicality and delivery.
"Ritchie has essentially made the same movie over again, only this time with even more energy, panache, style and pit bulls."
"A fierce, stark, haunted drama of horror narrowly avoided."
Entertaining albeit lightweight.
The best movie heroine in years&#46;

"The competition sequences on the golf links, with the splendid camera work of Michael Ballhaus, and exactly the right amount of digital tweaking, are the real revelations of this film."
"It deals subtly but frankly with three of the most annoyingly painful human experiences: fighting with siblings, adolescent moodiness, and stepping on LEGOs in bare feet."
Joseph Gordon-Levitt is shaping up to be the real deal.
"The world needs this movie, and whether you're a fan of deeply personal stories of triumph, or just the Springsteen discography, you'll be absolutely stunned by what this film has to offer."
"Justin McConnell is compelling in his honesty and so obviously in love with his subject. It's a beautiful work about all the hard work that goes on behind the scenes. For film lovers, industry insiders, and hopeful dreamers alike ..."
"""Knives Out"" is as much a 'toon as it is a hat tip to the elaborate mechanics of an Agatha Christie mystery. It's silly and suspenseful in equal measure."
For all its flaws&#44; Elvis remains a remarkably entertaining experience&#44; the credit for which rests largely with its star&#46; Butler is the strongest element film&#44; and the energy with which he infuses the musical numbers is undeniably electrifying&#46;
A bittersweet comedy-drama that manages to be hilarious in one scene and extremely touching in the next.
"A remarkable, heartfelt and hilarious journey that will leave you homesick with recognition."
"An enlightening script, expert ensemble acting and the most revealing film ever made about a young woman's right to choose."
"While the action interludes are impressively staged and edited, they strain for originality..."
Jurassic World&#58; Dominion has a terrible script but achieves thrilling&#44; CGI-fueled action&#46; My issues are mitigated by pure entertainment value&#46; Who doesn&apos;t enjoy watching a Pterosaur rip a plane out of the sky&#63;
A captivating blend of razor sharp and perceptive wit and nail biting suspense.
"For its story moment before the gathering storm broke, this film is a garden wall held up, a finger in the dyke, just before the deluge and fall into darkness."
"By no means a masterpiece of the genre, but it's a slickly made picture that more than delivers on the promise made on its poster--oh yes, there will be blood."
"[Notturno is a] film that does not seek to document war atrocities but rather to observe their aftermath, it is an earnest look at those who have been left behind, those whose hearts are bleeding even if they seem to have healed."
"What makes Match Point, a coolly deliberate murder mystery from Woody Allen, so startling is that it feels as if the director himself has been done away with."
"A well-felt celebration of romantic, emotional and physical maturity, filled with laughs and tears. It's also something of a revelation when it comes to Diane Keaton's range."
"Frequency submits itself for our approval as a solid thriller, if not necessarily a timeless one."
Gbravica is a womanly movie in the best sense: [writer-director] Zbanic has a deeply feminine sense of how crisis gets filtered through the moments of daily life.
"Black Hawk Down, boasting the most authentic depiction of contemporary warfare ever filmed, belongs in a time capsule. It's a classic."
"Not as good as it thinks, but powerful filmmaking all the same"
"This is must-see mafia viewing. I would have said this is the best gangster film to come in a long time, but The Irishman beat Mafia Inc. to the punch."
One of the finest acted thrillers ever produced.
"A tragic, soul-crushing experience that - even if admired by viewers - will likely never be revisited again."
"funny and at times wonderfully weird, and even has a few meaningful things to say"
El-Masry transforming Omar's calm dignity into unshoulderable doubt is one of 2021&#8242;s best performances thus far.
Stewart's filmmaking debut showcases his sardonic sense of humor within a story of courage and corruption amid contemporary political conflict.
Discerning travellers and Wes Anderson fans will luxuriate in the glorious Mittel-European kitsch of one of the director's funniest and most exquisitely designed movies in years.
A fascinating and artistically animated movie that's worth seeing more than once.
A powerfully compelling film that gains most of its intrigue via the artifice of purposefully withholding information from the moviegoer.
Exults in its own giddy absurdity.
Welcome To New York will madden many but delight the Big Apple auteur's admirers.
"Jordan always had 6-foot-4 Liam Neeson in mind to play the man they called ""the Big Fellow,"" and it's more than size that makes Neeson fit the part of a leader known for his ""cloudburst temperament."""
"The dialogue is riddled with moody, witty cursing and unequalled wordplay - and all sorts of sarcastic nonsense."
"Solid period piece with good dialogue. Standard relationship stuff, but well done."
&#91;Strickland&#8217;s&#93; films are often creepy if not downright horrific yet can also be perversely funny&#44; both the case with his latest&#44; a film that&#8217;s had me breaking out in giggles for the last 24 hours&#46;
"It's a consistent joy, but it's also unfocused, showcasing Allen's tendency to get lost in unnecessary subplots."
"It seems ageless, despite being set in 2019. This is a future more murky than shining, where hardened men move among the lowlife in a warren of streets lit like an Edward Hopper painting, below pyramid-like skyscrapers."
"Love The Coopers is the perfect gift for the entire family, and that's certainly not a bad thing these days."
Although I would 't say that this is [Wes Anderson's] most successful film... the filmmaker's ability to infect us with that historical moment that none of us lived through is remarkable. [Full review in Spanish]
"The Maels are inherently fascinating subjects either way; the cool, inscrutable centre to Wright's giddy panegyric."
"Wan ... builds the many bumps in the night into a small Hitchcockian symphony of terror by way of long, eerie tracking shots, dramatic silences, and sudden scares that are frighteningly immersive."
"While there's nothing wrong with looking back on 30-year-old Spielberg flicks, or 60-year-old sci-fi B-movies with rosy adoration, doing so to the point of subverting Abrams' own artistic voice mars what might have been great instead of just good."
"He's back! Let the bells ring out, let the choirs of angels sing! Tom Cruise has once again, to the surprise of many, given a great performance."
Mixes fact and fiction to provide a look at Van Gogh&apos;s tortured mental state during his final years&#46;
Avengers: Endgame is not just a remarkable movie; it's an unforgettable experience.
There are not a lot of movies that can hold your interest when virtually the entire story takes place in a confined area. But that is exactly what 7500 accomplishes.
It is the craziest movie you will see all year but it sure held my attention.
"""Quest"" could very easily have been titled ""An American Family"" as well."
"The summer's most exciting thriller is also its timeliest. Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin turn this 'Sicario' into a film every bit on the level of the great first film, and in many ways even exceeds it."
Fences has sharp dialogue and excellent performances but it's shot like a play not a movie.
"The animation, a gorgeous blend of bewitching watercolored backgrounds and poignantly rendered characters, is, as ever, beyond reproach."
"Proyas, an assured stylist, manages to elevate the film with a bright palette and an abundance of special effects."
Lamb could be ridiculous... Crucial to preventing this from happening is Rapace's immersion in a character that would seem impossible to perform with conviction and honesty. [Full review in Spanish]
"""Into the Storm"" runs a brisk 89 minutes, and for every second of its running time finds ways to make tornadoes interesting."
"Though the film starts off as a cliché-ridden redemption story, it gets more interesting as Smith quietly drifts into the background and his subjects' lives come into narrative focus."
Superbly acted from top to bottom.
"Yes, they throw more than rice at this Wedding, but it's all in service of an astutely observed and sometimes shattering human drama."
If you're looking to find out how to make an action/spy thriller more than just an action spy thriller then look no further then Hanna.
"In the end, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is just what it promised to be. [Full review in Spanish]"
Anurag Kashyap riffs on a grisly episode of Mumbai history in his luridly absorbing serial killer thriller.
"""If you're gonna tell it, tell it right!""... It could ultimately be the motto for the entire film... but is really concerned with telling uncomfortable truths about 20th-century American social history."
It has many moving moments and some fine acting.
"A tongue in cheek look at Roger Corman's legacy, it's every bit as fun as you'd expect given Corman's oeuvre."
[a] whimsically solid entry. Cuaron creates a Harry Potter universe that is visually more stunning and sardonic in content...a viably entertaining creepy coming-of-age saga

You could make a worse choice at your local multiplex this weekend.
 &#8220;Your Place or Mine&#8221; isn&#8217;t thrilling&#44; but it&#8217;s easily digestible with capable performances from Witherspoon and Kutcher&#44; who have the advantage of not sharing many scenes&#46;

"The only difference is that three of the five have a learning disability - but in this documentary, which is very funny in places, it's not disabilities that define them."

"For this and this alone Mallick should be applauded. His epic of an old world giving up and a new one taking over isn't a masterpiece. But it is different, daring to look at complex historical issues with intelligence and an unwaveringly piercing eye."
"Lynch's elliptical story-telling mode lends the film a hypnotic quality, his measured voiceover complemented by a liberal use of slow-motion."

It's an intriguing experience.
"The film's effect is so powerful, its timeless themes so beautifully dramatized: War is hell and senseless but inevitable; love is what binds us together and rips us apart; life is a series of accidents-both awful and joyous-waiting to happen."
"The film does shed light an another facet of Nazi history, and it does it with an attention to the complexity of human nature that makes it worthy of its Oscar win."
"Quite possibly [Spielberg's] darkest, coldest, most socially pertinent, subversive, and reactionary film to date."
"A modern-day heist thriller of unusually grim, coiled intensity ..."
"What emerges is less than an in-depth portrait of a man -- we learn little about him, aside from his intelligence, his charisma and his itch to be near power -- than a study of nationhood, history and the psychology of heroism."
...some genuinely hilarious set ups and a nice mixture of farce and other styles of comedy.
Each of the stories in Personal Velocity leaves the viewer wanting even more.
The film has one of those whip-smart screenplays that avoids just about every story-telling pitfall you can imagine spinning out of this premise.

"Occasionally loses its focus and drags, but it nonetheless remains compelling, provocative and, for the most part, emotionally resonating thanks to raw performances and a delicately woven, character-driven screenplay."
"It's a film for 2012, for the 99 per cent, for the Occupiers who have been criticised as Starbucks-quaffing smartphone revolutionaries seeking a rainbow connection that could only be called 'kermunism'."
"Bolstered by strong performances and immersive production design, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is an introspective and rewarding film from Tarantino."
"No matter what side you end up taking, you still might be tempted to call your lawyer to go over your will just one more time."
A giddy sugar-rush that slows to reveal its big charms.
"Branagh's remembrances may be idealized, but with ""Belfast"" he has written a charming, rose-tinted thank-you note to the city that sparked his dreams and the parents whose sacrifices helped them come true."
Creative Cold War Bond thriller is best for teens and up.
A cut above some of the other recent spate of Middle East-set thrillers.
"Love! Assistants! Wordplay! This film has it all-at least by the standards of a fun, disposable romantic comedy, the likes of which Hollywood rarely bothers to release anymore."
It all makes for a lean and spritely if ephemeral Minions fix.
Cooper perfectly captures the chilly terrain of the Hudson Highlands and fills the twisting story with a gothic atmosphere befitting the poet who walks within the pages&#46;
Cartel Land is a brilliantly exposed snapshot of a hugely complicated situation.
"The kind of movie whose dialogue mostly hews to the rhythms of 'like, you know, whatever' but then occasionally throws in a word such as 'puissance.' And, like, it totally works."
The animation throughout is either adorable or breathtaking.
"There's something about the cumulative effect of repeated swearing, accompanied by Thornton and Cox's delivery that turns it into comedy gold."
"It won the Audience Award at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, but don't let that be a source of dissuasion. It's actually a pretty good movie."
"The aesthetic choices and percussive pervasiveness in the score help represent Damien, the man, the podcaster and philophobic. This project is clearly a labour of love and I'm looking forward to Tyler Cole's next production."
Mix of celebrity worship and unflinching biography&#46; Well put together character study with some participants that seem intent on keeping people at arm&#8217;s length&#46; The end result is a comprehensive look that is equal parts interesting and frustrating&#46;&#10;&#10;
"At a dim time for cinema, it can rejuvenate your faith in American movies."
"It's never less than watchable, a bizarre hybrid that somehow works as a whole, even though its various components don't mesh."
"Gimmicky drive-in fare, though nobody can deliver that poem like Price."
It's [in] the intimate moments ... when And Then We Danced is at its best; full of sensuality and endless possibilities.
"Its discussion of passion and obsession, regret and reconciliation is consistently challenging and offers few easy answers."
It makes a thousand points well without any made didactically; it is simultaneously one of the angriest films I've seen this year while also being one of the quietest.
"Innovative illustration, sharp scripting and vibrant vocalising gives this sprightly animated comedy a knack for melting down the frostiest resistance."
"Leonardo DiCaprio is a nuclear bomb as Belfort, the actor basking in the ridiculousness of his surroundings and eclipsing them at every turn."
"Whether the wit fizzes or flops, a Marvel movie will always live or die by its action set-pieces. And in this latest adventure, they are truly spectacular..."
"It's cheeky and confident, maybe one of the director's finest, and its loopy final line is the cryptic cherry on this oddball gâteau."
"This is probably Rob Zombie's best film, though it does often prove that the cinephile writer/director is a gifted tyro. At the same time, as his most formally mannered and tonally tempered film, Zombie's latest also proves his versatility."
"This is an old-school independent film that won't make a zillion bucks or win major awards, but it's refreshingly honest, depicts the kinds of American lives not often seen on-screen and shows us a familiar star in a striking new light."
The whole film sizzles with urban aggression.
"The impression all of these clips in toto is of a life fully lived, of an artist who has seen much in her life and wants to share all she has learned with the rest of the world. But Cameraperson adds up to so much more than just a personal remembrance."
It's not hard to figure out why this movie has triumphed at film festivals.
"Östlund has an exquisite eye for the intimate, nonverbal communication between couples through their posture, gestures, their eyes."
The movie that is staggered by real life tragedy but refuses to be felled; it blurs the line between the world of the characters and the real world in a way that is so effective and affecting that the finale packs a humongous emotional punch.
"It should be essential viewing, particularly in high schools and universities, whence the next generation of policy makers will one day emerge, hopefully more enlightened than we have been."
This is a comedy that recognizes that the wounds inflicted during adolescence run deep and never fully heal.
"It sounds like a depressing little framework, but the actors give it life."
"Don't make your family pay for a death notice in the New York Times. ""Obit"" will inspire you to do something great, which means the paper of record will grant you a free placement."
The movie unfolds in a satisfying slow-burn that makes you feel uneasy until it takes that anxiety and turns it into pure nightmare fuel by making your worst fears real.
"A gorgeously shot, deeply interior portrait of the artist as a young introvert."
"KILL YOUR DARLINGS is really smart, but the movie never feels overly academic. It's too fun and frenzied, beautifully paced."
"Parallels to 9/11, John Ashcroft, the Patriot Act and the rest of the Bush administration's racist thuggery are obvious; the movie creates a stirring tide of activist force."
"No, these things don't all blend together well, but if you can follow Moana's island society's lead and just roll with it, you'll enjoy them one by one."
"In many ways it's a minor film, but it has some insight ..."
A not so bad bromance.
"It's an adulatory recording of the band - that's right, he adores them - but it's much more than that."
"There is something undeniably exhilarating about the film's honest assessment of the never-ending conflict between decency and cruelty that rages in every nation, neighborhood and heart."
"Producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson should be applauded for taking so many bold risks. The gosmacking ending, in fact, may be the biggest in Bond history."
"When a film covers familiar ground, as this coming-of-age story does, it had better offer an original point of view or, at the very least, interesting characters. The Art of Getting By has both, and while it loses its footing now and then, its..."
"Davis' tough, man-of-the-people narration is often annoying, but his words can't diminish the power of his story."
Shin isn't shy about laying on quirky details and oddball splashes to make his third film swing from bizarrely entertaining to dark - though the mystery-solved conclusion feels rushed and is the weakest part of the film.
"Although directed in a pop-smart style that eschews dark, deterministic melodramatics for an unsettlingly sunny tone ... the film also frustrates for having come so close to being something truly challenging."
"Washington directed as well as starred, and it is clear he has no trouble wearing both hats at once"
Burski eloquently conveys the impeccable &#40;but unpredictable&#41; alchemy of the production by underscoring&#44; with frequency&#44; how much of its brilliance was an accidental confluence&#44; how its specific magic was the right combination of people&#44; events&#44; and timing
"With talk about a sequel, it's the perfect time to return to this action-comedy..."
"This story is told with sincerity, heart, and a little bit of magic -- the very same qualities that made the original book a ""you have to read this"" classic for young girls."
The documentary is&#44; like Little Richard himself&#44; colorful&#44; humorous&#44; and wildly entertaining&#46; 
Here is a dark comedy from the great Bong Joon-Ho about class warfare that&#44; depending on your mood&#44; you may find to be a work of genius or too self-indulgent&#46; One thing is certain&#44; you&#8217;ve never seen anything quite like it&#46;

George Romero set a new standard for horror with this low-budget opus.

"A precise proposal that knows how to get the most out of a story with no much news in the plot, but painful and fascinating. [Full review in Spanish]"

"Comical, colorful, wonderfully cast and beautifully animated, ""Rio"" is the first Blue Sky movie that could be compared to the best of Pixar."

An outrageously gorgeous spectacle of balletic aggression.
"There's less than meets the eye to Joachim Trier's Reprise, but the loose, limber visual style gives the picture a certain panache."
The picture is potent and engaging; even its fictionalized elements ring with the spirit of truth.
"Whether or not there is story plausibility here, there is an emotional integrity to every reaction Maisie has to every development."
"If this is the level of arcane mischief Janiak has in store for 1978 and 1666 soon after, then consider this watcher bewitched."
"""13 Minutes"" is a superbly acted and strikingly evocative work, with careful attention to period detail and its many emotional beats."
It is still a solid - and ultimately entertaining - new spin on the beloved tale.
"...an immersive experience, aided by the absence of narration, and Ed Cortes' eclectic soundtrack is the perfect complement to the individualistic characters featured."
"What Le petit soldat, like all Godard's great films, lacks in traditional narrative or aesthetic form it more than regains in its immediacy of thought."
"But eventually, the world has to start moving again. It always does. That's what the movie is about."
Henry Selick’s first movie since 2009’s Coraline. His fifth stop-motion masterpiece.
"Creed II does not give us anything but another, slightly superior Rocky sequel. It wins on points. Just don't expect a knockout."
"I know what you're thinking, but this is no Limitless (Bradley Cooper). As the cells multiply and Lucy taps into more and more of her brain, it's new thrills-new skills with each passing hour."
"Director Fernando Meirelles tells the story with urgency, and his sharp visual compositions and washed out cinematography ooze gangster life."
"""Kajillionaire"" is a rich piece of storytelling, and it feels like a kajillion bucks."
A heartfelt story with a lovely performance from Scott Chambers.
If a bit long for a cartoon feature -- probably a sign that its makers fell in love with it -- Ratatouille is the eighth and one of the best Pixar features.
"Anchored by a charming performance from Greta Gerwig, it's as light and breezy as a walk in Central Park, and just as refreshing."
"It's largely a Hanks solo show, and the beloved icon is in fine, unfussy form."
"It is not one of those family films that will delight both children and adults alike. However, the kids will find it to be entertaining enough."
"The Amazing Johnathan Documentary is ingeniously constructed, a hilarious thrill ride and the underdog story of the year."
A little more conflict and less beatification would have made for a more insightful film.
"16 Assassins is reliably entertaining, but ultimately it's too traditional to be a classic."
The brown-bag movie of the year: Sneak in a bottle of something bitter and cheap (to match the central characters) and get smashed along with the onscreen relationship.
The quirky script is packed with good lines and off-the-wall moments and the stories are surprisingly moving in places.
"It is a model of dignified, delicate restraint but there are times when it seems to suffocate under the weight of its own sumptuous respectability."
The picture fires on all pistons.
I highly recommend you check this out on the big screen.
"Oh it's fun. An old-fashioned, good-hearted action film with a sense of humor."
"Despite its downbeat theme, A Single Man is ultimately optimistic about the human capability to gradually make peace with seemingly insurmountable pain and tragedy."
"Hersh's intelligent style turns a dialogue-heavy, potentially rote film into an enthralling and moving experience."
"It's too bad the movie never quite sweeps us up - it's slow in spots, and there's an awful lot of exposition."
What could easily have become its own figurative image of the masculine longing for freedom mines far deeper concerns.
"Mank isn’t about the incredibly tedious question of who wrote Citizen Kane —that’s the hook, but the film’s true interest, to my immense relief, is the incredibly specific story of Upton Sinclair’s failed 1934 California gubernatorial bid."
A sterling supporting cast -- down to the tiniest bit parts -- provides enough astringent intelligence to make the slobbering sentimentality go down with ease.
Enthusiastically acted and sharply written. A big old lovefest in honor of the classic alien visitation movies that we all hold near and dear.
"The Assistant is a must see, not just because it relates to the behaviour of everyone within the workplace, but because it does so without the need to preach."
It's hard to see how anyone wouldn't be absorbed by this fascinating film about a formidable driver and man.
"The Hate U Give features a strong and incredibly moving performance from Amandla Stenberg, who never holds anything back from the audience and never overplays a moment. She's a star in the making."
The film feels equally drawn out despite the bursts of black humour and the emotional depth of Fan's performance.
"We'd like to take the whole film home, to keep it and cherish its dark wit and intensity."
A seriously quirky piece of work...
An eye-opener that focuses on world-shaking events and makes you feel like you are there.
"Reenactments in documentaries are always a tricky business, but here, they feel necessary. The staged scenes communicate just how visceral mountaineering can be."
"Here, merriment and melancholy go hand in hand, partners in life's dance just as a stiff drink is an accompaniment to life's pleasures. The combination proves as intoxicating as the fancy-pants cocktails the boys whip up together."
"Even though we know the outcome...the campaign progress remains enthralling. Mostly because it's a fascinating snapshot of modern politics in flux...and a hopeful, ultimately moving account of idealism in action."
"The brothers Coen deliver a taut, vastly entertaining dissertation on the imbalance of life."
"Time to Leave blows a fresh, skeptical wind through fairly corny melodramatic territory while keeping faith with the operatic emotions of the genre."
Mild sedative filled with a good run of giggles and the frightening aim of the A-list cast. Nancy Meyers would be wise to keep corralling this type of acting pedigree. It makes her merlot-stained screenplays more palatable than they have any right to be.
A film worth seeing.
"It's a warm, if pallid, romantic comedy that may not do much more to burnish Lopez's reputation, but will certainly not bruise it."
It'll keep the kids entertained for a while and give their parents a chuckle or two along the way.
"It's a worthwhile showcase for Pacino, whose thoughtful portrayal of a washed-up stage actor is both contemplative and darkly comical."
"A stylish, frisky film that sets up the franchise deftly"
"It's a prettified view of love, for sure, but as Sox fans would surely attest, sometimes fairy tale dreams do come true."
"Beast is a strikingly shot, cleverly scripted, unsettling study of troubled psychology in the pressure-cooker claustrophobia of a small island."
"Highly recommended. In a world where the Best Animated Feature Oscar were not basically owned by Disney and Dreamworks, it would be a deserving champion."
"Inside Out's brainy script is matched both by its visual splendor, often invoking the spirit of Miyazaki, and its humanist reach, which extends to both family and (imaginary) friend alike."
"It is not a light movie (as the trailers might suggest), but it's a unique, refreshing one, driven by remarkable performances from Shawkat and Costa."
Remember the name Shohreh Aghdashloo ... she is the soul of this pungent film.
"This is a gorgeous, sweeping entertainment that combines the epic - a rain-whipped ascent through muddy hills is particularly awe-inspiring - with the intimate and the offbeat."
"A feminist chant that's necessary and relevant, a film about female empowerment and their roles in society, the work place and as human beings. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Even when the movie loses its way narratively, Washington's in there, slugging, building a living, breathing character out of Gilroy's knight-errant."
Bong Joon Ho dazzles your senses and infects your mind with a delicious concoction of artful entertainment that delivers a poignant cinematic experience. [Full review in Spanish]
"""American Sniper"" is crammed with action, heart-pounding moments and incredible gunshots by Cooper. But Eastwood seems distracted by his need to make a patriotic film more than a desire to show the real ramifications of so much killing."
"Given it could be re-titled 'Microaggressions: The Movie', this is an unsurprisingly upsetting watch at times, but it's made compelling by Vega's dignified, heartfelt performance."
"The drinks and their consumption look mighty glamorous in ""Hey Bartender,"" Douglas Tirola's tidy and ingratiating documentary ode to high-end mixologists."
"In its own, weird way it resonates, even after a story that some will see as silly and an ending that teeters on gimmicky."
"Pledge is (sometimes frustratingly) ambiguous ... I have to give it credit, though. It's a scrappy little thriller that kept me entertained and enthralled the entire time."
A travelogue with teeth.
"""Don't Look Up"" is no ""Dr. Strangelove"" in achieving lasting political satire brilliance, but it does mirror the times in which it was produced."
"Clarke's specialties are anger and violence, and he captures them with a brutal precision that belies the inherent messiness of the action."
Phil is not a challenging film but it is funny and often sweet.
"""No Time to Die"" is a terrific movie: an up-to-the-minute, down-to-the-wire James Bond thriller with a satisfying neo-classical edge."
... Guédiguian punctures a lot of myths about the face-and the motives-of the French resistance.
"A fascinating, surprisingly funny and extremely moving new documentary about the Apollo space program that really does have the right stuff."
"The Naked Gun is still very funny more than 20 years later. Leslie Nielsen is awesome, and the gags are more hit than miss."
An emotional film that connects with the audience and resembles those epic films full of sentimentalism. [Full review in Spanish]
"Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly."
"Jennifer Garner, in her first romantic comedy, sparkles in this must-see date film."
Tends to get bogged down in an over-abundance of characters and plot developments but does produce enough twists that you never feel cheated by the outcome.
It's almost immediately immersive to be here again... even if it ultimately feels like three quarters of a very good movie chopped off from a whole.
"Set in a place where the American Dream has been dead for so long that no one even thinks to question its loss, the picture features terrific performances from its game cast."
"An appealing comedy with an unabashed streak of melodrama, sharp dialogue, and a superb ensemble cast, anchored by a lead performance by Al Pacino in lovable scamp mode."
... extremely entertaining. [Full review in Spanish]
"In certain circles, it won't be for anyone. But it's as unusual and enigmatic a piece of cinema as you're likely to see this year."
"It's about a boy and his dog, and also about firefighters, and so I don't see how it's possible not to have warm feelings toward it."
"In most years, Naomi Watts would be a shoo-in for an Oscar nomination with a performance that is absolutely mesmerizing and emotionally devastating."
"A morbid, awkward, raucously funny critique of modern life."
As Leopold ... Jackman is the perfect mix of rogue and gentleman.
"A carefully constructed ride of anxiety, in which characters suffer under the voyeuristic eye of the audience and of society as a whole."
"Whatever your take on Showgirls going in, McHale's film will add new layers to it, and make you want to re-watch this fabulously bizarre flop-turned-classic with more questioning eyes."
"An ""edge"" of your seat thriller, perfect for cinephiles who find these moments of our past scintillating."
"It is such a cute movie. It's so adorable, so funny, so sweet. It's corny, but not overwhelmingly corny. It so works."
"Beautifully executed, and marks an impressive debut from Ahn."
"...Drive My Car suggests that, with the right combination of people riding together, you may be able to arrive, intact, somewhere special."
"If your tolerance for envelope-pushing crudeness and deadpan delirium allows it, this crass comedy might be just what the gastroenterologist ordered."
"The magic of “Matilda” is still strong today, and the message it sends out (“You are not alone”) is something we all need to continue to hear."
"...a sunny recollection of an 80's childhood, and specifically a love story between a boy and his aging grandmother, Minari is a feel-good movie with heart..."
Garcia delivers a nerve-jangling tour de force tryout that will be appreciated by out-of-work actors for years to come.
Bound to become THE family entertainment choice for the holiday season. It's a blockbuster. Deal with it.
Downey charms the heck out of the opportunity he's given.
Director Kevin Asch shows a skilled hand that belies his tyro status. He moves the story along briskly and to the point and gets solid performances from his talented cast.
"What to do when a relatively small, modest budgeted urban comedy becomes a massive critical and word-of-mouth hit? Make a sequel to cash in on the phenomenon, of course. It is the Hollywood way, after all..."
"A film that is oh-so enchanting and charming thanks to eye-popping visuals, perfect voice casting and a fantastical story for all ages."
A sinister tapestry of urban unease and feminist fury that turns an ordinary domestic setting into a place of skulking terror. Original and deeply creepy.
Jia Zhangke creates atmospheres and images of great poetic breath that are full of suggestive power and meaning. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Truly romantic movies seem to be a rarer and rarer thing in contemporary cinema and, like Max Ophüls and Jacques Demy before him, Wright is almost peerless in his ability to make an audience swoon and suffer in maximalist splendor."
"Long, lyrical takes - including a startling shot of a floating funeral procession - and Schubert's 'Death And The Maiden' on the soundtrack remind us that forbidden passion will only end in tears. The Danube's rarely seemed so blue."
"In the main, Jaume Collet-Serra is making a character-driven drama about betrayed honor, and the result is a film closer in spirit to the baggage-rich crime novels of Dennis Lehane than dumb multiplex fare."
"It might not be perfect, but this ""Papillon"" definitely has wings."
"A charming, quietly satisfying work, Adam is a commendable film. Sensitively written and directed by Mayer, it's given shape and dimensionality by Dancy, who delivers a tremendous performance that lends the film genuine humanity."
"Thrillingly paced, ravishingly shot and eerily topical, Sicario 2 retains much of its predecessor's dark charm despite its shuffled creative personnel. But a jarringly Hollywood ending dulls its overall impact."
"Hall, making his feature debut, rarely strays from the underdog sports movie template, but the two appealing young leads come as a welcome blast of deodorant to this stale narrative armpit."
"Mary and The Witch's Flower is a colorful and visually stunning spectacle, a film that packs plenty of detail within its frames."
"In truth, mother! can be about whatever you want it to, making it one of those rare films that you can appreciate without actually having to enjoy any second..."
"It's a fierce performance, not because Rodriguez is a seasoned actress -- she's not -- but because she brings such a magnificent, 'prove-it-to-me' snarl to the role."
The script is elegant and the performances are dignified.
The Hughes Brothers have wisely leapt out of their niche by doing this project -- From Hell is a terrific thriller.
"Will lights and hardware be ready? Can they afford the $200K demanded by headliner Rihanna? The viewer's pulse may rise, too, as Rossi's camera roams frantic hallways, offices and limos."
The infamous butt-chugging scene - will do for audiences what the pie-humping scene in American Pie did for the comedy genre.
"Shannon conveys the contract killer's utter detachment from humanity, providing a mute but menacing presence that wastes few words or emotions."
"The Do-Over is a throwback to classic Adam Sandler films and, while ridiculous, is still a fun ride."
"While it's all so breezy and zippy and girl-power peppy, it's Keaton who makes Mad Money worth a few bucks."
"Rather than tell us that everything we know about Oz is wrong, the filmmakers take what we already know about the wonderful wizard and thread it into a tale about the magic behind cinema itself."
"The best thing about Millions is the freckled, open-faced seriousness of young Etel's Damian, a kid whose faith in goodness can't be bought."
"Like many a meal, the lives of these characters don't necessarily turn out as planned, but the surprises are what provide the extra flavor and delight."
It's an airy confection of delight that is at the same time wised-up and nostalgic. And it aims for a vision of moviemaking that is rhapsodic and earnest without being sentimental.
"As a rugged yet wise exploration of manhood and mortality, All Is Lost gives great Hemingway."
"This is no classic, but director James Wan is a deft conductor who orchestrates the scariest ride of the season from threads of familiarly black melodies."
Jenkins&apos; handling of Chiron&apos;s sexuality is as quietly oblique as everything else in the film&#46;
Another 1990s media spectacle gets a long-overdue autopsy in this slick and riveting documentary.
"A cleverly made combination of mystery, drama and thriller which succeeds due to the rapport between Walker and Glackin."
"[Melville's] style remains haunting and elegantly spare, just right for the kind of hit man who lives in silence, in bare and colorless surroundings, with a lonely caged bird."
It's probably the best cartoon that the studio has released since Mulan.
This is a better story than the platitude that it seems to build up to in the final scene. But it was not all the film it could have been if Zemeckis would have realized where his best material lay.
"A perfect date movie with more stars than script appeal... it's contrived and predictable, although there are a couple of surprises"
So what if the front story is a little contrived?
Hedges wraps up a tremendous year with another powerful gut-punch of a performance.
"George has constructed a fine dramatic feature, and a good first step to educating the masses on this disturbing event."
"Across the board, the performances are terrific: superbly understated and fabulously real."
"George MacKay, Lily-Rose Depp star in dark fairy tale that handles a real-life condition - believing you're not human - with sensitivity and empathy."
Zombie proves once again that he understands how many different ways there are to give an audience the creeps.
"Although it’s difficult to place much faith in what she says about herself, there are interesting insights here in terms of what she says about the experience of life within the Daesh state more generally."
Everything played well for me.
"The film eclipses its conceit, delicately examining both the unique pain that is the loss of intimacy and what makes us fall in love with someone again and again."
"Overall, 'Solo: A Star Wars Story' is a great time at the cinema and really gives Han Solo the spotlight he deserves."
"Morgan's sometimes weird, sometimes whimsical thriller delivers a grown-up blend of film-noir tropes and deadpan humor, for a comedy-drama which starts off lighthearted and then deftly darkens."
"Bergman Island thrums in silence, so it loses steam when, during the second half of the film, reality and fiction begin to explicitly mix. [Full review in Spanish]"
"""On the Beach"" feels more raw and personal than some of Mr. Hong's other work."
Thorough and essential.
"A reminder that Gondry is as brooding as he is silly, even when making an outlier like 'Microbe & Gasoline.'"
Excellent option if you want more than entertainment from... two hours of cinema. [Full review in Spanish]
The Hustle doesn't have a grand message and it doesn't need one. It's two top-notch comedians trying to steal the movie from one another. They both win.
"The film moves on the strength of its aesthetic wonder, almost as if you are watching a feature film made entirely of Tumblr-based gifs and mood boards."
"Skate culture remains in solid hands with filmmaker Stacy Peralta, who fashions his most personal doc on the sport-cum-lifestyle."
"F. Gary Gray's excellent film is as sympathetic as it is bombastic, even when it depicts some of the rough stuff, a lot of the stupid excesses that come with fame, and even some quasi-criminal activities."
"A powerful tale of bravery, compassion and resilience, The Cave is a remarkable film."
A sober and impecable tale. [Full review in Spanish]
[Huppert] manages to make Hansen-Løve's sometimes flat writing come alive at the right moments.
"A fun, energetic caper that tries hard to make you love its characters, but mostly fails to succeed.."
"Though Penn's sympathies lie with McCandless, the director's camera is impassive, and the film's driving intent is to doggedly document rather than celebrate."
Save for two sequences where Sony Pictures' take on the jacket-wearing hopper mirrors Beatrix Potter's ... the film operates between fourth and fifth gears.
The actors' hammy performances only compound the amusement of watching a dynasty propped up by largesse fall to pieces at the very thought of actually having to earn their way in life.
"(Writer-director Patrick) Wang's deliberate, naturalistic style proves to be both a strength and a weakness. In the final analysis, the overall timeliness of Wang's storyline as well as the film's lack of sentimentality is of considerable value."
"Alas, the out-on-the-town portion of the movie is less engaging, although if you're a Smiths fan you can happily rock out to the greatest-hits soundtrack, which has everything from the title track to Panic, Girl Afraid and How Soon Is Now."
The performances are great from top-to-bottom...this was a movie that probably should have been on the big screen.
"It's nervy stuff for any filmmaker but especially one who loves to imbue a sense of melancholy amid the hopeless. For Nightmare Alley, there is no sweet, only bitter."
"A confidently handled, promisingly edgy feature debut...Winter Brothers dribbles into obfuscation its closing stages but has already confirmed Palmason and company as names to watch."
Ozon knows his female characters like few others. [Full review in Spanish]
...a high concept premise that's employed to somewhat bloated yet predominantly entertaining effect by Badham...
As much a loving homage to the horror genre as it is a lament for a civilization on the brink.
"Amin's story is so thick with drama, terror and bloodshed, why create a fictional character to serve as a vantage point?"
"It's a gorgeous, thoughtful, well-acted, morally complex and adult-skewing character study from a major studio. Warts and all, it's exactly what we say Hollywood never bothers to make."
"Joseph Hader breathes life into his role with a raw, understated performance that somewhat compensates for the screenplay's lack of emotional depth."
"It rollicks along with a lot of help from the songs, which lift the spirits as well as lending pace to the plot but the insistence of the message-making means Cinderella and her Prince fall short of making magic together."
"'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness' clearly bears the fingerprints of director Sam Raimi, who infuses the material with the same trippy, giddy spirit which has guided his best work."
English film that powerfully and practically speaks to the communal dimension of our responsibility to the natural world.
"Eggers has solidified his legacy as a wonderful director and there are no doubts, he will be making movies, possibly even Oscar worthy ones, for many years to come."
"Life Animated, is a heart-warming, honest and thoughtful film about how a family made magic out of adversity."
Thinking back on &quot;Suspiria&quot; yields sense memories&#44; electronic haunted-house sounds&#44; stylish and outr&#233; brutality&#46; It&apos;s possible to forget Harper is even in it&#44; but it&apos;s not possible to forget the opening salvo of operatic violence&#46;
Here you get a rare glimpse of exactly what the interface between a West Bank resident and the Israeli army has been like ...
"The audiotapes are the treasures: They resurrect Wilson as a warm, amicable presence. It's almost if Wilson had -- dare we say it? -- invited us pull up a stool to join him for conversation and a (non-alcoholic) drink at a friendly bar."
"The Mojo Manifesto: The Life and Times of Mojo Nixon is a riot, especially for fans, or a good primer for those who don’t know him."
"Frank Capra, who directed, has turned out a more than workmanlike job. The production is charming, cheerful and clever. The action may be slight and there are no big dramatic sequences, but the story moves along quickly and adroitly."
Chris Columbus' only good movie.
"Shawshank aside, this is the best non-horror Stephen King adaptation of the bunch."
It has to be admitted that Scott and his team have retained their ability to make the flesh crawl.
"Very much a character-driven piece, which not only makes the laughs bigger but also earns a deeper involvement."
"Sparse, uncompromising and bewitching. Reichardt has stripped back all but the bare essentials, scattering the characters across the sun-bleached landscape like marbles."
"Kapadia refuses to glamorize Winehouse's addiction as a casualty of rock 'n' roll or just another entry into the ""27 Club."""
"The most ambitious and impressive Coen film in at least a decade, featuring the flat, sun-blasted landscapes of west Texas and an eerily memorable performance by Javier Bardem."
"There's something amiably Quixotic about this recklessly dangerous flight, something innocent, and the vistas of the 19th-century London landscape are really quite something."
"The movie feels uncompromised, genuinely transgressive at times, and smart in the ways it entertains."
Fresh transitions from simmering romance to boiling carnage and in doing so becomes a deliciously moreish movie morsel.
"It's possible to be genuinely moved by that reckoning - and to admire the obvious intelligence and care that have been brought to bear on ""Stillwater"" - without fully buying the trail of contrivances and compromises it leaves in its wake."
"Structurally and tonally, the third act is a challenge. But the longer I linger on it, the more I admire the risk taken by McCarthy."
"There's a heightened edge to I, Daniel Blake, an embittered streak of comedy that keeps the otherwise miserable plot from weighing too heavily."
Even the most televisionally overstimulated will likely enjoy this boy-and-his-dog movie -- which also happens to be a girl-and-her-cat movie too.
"When the visit ends, one is grateful simply to have been in their esteemed company."
"More than a decade after The Blair Witch project turned the mock-doc format into a horror cliche, this low-tech horror show uses it to chilling effect in this story of cynicism vs. things that go bump in the night."
"Opening in domestic contentment, moving through personal anguish and ending with a cosmic lament, it's a simple, wrenching story of love and loss that pries open a window onto eternity."
"It's a fascinating news story, but the film's additional, if entertaining speculations remain just that."
"You will come to think that it's Fate itself that's ultimately imposing itself on its objective, obscuring a present that should be bright. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Mills tells his story with a glancing quirkiness, both affectionate and meandering."
Ruzowitzky depicts the care and attention to detail that went into the operation.
"It's a big enough rarity in itself to find a solid crime/drama these days at the movies, but The Illusionist satiates our hunger for a compelling period piece."
A hobo hops off a freight train in a nameless North American Gomorrah run by a sadistic crime king. Then said hobo cleans up the place by shooting buckets full of guts.
"Has the slow-pulsing vertigo of a psychological thriller & the twists of an elaborate melodrama, but to reduce it to these labels is glib. Caustic & funny but never misanthropic. A study of the ways people actually live, rather than how we assume they do."
Law's committed performance is the biggest selling point for the inconsistent movie.
The imagery on display is amazing&#44; and its power frequently overtakes the screenplay&#46;
"Beauty and the Beast is a lavish spectacle. The major drawback is the total lack of surprise. The film is well made, but plays out exactly as expected."
A hugely successful experiment to see if a movie can captivate an audience with a conversation between two people in real time.
This exploration of tumultuous romance is rare in its scope and frankness.
The genuine charm of the cast will continue to disarm those who can't entirely erase thoughts of guillotines and tumbrils.
"It may not become the Christmas classic Disney is hoping for, but it remains as pretty as a decked-out tree."
Craggy. But worth it for the views.
"Wow, TWO good movies based on Stephen King stories in the same year? You bet. As entertaining as 1408? Not quite."
The final moments of Bad Hair are as fiercely emotive as Truffaut's fabled still-shot ending for 400 Blows. This is grand cinema.
If you don't see yourself in its depiction of intense emotion I both envy and pity you.
Scorsese leaves us pondering: How far can organized religion sustain us in the face of oppression? When does pure faith kick in? And does that belief suffice?
Fever Pitch is respectful and heartfelt about the problems that come with extreme fandom and how they might impinge on the happiness of a person who couldn't care less about Carl Yastrzemski.
"Not bad adventure, nothing special, but not bad"
"Just as the plot threatens to run out of gas, Lin rescues the film with a spate of vastly ridiculous and therefore enjoyable set-pieces, most of which involve means of conveyance designed to make the cars look puny."
The Broken Circle Breakdown is a very American romance. It is also a very European tragedy.
It is the thematically-rich storytelling that makes &apos;Halloween Ends&apos; truly special&#46; Making a film  that is supposed to end an iconic horror-thriller franchise character-driven&#63; It doesn&apos;t get ballsier than that&#46;
This lively animated adventure keeps us entertained even if the story and characters aren't particularly well-developed
"Underneath its mechanical safety and mild-manners, this movie does have some heart and some muscle. You'll come to like having it around, even if you thought you'd already moved on."
A surprisingly real male relationship examination.
An exciting&#44; educational and entertaining film&#44; set to instil wonder in audiences of just about any age&#46;
"2007's cool psychological suspense piece Yella, with Hoss as a woman who can't quite escape her troubled past, was one of the first films that made the international reputations of both its star and her frequent director Christoph Petzold."
"This pared-down film version mostly captures the stormy symphonic interplay of nasty recriminations, mocking taunts and hurtful revelations hurled with corrosive aplomb by a top-notch ensemble of actors."
"A beautifully mounted, fiercely intelligent, bracingly alive literary adaptation that remains an unabashed crowd-pleaser."
"There's plenty to laugh at in Stern and Sundberg's picture, both in the footage of Rivers on stage and in front of the filmmakers' camera."
Lonsdale carries this love story&#44; even if it spends a little too much time focused on its outlandish premise &amp; not enough time on the actual romance&#46;
"Hustlers is brash, often crude and unabashedly chaotic, but it is its ""buddy movie"" sensibility which ultimately wins the day. A robustly made, beautifully acted and decidedly engaging story about some unlikely heroines."
An almost unimaginably thrilling experience.
"A bespectacled, bow-tie wearing beagle with a genius IQ and a penchant for terrible puns... Erudite, pedantic, prissily formal, he sounds a lot like Niles from Frasier but he'd make a great Dog-tor Who."
Writer/director Jason Orley's debut is funny ... but it's also surprisingly insightful about why these characters do the things they do and let it get so out of control...
"At the end of the day, while unnecessary, ""Army of Thieves"" thrives because Schweighöfer's go-for-broke attitude pushes this overlong, low-stakes, heist caper into the realm of enjoyability."
"Although Hall's impressive debut is about very specific people in a particular place and time, the questions it raises and the experiences it dramatizes are broader, more universal."
An absolutely heartbreaking tearjerker...
"...a brilliant, precise cast. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Overall, Arctic Tale's one true message is clear: Stop global warming before it's too late."
The exploration is deep&#44; very deep&#44; so much so that one could easily imagine a much darker and edgier film could have been the result&#46; As it is&#44; &quot;Seriously Red&quot; sneaks up on you&#46;
"Those who were furious at Tyson will be made even angrier by Toback's film, for here is a fresh provocation-an attempt to restore to Tyson the human dimensions that have been taken from him (by himself, of course, as well as by others)."
"An existing affection for Waititi's specific brand of humour will help audiences embrace this film, but the bold optimism of his worldview comes through in any context."
"A fascinating look at the intersection of commerce, celebrity, and controversy."
[A] joyfully oddball work about friends who aren't your friends and the price one young couple must pay for always being happy.
"When Stone finally achieves a comfortable balance between the pretty young things and the cornucopia of crazies, the film truly comes to full life as the lurid, down and dirty entertainer one hopes for."
"Even though it's not exactly easy to watch the protracted deaths of two children, this is not only one of the greatest anime ever, but also an important (anti-) war film. A moving masterpiece."
"Here, Jeunet’s bright colors and prankish manipulation of space makes a suburban home and its lookalike environs an appropriate carnival atmosphere. Big Bug turns a spiritual and political pandemic into a three-dimensional funhouse mirror."
The story sets out to be that whimsical escapist romance with a European setting where love and heartbreak span decades in that mystery format. Director Augustine Frizzell pulls out all the stops at making this film the unabashed epic romance that it is.
"The feel-good story and sing-along production numbers are likely to please the movie's target audience of tween girls, but there's not a whole lot in ""Annie"" to win their parents over."
"Egerton is so gosh-darn sweet as the skier, and Hugh Jackman makes such a swell jerk as his trainer, Bronson Peary, that you'll take the ride with them anywhere"
"Enough cannot be said about the sharpness and intelligence of Ade's script, and how credibly it sketches the connections between its superficially disparate co-protagonists."
"Don't be surprised if you shed a little tear in Miss Potter. This enchanting biopic about the world of the creator of Peter Rabbit is warm and funny, revealing and moving."
The film...is more interested in the waywardness of almost everyone's longings and in their failures of self-preservation than it is about Lulu's particular immorality or recklessness.
"This delivers some frighteningly vertiginous moments once Petit steps off the South Tower into empty space, and Zemeckis wisely milks the climactic wire walk, which lasted 45 minutes and drew a crowd of breathless onlookers below, for all it's worth."
"...has a spicy, sweaty, sun-baked sense of place and an air of magical realism, both of which enhance its central themes of love, passion, perception and faith."
A bold exploration of some of the challenges faced by investigative journalists in an age of dirty politics.
Disney should celebrate the day they first teamed up with Jon Favreau as a national holiday.
Coda isn't merely a feel-good movie; it's the pinnacle of a new wave of post-Donald Trump cinema that can only be described as 'happycore'.
"On the plus side: the battle scenes, brilliantly filmed with a hand-held camera; a remarkable portrayal of a sadistic English officer by... Donald Sutherland; and clever art direction... On the debit side is Al Pacino's ludicrous performance."
"Offers a devil-may-care approach and a deliciously wicked sense of humor, a top-flight performance from Michelle Yeoh, and an emotionally true central theme..."
&#927; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#959;&#961;&#966;&#969;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962; &#966;&#945;&#954;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#965; Tati &#948;&#951;&#956;&#953;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#943; &#941;&#957;&#945; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#967;&#99

"It likely won't receive all the Oscar hoopla that many are expecting, [but] American Gangster is one of the first films of the year to actually deserve the recognition."
The veteran director has gifted us with yet another tantalising&#44; transcendent exploration of the consequences of our endless attempts to modify our sacks of flesh in order to feel something&#46;

Yonebayashi's unwavering faith in the clear values and direct narrative structures of a good storybook energize his rousing entertainment with sweep and drive.
"Synthetic outdoor backdrops look oddly out of place in some scenes, but the show happily brims with gusto and melody. Howard Keel and Jane Powell top the cast."
It's only when the giddiness passes that you realise you've witnessed not only an incredible true story but a fitting tribute to an unforgettable landmark.
"Presents the carnal as an intellectual exercise, vicious and unremitting in externalizing cultural violence about gender norms in a stylized satire that will leave you suitably discombobulated."
"Well-acted and well-written, for mature teens+."
"By the time the film gets where it's going, viewers may identify more than they expect with those who've been controlled by others with hidden agendas."
"Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris movingly weaves a tale about finding an outer beauty that reflects the purity of heart within. It’s as pleasant as you want a movie like this to be, yet it does so without simplification that patronizes the audience."
"Happily is a dark comedy with an all-star cast of characters, building tension in a wound up house of deception, boiling over into a wild and weird getaway."
What makes Depp so incredible as an on screen presence is his generosity. He hardly commands the screen as much as he shares it with his co-stars.
There&#8217;s nothing didactic about &#8216;T&#225;r&#44;&#8217; nor any simple moral you can hashtag or put on a bumper sticker&#46; The film is complicated&#46; Difficult&#46; Much like its protagonist&#46;
"Detachment is a powerful, incisive and emotionally stirring film that provides keen insight into an over-saturated topic."
"Django is infectiously rousing and exuberantly subversive. Say what you will about his insensitivities, nothing in Tarantino's approach is condescending or pretentious."
I've been sold on the rich possibilities of these new movies. I'm letting the Force in this time.
A compelling report.
"There are a few wrong notes, and the ending is too enigmatic for its own good, but for a studio production the film is uncommonly intelligent and uncompromising."
Almost triumph(s) over the old-fashioned forces of Disney tradition.
Barnard poetically suggests that the absence of good parenting turns childhood into a purgatory that can only end with adulthood's cruel arrival.
"It's a corker -- big, exciting, opulently designed, gorgeously shot and blessed with a top cast."
Zendaya and John David Washington have rarely been better. [Full review in French]
...a surprisingly touching drama about finding that balance between our past and present selves.
A medley of familiar Christmas classics...with a distinct Muppet spin.
Duplicity is a light and airy affair that has far too much fun with zingy one-liners to be concerned with the rather relevant dirty laundry that's being aired out.
"To varying degrees of success, it attempts to prominently display Al Carbee's creations, yet keeps undermining his art in favor of investigating his skewed relationship to everyday realities."
"You Should Pay Nine Bucks for This: If you've been feeling sluggish and grumpy lately. I recommend daily viewings. If it doesn't make you wildly happy, then I want to hear from you."

"Working as both a thriller and a mystery, the movie has all eyes glued to the screen and all brains in overdrive."
"Just barely ""fresh"" but really keeps your attention with unique touches which are now common in prime time dramatic television for free."
A great introduction and a fascinating insight into the mind of a true legend.

"The movie's point isn't so much to be a juicy expose on a TV celebrity, but to ask hard questions about how he was in the world, and to ask: why can't there be more like him?"
Ace in the Hole does for print media what Network and Nightcrawler would do later on for television and it still rings true today.
"""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is a fun ride that will put a lump in your throat, a tear in your eye, and more than one terrific song in your heart. Go with it."

Mike Nichols and veteran cinematographer Robert Surtees threw out the DGA playbook for The Graduate.
The deft and deadly Lee can turn virtually anything from a wooden door to a tray of silverware into a lethal weapon.

&#8220;Goodnight Mommy&#8221; is a roll of the dice&#46; If the premise intrigues you&#44; you&#8217;re taking your chances&#46; Nicely shot and paced&#44; it will hold your interest&#44; but it is the ending that will determine whether you consider it time well spent&#46;

"The Perfect Man isn't perfect, but it's not bad company for 100 minutes."
"The real humor comes, once again from Murphy, whose Donkey is so genuinely funny and clever that he very nearly steals the film. Except that it's stolen by Banderas as a rogue Puss In Boots outlaw hired by the King to do in Shrek."
Steven Spielberg's best movie in at least a decade.
Explores with creative and comic energy the difficulties of the sibling bond and the mixed feelings we often have for those who share our history.
"Walt Disney has no peer in the field of animated features and his latest, based on the familiar King Arthur legend, is brimming with mirth, music and magic."
"It's all tease in the first half, and all implausibilities in the second. Still, Thomas is always worth watching, in French or in English, whether her mood be chilly or tropical."
An essential documentary that helps explain today's politics (and perhaps tomorrow's) around the world. [Full Review in Spanish]
"This imbalance in the screenplay keeps Far From Men from its chance at greatness. Nevertheless, its strong stance of taking the side of humanity, even in the face of a civil war in which sides are expected to be taken, deserves respect and applause."
This is the kind of intimate little indie that I wish we got more of. 
"The thrilling beauty of this reading of Beowulf is that it makes [the characters] feel modern... These people live in the real world, not in a fable and not in a history book."
"Alfred Hitchcock's 1955 comedy has long been overshadowed by the masterworks that surround it, but it's a wonderful, fanciful film, the most optimistic movie he ever made -- a fairy tale among nightmares."
"Ultimately very breezy, Jumbo makes a claim for people to enjoy love wherever they find it..."
"Communist Poland in the 1950s is a frigid land of slippery political sands in director Pawel Pawlikowski's graceful, gorgeously retro, black-and-white dedication to his parents."
"Don't go into this film hoping for the gore of the Saw franchise or the ridiculousness of the Scary Movie series. This is more lite PG-13 gore, nevertheless quite enjoyable."
"Haunting and ominous, written, directed and acted nearly to perfection."
"Deftly directed by Stephen Frears, the film is funnier than you might expect. The opening sequence alone is a mini masterpiece of pacing. And Dench gets to show enormous range."
"Casino Royale is the riskiest of Bonds, and it immediately establishes itself among the series' top tier because almost every gambit pays off."
"Like 'The Lord of the Rings,' 'Spider-Man' is grandly, emotionally affecting in a way that it had started to seem that Hollywood blockbusters never would be again."
"Demonstrates how homage can provide the undercurrent for a films visual and narrative language, yet go beyond simplistic checkboxing of references...Plays like a cold winter storm with occasional gusts punctuating the biting, incessant frigidity."
"Quincy is lovingly put together and recounts one of the most distinguished and interesting careers in American entertainment. However, it's almost too much to fit into a single movie."
"This sequel to the Kingsman: The Secret Service (based on the comicbook series) veers in several directions, but the last half hour when things come together, more than makes up for the wait."
"Like Jean-Paul Sartre's No Exit-tentialism, but more crowded and with the musk of bottled-up testosterone."

Watcher showcases writer&#47;director Chloe Okuno as an auteur poised in her singular vision&#46;

"Whatever the flaws, it's lively and colorful enough to satisfy the target audience as a fitting close to the ultra-popular series."
"Funny, clever, action-packed, and rocking with music and kaleidoscopic graphics, but it's the underlying messages that make it a great family film."
a complex plot that manages to balance character writing with slam-bang action sequences

"We're invited to contemplate the torments of mental instability and the awful intimacies of family life, as well as whatever malignant forces may lurk behind the veil of everyday existence."

Logan is a dark and thrilling finale for Wolverine. Director James Mangold brings stark realism to the comic genre.
"On a whole, it's still fun and cute."
"What remains is a fascinating, Kafkaesque portrayal of justice (or lack thereof) in modern China, but it's no knee-slapper and, at more than two hours, it's long for a comedy."
An eerie and intimate psychological thriller with Hitchcockian tones harkening back to the Shyamalan's early 2000s run that put him on the filmmaking map.
"A round of hide and seek with some blue bloods gets, well, bloody in the very funny horror-satire Ready or Not."
"To a tale which is, happily, naughty but nice about love and marriage and set with wistful witty tunes and recitatives, Vincente Minnelli adds his own special touch of sophistication and burlesque at the expense of the period's fashions and manners."
"Funny, sad and bittersweet - one of Noah Baumbach's finest."
Writer/director Thomas Robert Lee's The Curse of Audrey Earnshaw ... doesn't do much new but does present its story with a strong command of mood.
"A tale of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy."
It&#8217;s been years &#8212; maybe as far back as &#8220;All the President&#8217;s Men&#8221; in 1976 &#8212; that a movie has captured the craft and the passion of journalism as precisely and as smartly as director Maria Schrader&#8217;s &#8220;She Said&#46;&#8221;
"Love and Honor is a welcome affirmation of Yamada's determination to maintain his historic workload, even while in his 70s."
"A magnetic, brilliant and captivating film where the director knows how to tense the threads that unite the imagination of the spectator with the imagery of distant worlds. [Full review in Spanish]"

"I could not possibly care less about football, and I fell hopelessly in love with this movie, and with the can-do amateur team it introduces us to."
"While it lacks outright Cronenbergian pleasures, ""Maps to the Stars"" repeatedly connects as a dark comedy and insidious display of rancid human behavior."
Strangely inert and lifeless.
Johnstone&#8217;s film revels in the humor of its premise complete with pop songs and children&#8217;s toys gone awry&#46;
A striking phantasm of affection&#44; regrets&#44; and remembered accounts that might be factually inaccurate but emotionally unfeigned&#46;
"Disney's multi-Oscar nominated musical is not as good as Mary Poppins to which it's often compared, but Angela Lansbury is well-cast and most of the visual effects, which won the Oscar, are impressive."
"Green concocts a series of deliciously telling moments of behavior or lines of dialogue, and a game cast and crew are equal to the offbeat content."
"Eastwood takes the film in some interesting directions by sticking to documented facts, zeroing in on Richard's reluctant decision to fight back against the system he loves..."
"Each time the script wobbled into cliché, I cringed. The actresses are too talented to flail on hallucinogens. But they launch into idiocy with so much energy that even the dumbest scenes lift-off."
"The outrage of actor-turned- writer-director Peter Mullan is palpable, and every frame of this shocking and occasionally exploitative film is designed to ensure that this reaction is contagious."
"Williams delivers a solid, twinkle-free (though closed-off) performance, but the film as a whole can't decide what it wants to be."
A passable yet underwhelming sequel...
"It will make you feel wonderful, and if you're like me, whose emotional barometer responds in the positive with tears, take plenty of tissues."

"If you've been waiting a long time for the next in-your-face sensation in the Pulp Fiction tradition, check out Sin City."

"It's an impressive depiction of the culture, as well as a powerful exploration of a range of urgent themes."
Deliciously macabre... Nightcrawler is popcorn snuff.
A complex film about the minefield of loyalty and betrayal.

As a snapshot of an age and life stage&#44; Trier helms a film that&apos;s canny and incisive&#44; also perfects the sensation of constantly zipping onwards even when it seems as if you&apos;re stuck&#44; and knows how to find both joy and darkness in tandem&#46;

"At the movie's climax, they [the actors] bring new life to liberte, egalite and, of course, fraternite."

A pleasantly nonsensical roller-coaster ride.
Wonderful book adaptation with strong female character.
The beauty of this adaptation of Belgian author and illustrator Gabrielle Vincent's characters is its sheer simplicity and sincerity.

"Exquisite on every level, Dreamchild is a film to cherish."

"For casual race fans, Racing Dreams is a real eye-opener. And it's a darned entertaining way to get a handle on a sport that can seem like a bunch of cars doing circles for a crowd that seems most interested in seeing that next epic wreck."
"It's essentially a soundtrack -- and a good one at that, led by Timberlake and Anna Kendrick, with contributions from Gwen Stefani -- in search of a story."

"A goofball riff on the pirate-movie genre, this sequel is as insubstantial as popcorn -- and as delicious."
"Cloying smart, gleefully mischievous and resplendently, stupendously gross."
"Not Okay is like many “internet movies” before it – approaching uncanny valley, somewhat obvious, just a little off — but this unsettling darkness makes it a solid entry into the canon of just-okay social media films."
I'll Sleep When I'm Dead may take its place with Get Carter as a classic British gangster film.
It's a very sly piece of filmmaking.
"This is the arid equivalent of Werner Herzog's Aguirre, Wrath of God. Reichardt offers the minimum of genre conventions and none of the genre's satisfactions or resolutions."

"The Sacrament is worth a watch for fans of the director and cast, but its lack of purpose or anything to say limits its staying power dramatically."

Deep Impact hits the bull's eye for sci-fi action thrills and the sheer power of an engrossing adventure that marries plausible ideas with a jump into the beyond.
"Though it may seem Biller is mountain an assault on delightfully garish exploitation fare - with overemphatic titles like ""Vixen!"", ""Score!"" and ""The Lickerish Quartet"" - that's not quite what she's doing."
"Suffers the same problems that most sitcom to movie adaptations suffer from, but fans of the series should find lots to love."

A feat of photography.
"Corseted courtesies and the candlelit rooms with their flickering pools of light never overwhelm the story's contemporary resonance. The clash of male assumption and jealousy, and female wiles and independence, has no shortage of present-day parallels."

"Be it Panda-Rific, Perfectly Panda or Panda-monium, one thing is for certain when we're talking about Kung Fu Panda 3 - It's the Best.Panda.Ever."

What's funny about exploitation? You'd be amazed.
"One of the two very smart things that the film does is to keep the original 1975 setting, as the story would have been altered far too much to be set in the digital age."
"Clooney is remarkable in Alexander Payne's film about loss, confusion and getting by."
"Republican, Democrat, or Independent, the only side THE REPORT chooses is the fight for human rights."

"Labaki's realistic camera following Zain, whose family is undocumented migrants, takes viewers into the heart of a very real, universal issue, no, not about refugees, but the problem of unfit parenting."
"Ostensibly a comedy about inspiration and creativity, The Muse is a clunker that's actually painfully lacking in both qualities."
"[Abdel] Kechiche knows his subject and the film reflects the warmth and understanding with which he views it, though it is inordinately long at 2 hrs and 30 minutes."
"Shows that it's not only possible to make a spine-tingling World War II saga without bloodshed, but also to use such stories to examine the agonizing-but-necessary values of conscience, loyalty and forgiveness."
"An attractive, energetic young cast and some witty, off-center visual humor make the resultant laughs more than worth the wait."
"With so many ideas in play, the film is never dull. Sometimes it's also funny, perceptive and nuanced. Things get deeper and dirtier as it rolls on, but not really clearer, in terms of purpose."
"Mary Poppins Returns is solid, reliable family fare and only the hardest heart will leave the cinema bereft of a smile. It might not be another classic, but it's brolly good fun."

"While watching ""Gold,"" I felt I had seen the story before. And, I realize that I had, many times and ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" comes to mind - without Bogey and bandits that ""don't need no stinking badges."""
"For me, Ferrara and Keitel will always be the bad lieutenant, but Werner Herzog is probably the only director qualified to take this on, and his bizarre reboot has a fascination all of its own."
"What it all amounts to is a tremendously funny feel good film that doesn't quite stand on its own so much as it plays as a great (the BEST, really) companion-piece to The Room that a cult film fan could ask for."
The film set a strong tone for modern summer blockbuster films in 1993 and continues to be one of the most iconic movies ever to hit a silver screen in the summer months.
a cheerfully silly caper comedy that mixes in a little of 'My Fair Lady' and a lot of 'The Honeymooners' as it breezes along. ...Allen and Tracey Ullman spar and slander each other with an almost maniacal glee.

This British import is a good-natured comedy featuring several laugh-out-loud sequences.

"The plot is ludicrous but one doesn't go to Luc Besson action films for character-driven storytelling; they go for exactly what this film promises and delivers -- frenetic, inspired, grin-inducing action."
"What struck me in now is that it eschews the plot, and going off into flights of comic fancy including re-doing the ending a couple times until theyre satisfied. The result is still funny, still EXCELLENT and SCHWING! Two on-air reviews in one link! "
"If these movie cops were your local police, you'd want them strung up on charges and locked away. In a fictionalized past, sure, it's still amoral, but that would only be a problem if the movie ever took itself seriously."
"A streamlined, ""Reader's Digest"" version of real-life events. However, it is a gorgeous, worthwhile re-telling thanks to a fine cast; top-notch art direction; a beautiful, mostly piano score by Stephen Warbeck; and Gabriel Beristain's ravishing cinematog"
"It's entirely ridiculous, but it gallops cheerfully along; everything is carried off with flair and ingenuity."
"There's enough juice to sustain a fan's interest for awhile. It ain't much, but watching Scully and Mulder inch closer romantically, and seeing some cool special effects is worth the price of admission."
"As comfort-blanket romcoms go, it is the rare one that will not bring you out in a rash."
"A languorous, visually striking movie about love and loss, infused with the earnestness of young people struggling with powerful emotions and with evolving ideas about life, death, art, freedom and responsibility."

Foreign-film comfort food...at its best in exploring the psychology of the adopted.

&#91;Newell and Attanasio&#93; pay as much attention to emotional details as to the clockwork details of mob life&#46;

"There is nothing left for the critic at this point but to corroborate all that has been said of it, to add his own warmest words of acclaim"

"In a swift 86 minutes, director Meadows and co-writer/star Considine give us a methodical, handsome, emotionally intelligent version of the revenge flick."
"Its mock-artistic thriller trappings notwithstanding, 'In Bruges' is basically a funny, tragicomic two-hander, with the casting of Farrell alongside Gleeson enabling a pleasing Irish inflection."
"A competent genre movie enlivened by vivid sense of place/culture - shot on location in New Orleans, delving into the world of merchant seaman/dock workers/smugglers."
"Treating his seafood substantially better than Oldboy, Jiro is a miracle of perfectionism married to expertise. The same can said for Gelb's loving documentary."
Franciosi grabs the film by its shoulders and turns it into a searing&#44; singular experience&#46;
A slick weepie made by smart guys who want you to know they're better than the schlockmeisters.
A totally absorbing movie.
A non-stop action fest.
Good but not great. Streep and Roberts feel a little too much like stunt-casting.
"Broader and more accessible than either Shaun Of The Dead or Hot Fuzz, Paul is pure Pegg and Frost - clever, cheeky and very, very funny."
Skyfall returns Bond to Solid Ground
"Pitt's ridiculous, wildly over-the-top performance somehow keeps it all together."

"It's a surprisingly epic and spirited film, driven by an adventurous spirit and enough clever fun to keep things fresh during a sometimes long-winded ride."

"The film is one of those rare beasts, with a sense of genuine permanency. It beds down in your mind, like it is preparing to live there for a while. It is not pretty, but it is, sometimes, very beautiful."
One of 2022&apos;s 20 best films&#46;
"At 89, Morenos petite frame still radiates star charisma and vitality. Viewers will come away from this film feeling like Moreno didnt just live life; she earned it."

Even Cecil B. DeMille might have been impressed.
"If you want a film that is big and true and tough, go see Synecdoche. And then go see it again, because it's so rich with ideas that you can't possibly get them all the first time around."
Amalric&#8217;s emotional mystery&#44; as its fragments and enigmas unfold&#44; isn&#8217;t necessarily a journey for viewers to solve but rather a state of mind to understand&#58; the bewitchingly poignant story of a woman&#8217;s fertile&#44; possibly perilous&#44; coping mechanism&#46;
"Stunning visuals and imagery, exceptional directing, and stellar performances by all the cast members make this the can't miss movie of the year."

[A] satirical tableau of a Poland that does not recognize itself. [Full review in Spanish]
"Taking the long view that Winner's case is hardly an aberration, the director seems to inhabit the role of whistleblower as well, upending an ongoing narrative put forth by those outside the government that continues to see that true justice isn't served."
The Wayans are the masters of spoof.
intelligent and moving
"A loving paean to Bond, Flint, Helm and their ilk (as well as a myriad of outlandish villains), the film knows its turf and only missteps when it ventures into more contemporary territory."
"Whether it's ""Alex Rider,"" ""Agent Cody Banks"" or ""Spy Kids,"" plenty have tried to adapt the 007 shtick to younger characters, with demonstrably dopey results. In the end, the reason it works for Vaughn is that he's making the film for adults."
"The filmmakers have created an intensely stark and visceral representation of this hellish place, and the cinematography is intimate and stunning."
Decent 70s thriller.
"Girl Asleep might be about an awakening, but it's not a sexual awakening, and this is one teen comedy in which, at long last, the geek doesn't get the girl."
"Boasting a clever title, this is an inspired piece of lunacy about sociology versus biology, with terrific performances from Ben Stiller and his two sets of parents."
"Splice went down smooth, with its sleek surfaces, terrific special effects and disturbing sexiness."

"THE PIANIST is Polanski's most personal work to date, and perhaps because of that, Polanski seems to have rediscovered the cinematic voice he had as a young man."
A pleasure. [Full review in Spanish]
"At least Ratner knows how to handle both action and drama on screen, even if subtlety and substance fall by the wayside."
Judging it by itself as a solo slasher film from 2018 it aced it... as a sequel it did even better.
Pfeiffer is outstanding.
"The directors jump into an impoverished, fast-moving life, and never attempt to put on the brakes for the sake of providing audience comfort."

"Director Ryusuke Hamaguchi uses his ample running time to help us understand his complex, guarded characters so we cannot help but feel happy when they find some measure of happiness"
It's Swamp Thing. It's not Swamp Hamlet or MacBeth Thing.
"Cage delivers a superb performance in a role that seems specifically tailored to his abilities, helping Sarnoski find a brutal reality underneath what initially appears to be a silly concept for a revenge picture."
"[Fellin] turns the world into his circus and, in a liberated, quasi-documentary style, resurrects some of history's great pagliacci with their cornucopia of practical jokes, smashed hats, pulled chairs, popping balloons and squirting flowers."
Silly but irresistible.
"While The Long Night may not be revolutionary, it's definitely got its own dark magic."
"On the run in New York with every hitman in creation on his tail, JW needs the skills of a samurai, the reflexes of a striking snake, the speed and stealth of a wolf, a hide of pig iron and a perfectly tailored suit."
"It is a sitcom with teeth and haunting moral echoes, no small amount of vulgarity and a smart streak of comedy."
"It sounds like the latest release from Blumhouse Productions, but the documentary from filmmakers Shannon Service and Jeffrey Waldron is more frightening than any fabricated specter as the underbelly of Thailand's seafood trade is exposed."
"Imagine a Spike Jonze-Charlie Kauffman-Michel Gondry-style film but with a warm, beating heart instead of cool, detached hipster irony."
"The result is a decent picture, if one that leans pretty heavily on the future resonance of every interaction and conversation."
Springy and funny. A literary adaptation for people who don't like literary adaptations.
"Sorkin owes more to the slam-bang mayhem of Danny Boyle than the visual elegance of David Fincher, but mostly he gets out of the way of his writing - delivering for good and ill (but mostly good) a full-throttle Sorkin ride."
"In spots, the movie can be hysterical. But, for the most part, its appeal is not unlike that of a veteran rock band putting on a greatest hits concert."
"Anchored by Denzel Washington's steely presence, it's a spare, brutal vigilante exercise, with an element of righteous revenge mixed into the balance."
There's something quite wonderful about having a bear that is this free to speak its mind.
"In an age when the Shrek films make oral sex jokes and Cars 2 flip-flops between tedium and terror, the real pleasure of the gentle, graceful Winnie the Pooh is that it is a kid's film that really, truly works for kids."
The performances by Michael Douglas and Matt Damon are wonderful. The fug of jealousy and drug-fuelled paranoia is very well maintained.

It's such a superlative movie that it seems better the second time you see it.
"Few films in recent history have moved me quite like Supernova, a sensitive drama starring Stanley Tucci as one half of a gay couple who is slowly but surely succumbing to dementia."
Orphan&#58; First Kill is every bit as satisfyingly twisted as its predecessor&#44; and certainly counts as the most gloriously demented horror surprise since Malignant&#46;
"""Christine"" is based on true events, and I suspect it's all the more powerful if you don't know what happens at the end. I did, but the film still gripped me."
"This latest adaptation of a rarely well-filmed novel makes a strong effort to capture the stiflingly provincial world that Flaubert was able to describe in such precise, painstaking detail on the page."

"Ben Is Back successfully skirts cliches and subverts addiction drama conventions, but it eventually veers into quasi-thriller territory built around the search for a stolen dog..."
"Just when it seemed as if we had lost Tom Cruise to the ranks of paycheck-cashing automatons no longer interested in applying themselves on screen, along comes American Made to show there's still some life left in the maverick actor."
"Tonally inconsistent, at least it errs on the side of ambition and cleverness; its box-office failure suggests that male genre fans don't want to be asked to identify with the victims instead of the menace."
"Gray’s latest, Armageddon Time, is a flawed work. But it sees the filmmaker at his most vulnerable, as he twists the camera back on himself and asks: of all the paths that brought me here, how many were carved out by my own privilege? "
"""Red Rocket"" remains such a blisteringly raw and febrile character study because of how things fluctuate along the fixed orbit of its star."

Guest seems to know just how far he can stretch reality without losing the crucial texture of verisimilitude. This is a comedy even cat lovers might adore.
On paper it looks like a carbon copy of Highlander but Theron&#46;&#46;&#46; and a series of entertaining action set pieces that are directed with verve and style by director Gina Prince-Bythewood&#46;&#46;&#46; prove you can teach The Old Guard new tricks&#46;
"Stop me if you've heard this one, but sometimes politicians get us into wars that last forever and go nowhere under false pretenses."
An assault of expressionistic techniques...
"There's tons of delicious suspense of the horror-flick variety... and plenty of Spielbergian shock-awe... but what makes it one of the most satisfying examples of found-footage flicks yet is its observational, journalistic ethos."
"The film’s effectiveness depends on what occurs on the way to the answers, and in this respect Shyamalan’s wit and sincerity serve him and the audience well."

Nelms' screenplay slyly comments on the holiday's superficial elements by cutting away the sentimental veneer.
"A witty exploration of black American culture, past and present."

Much of the film is very funny as it explores the eccentricities and daily routines of these Londoners.
"Perhaps the film isn't a grandiose statement of splintered lives, but it's an agreeable drama, best when it stays close to the decomposing heart of a professional liar."
This is a work of profound and melancholic beauty; every bit as essential in the 21st century as it was in the 20th.
"A precursor to the far better Rear Window, but noir has seen better days."

"Nonetheless, these reservations are not intended to diminish the eminent merits of The Best Years of Our Lives, in which the mastery of one of the world's greatest directors is ever on display. "
"[Idris] Elba isn't afraid to keep it real when it comes to visualising D's slow descent to darkness, transitioning from colourful Kingston to run-down, gritty London."
"Jesse and Celine seem like real people, complete with flaws and weaknesses. That they become so fleshed out in such a brief running time is a testament to the script and Hawke and Delpy's acting abilities."
"Warm and witty, but essentially an R-rated TV movie/history lesson."
Reaps its full portion of machismo's horrors and hosannas.
"For anyone who appreciates artistic integrity and is interested in genuinely independent films, the prolific and highly personal work of John Sayles is essential viewing."
Seeing is definitely worth believing in the Hong Kong supernatural thriller The Eye. Quite imaginative and cerebrally challenging for a spookfest narrative...never blinks when it comes to its inherent hair-raising high jinks.
It's not often that you find a film that's completely bonkers and wholesome all in one package. PG: PSYCHO GOREMAN has this in spades.
"The result is a low-key mind-bender that feels half-scripted, half improvised, and -- for the most part -- rather surprisingly compelling."

"If your heartstrings are tugged and your eyes water a bit, it’s all earned."

A not-very-good movie redeemed by a car chase for the ages.
Wiseman's films are as much living organisms as they are subjective portraits.
Despite the early plot give-away the film's robust caricatures and gentle humour keep things bowling along nicely.

It is beautifully acted by leads Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva and inspires sympathy.

"Touching, funny story of childhood in Sweden."
"Wenders trains his camera on photographer Sebastiao Salgado and the result, though not without flaws, is an invigorating and interesting observation of the man, his work and the entire medium of photography."
The Iron Lady is a clever and oddly touching entertainment.
"I've never seen the stage musical Rent, but the movie had me at hello."
"A sleek, surprising and surefire thriller that will grab you by the throat."
"This heightened atmosphere sets the perfect tone for the story, which is rife with scheming, torqued emotion, and of course, incredible fight scenes."
There's so much to love here! I appreciated seeing Estella's (Cruella's) creativity shine and her bravery in facing hardship.
The twists and turns in this mystery-thriller would be enough for us to recommend it. Splendid performances by Kidman and Stan seal the deal.
"There isn't much originality in this rude female-led comedy, but its observations on single life are a nicely updated twist on the Sex and the City formula."
A devastating exploration of repressed desire and unspoken longing.
"A solid if far-fetched thriller that still entertains, even as it goes off the rails. Terrible title, mind."
"A bittersweet teen film that has much to offer even those of us who have, in theory, grown up."
"""Our Idiot Brother"" is made gently comic thanks to Rudd's fool-on-the-hill vibe and a quirky and effervescent supporting cast."
"While it's no Raging Bull, it is fun, if you're willing to roll with the punches."

My favorite moment involves a Jar-Jar Binks tattoo -- and whether or not that idea strikes you as funny should be a pretty good indicator of whether or not you'll like Fanboys.
"10 Prisoners feels like a near-modern-masterpiece, with both Alexandre Moratto and Christian Malheiros cementing themselves as two of the strongest voices working in film today."
"The performances by Courtenay and Rampling are excellent. They look and act the part of an old married couple, used to each other's habits and quirks. This is an effective drama about a gathering storm in an old relationship."
"Provides Humor & Heart, But It's No Marvel"
"Like the best movies often do, ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" leaves audiences with a complex set of emotions, and with a hard-to-define hint of the profound."
"""Captain America: Civil War"" is a much better version of ""Batman v Superman."" Not only does the film juggle a dozen major superheroes pretty seamlessly, but it manages to tell a cohesive story without making the film feel too stuffed."
"Leave No Trace speaks, not just to the trauma and the damage of soldiers who have seen too much in war, but wider questions of endurance and the soul that can touch all of us."

Nighthawks is a compelling movie with plenty of adrenaline-pumping chase sequences.
"An up close and personal biographical study of the activist and longstanding public servant, as well as a compelling examination of the history of the Civil Rights movement, through Lewis' vital role in it."
A fabulously well-crafted motion-picture. (...) as close to being in the bunker oneself as one can get.
"Probably one for those already enamoured with its creator, though there are numerous fascinating threads to untangle from this baroque tapestry if one has the patience."
"An acidic, anarchic layer cake of mental illness with comedy teddy bear Seth Rogen as its seal of approval. It'll be fascinating to see how this demented, treehouse feature is received by audiences accustomed to far bouncier takes on smutty giggles."
"None are as watchable as the pretty, prancing, plotting, primal Weaving, who also helps deliver some of the dark humor she teams with to save this predictable, but engaging enough summer horror silliness."

"A wonderful family achievement, not overwrought or too sentimental, but a powerful example of the contemporary immigrant and American experience."
"The situation delivers less wackiness than it promises, and there aren't a lot of big laughs. Charm fills the void, though."
"Yeah, 'Captain America: Civil War' is true to its frenetic form as revved up entertainment preparing moviegoers for the upcoming summertime sizzle at the box office. After all, the on-screen Marvel Comics gravy train keeps moving merrily along"
A first-class thriller and thought-provoking morality play.
"Apart from a contrived ending, Jindabyne comes as close as can be to a perfect drama."
"The Hunt works as simplistic, cathartic melodrama. It's about ambiguity, but there's nothing ambiguous about the film itself."
"For a script that relies more on character-driven than situational comedy, it's the perfs that count, and these are thankfully strong."
...Black Panther is one of the best Marvel films ever.
"""Hereditary"" is haunting in stretches, but Aster doesn't know when to quit, threatening to ruin a good thing with needless overkill."
"The film was clearly a passion project for Winter and Reeves, and there's something joyous about watching them reprise the roles that helped jumpstart their careers -- especially when it feels more like a labor of love than a disingenuous cash grab."
"By the time the credits roll, Landis has given us the goods, but more importantly, he's given us a good story."
"It's heavy subject matter, but the film is remarkably light on its feet. Budreau matches Baker's creative ingenuity, turning the cliched events of his subject's life into a bracingly original story"
It's an art movie for the masses.
"Frank Capra's most ambitious and disturbing film, Meet John Doe is possibly more relevant today than when it first appeared in 1941."
"Thankfully for all of us, Schumer continues to lean in."
"Rouan's writing, as far as can be judged from subtitles, is pointed and vital. Her performance is superb."
I don't know why Hong's films are much more attractive to me than Noah Baumbachs. Haewon and many of Hong's films ring true to me in portraying human relationships.

An engaging (if overlong) romantic comedy...

One of the greatest films I've ever seen.
"Reviewing a Coen Brothers film is usually an exercise in inventively arranging superlatives, and  True Grit definitely doesn't break from the mould."
The third film manages to remember what the second film forgot about the first film: be fun.
"While there's stunning scenery in the movie, it's mostly a backdrop to a narrative that's more about spirit than spectacle. In this case, the subject of the film is something that can't be captured on any size screen."
Hereditary is so scary relatives five generations back will be able to sense your fear.
"There are a few incredibly great laughs, and believe it or not, it's the most ""fun"" of the slasher horror films there's been in the 10 movies."
"The chases and fight scenes are fun, if repetitive, and each member of the diverse and affable cast gets a little bit of business to do... But F9's attempts at classical drama, all its reckoning with dynastic sin, do weigh the thing down quite a bit."
"Such a personal take is necessarily also partial. There's no Pete Doherty here, nothing from her last boyfriend, no one from the music industry... There are touching glimpses into the afterlife of a shortlived talent"
Brett Morgen makes some odd choices&#46; But on the whole&#44; this is an immersion into the quintessence of Bowie&#46;  An intoxicating portrait of the artist as a constantly morphing young man&#44; middle-aged man and man facing death before his time&#46;
Brutal class realities in contemporary Iran
A thorny and intricate film that is also breathtakingly simple and honest.
"It is an evocative time capsule, but Many Saints does not depict the formative experiences of its ostensible subject, Tony Soprano."
It's the Backyard Acting Olympics.
"So, here's the scoop: Though nowhere near as masterful as last year's Match Point or the Allen classic comedies of the '70s and '80s, Scoop is modest, late-summer fun."
"A masterwork of symbolic cinema; it depicts, with vast imagination, the ordeals faced by women in modern Iranian society."
"A simple, somewhat creaky tribute to defiant courageousness."
"""Pain and Glory"" can be achingly sad, but its pleasures, rainbow hues and humor keep it (and you) aloft."
In a word: Flawless. First Man is a stunning film where everything works in symphony.

"an ingeniously plotted and witty reflex on the horror genre itself, as well as its voyeuristic audience and its cathartic function."
"Few movies grab the lonely, lost and timeless suck of freshman year at college as well as ""Sh*thouse."""
The acting and writing are so solid that the grifters and con artists who populate this film are simultaneously appalling and appealing&#46;&#46;&#46;
With its cast of oddballs and dilapidated urbanity&#44; &quot;Funny Pages&quot; speaks not just about a past era of cartooning but an earlier of trend of films inspired by it&#46;

"The talent of the director consists in exploring, with discretion and without a hint of moralism, the complexity of this psychological trance. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"There are definitely some pacing problems-and a muddled message about centrism that could've been elaborated on or dropped-but if the ultimate intention of a romcom is to make you both laugh and swoon, then Long Shot is right on target."
"Duplicates many of the strengths of the original, without surpassing or even matching its originality and inspiration"
A fascinating introduction to one of France's major filmmakers.

It's rare a movie as singularly uplifting as Wild Rose comes along.
Midnight Run touches on one of the great mysteries of the movies: How is it that the tritest material can come to life when touched by the right director and the right actors?
There&#8217;s a feverish anticipation of who&apos;s going to crack first under the delicate circumstances&#44; but all ended up lukewarm&#44; with limited novelty&#46;
A flawed but funny and heartfelt film that suggests: maybe you can go home again-even if that means coming back to Jersey.
"This Ant-Man is clever enough to be fun, and wise enough not overstay its welcome. Who better understands the benefits, after all, of keeping it small?"
An electric display of activism and vitality in the face of death. [Full review in Spanish]

... the classic chick flick story long before any flick found the word chick.
[Emma Watson] has already shown that she can play other dramatic roles besides Hermione Granger... [Full review in Spanish]

"Herzog's film may not be the final word on Gorbachev, but it is affectionate and candid and leaves audiences in a melancholy mood about the sometimes short-lived nature of reform."
"Peter Dinklage details Fin's solitude in single glances, but his countenance also warms to eventual friendship. It's an attenuated, reserved, realistic performance - bolstered when we learn Fin is silent because shouting only summons repressed rage."
The two-hour runtime flies by as the Coens shame bloated blockbusters with sheer craft.
"[The Glorias] contains some extraordinary subjects, and Taymor dramatizes them with stellar historical elements and colorful character dynamics."

...a good film with some great moments and two excellent lead performances...

The baroque blast of stylized design&#44; gothic hysteria and black humor teases&#44; terrifies&#44; and raises the drama to operatic levels&#46;
"Although it's quite long at 2 1/2 hours, Prisoners holds interest and tension thanks to the strength of the screenplay and craftsmanship of the cast and crew. Be warned: you will not want to take a bathroom break during the film, so go before"
"Gunpowder Milkshake still has its moments of fun, but the whole bloody affair is just missing a heart and a bit of soul."
"This is no doubt the first of many movies that will struggle to tell the stories of a war that's far from over, and even if the tale is imperfectly told, it commands our attention."
"""We Live in Public"" is a cautionary look at how surveillance affects individuals. Far from the Wim Wenders's ""End of Violence"" premise, it could signify the end of the world as we know it."
"With his physical stature and moral gravitas, the gifted Liam Neeson elevates Carnahan's survival thriller way above its familiar elements of man vs. nasty nature and cruel wolves."
"Exhausting and exhilarating, it's an inspirational saga."
"Mitchell reshapes tried-and-true scare conventions - teens in peril, a relentless malevolent force, jarring soundtrack - into an unexpectedly unique creepfest. And his riffs on sex and adulthood are refreshing in their allegorical complexity."

an intriguing existential space oddity
"... Palmer -- and J.J. Villarreal, as her unflappable fellow contestant and first-blush romantic interest -- makes it all go down very easily."
"But while the film sometimes feels busy and scattered, Janney and Robbie are vivid anchors, diving into the kind of complicated, boundary-pushing characters that, let's face it, are usually the domain of men onscreen."
...the film would've been vastly improved had it been trimmed down to 90 minutes.
"It's a beautiful, melancholy film, and makes you begin to wonder if Karl Marx didn't have a point."
"This enigmatic, poetic film, co-directed by brothers Ramon and Silvan Zürcher, instils intimations of the cosmic into a deliberately ordinary narrative frame."
"2017's best feature film...a masterpiece, an emotionally affecting epic. Campillo saves his most provocative moment for last, an astounding depiction of love, death and the fight for life."

Ly is a deft orchestrator of story - and chaos.
A messed-up way to spend Mother's Day

"As a work of fiction, Stillwater feels near-masterpiece level with Tom McCarthy, Matt Damon and Abigail Breslin giving possibly the best performances of their careers. The movie, however, is undeniably tied to a real-life tragedy and feels manipulative"
Wolfe retains a lot of Wilson's play's theatricality in this cinematic rendition and it's all to its immense strength. Davis and especially Boseman are on a whole other level.
The working title was Ship of Fools but should have been Abbott and Costello Take Some Speed.

"Despite a tricky, intellectualising premise complete with god-like figure who calls the shots, this strange, gloomy and beautiful sci-fi drama is engaging and impressive"
"It's compelling in many ways, but ultimately not 100% satisfying."
"Exarchopoulos proves to be an actress of interior strength, aching vulnerability and searing sensuality as the central figure in Abdellatif Kechiche's self-discovery classic."
Hopefully this is a movie that will make a difference and cut through the noise.

It&#8217;s hard to believe it&#8217;s half a century since Cabaret first sashayed into cinemas&#58; in look&#44; sound and sensibility&#44; it still feels fresh and daring&#44; expanding the possibilities of what musicals can do and say at every turn&#46; 
The plot has the standard ups and downs but an always-likable cast keeps us rooting for Scott and Leslie to realize that they are just right.
"What I love about del Toro's Nightmare Alley is that it feels like his love letter to a bygone era in Hollywood, as well as a gorgeously haunting cautionary tale as old as time with incredible performances from both Bradley Cooper and Cate Blanchett."
"It's the joy of watching Chan, a Buster Keaton of kickboxing, hurling himself into every stunt with total commitment, astounding athleticism and oddly unflappable, shaggy-haired grace."
Horror fans will love the way it delivers on the genre with some inventive artistic flourish.
"One of art's richest rewards is its way of teaching us about our assumptions, doubts, and capacity for faith. ... My Kid Could Paint That gets people thinking and talking."

"Clever animated superhero story is fun, not too scary."
"Although they're separated by some 40 years in age, Owen and Lieberher are very similar actors. They have an unforced and intimate rapport together that fits Nelson's eloquent, no-nonsense writing and direction."
The movie is clearly intriguing in ways it may not have intended.
"It's rare that a movie that is concerned with issues currently in the headlines is more than that, but Aki Kaurismaki's touching and funny The Other Side of Hope, which focuses on the migrant crisis in Europe, pulls it off."
The Help has so much heart it's easy to feel both sorrow and enjoyment while watching such an emotional film.
Julie & Julia is a delectable cinematic concoction about two food-loving women.
"Tatum, as expected, brings depth and detail to a less than nuanced part, and the three Belgian Malinoises playing Lulu are gorgeous and, thankfully, not anthropomorphized with too many cutesy reaction shots."
The film's heart is Magdiel and the modest dreams that get him through the day but may also be the death of him.
The story twists beautifully and shockingly. The ending is brilliant. Skillfully directed by Jordan Scott.
"In short, this isn't a bad film, and it's probably worth seeing for Lady Gaga alone, but also it's not a great one."
"The Eyes of My Mother is effective and unsettling, and as a first movie from Pesce, promises much more in the future."
"How do we keep our wits about is when all that is left behind for us is chaos, confusion and fear? ( ... ) it is generational trauma that is the Big Bad for a new generation."

Doubles down on the things that made the first film a hit
Magicians and movies need skill and flourish to enrapture their audience. Sleight gets by with only one of those ingredients. It could have been a showstopper with both.

The new film hints mischievously at the kind of dysfunction that would truly bring the Brady bunch up to date.
Wild Rose is as wily as its titular character. This tale of a Glasgow born country (not country-western) singer and ex-convict can't help but have a bit of an unexpected edge.
"Like a Disney family drama from TV times past, this feelgood road movie is so homely, so warm and fuzzy, and so darn wholesome that it's almost too much."
"a trailblazing firecracker...and monotony be damned, I hope it becomes a franchise"
"Though [it] suggests a classic-Hollywood throwback, this story thankfully feels fresh and original."

Seagal goes back to a formula that works.

Meditative cinema.

This gripping (or nauseating) film has power beyond its ideas.
A very frank and gritty story about two brothers.
"""The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby: Them"" is worth seeing, if only for the way the camera lingers on Jessica Chastain as if she's a silken magnet."
"Storks is at times cacophonous and overly busy, and the animation tends toward the goofy rather than the spectacular. However, Stoller manages to pull off a third act and emotional resolution that's genuinely moving."
The filmmakers celebrate his prodigious achievements but the sadness is that he never managed to escape the hothouse world of the fashion industry.
"But the power of Titanic didn't come from originality; it came from punching cliches across with a seldom-seen directness and sincerity that seemed pure of heart, ""old-fashioned,"" or plain corny, depending on your perspective."
With an A-list cast happily playing against type&#44; a nonlinear storytelling approach&#44; witty dialogue and a plethora of creative violence&#44; Bullet Train plays out like an immensely satisfying upgrade of prime Tarantino&#46;

Three generations of women struggle to survive in an inhospitable wilderness in Brazil far from civilization.
"A dizzyingly attractive film that breaks down Noam Chomsky's ideas, filters them through Michel Gondry's unique way of seeing, and in the process breaks down the differences between art, science and philosophy"
In the end this thriller functions to makes us feel uncomfortable. [Full review in Spanish]
A genial and glossy middle-brow rom/com blended together with corny Capra-like political drama.
Dench makes mincemeat of the often pedantic material.
"2024 has been a big year for musicals. In performance, script and look, Cyrano is the best of the bunch."
"Akin makes this a most intriguing, if roundabout, journey from despair to 'do something.'"
"Effective as it all is - even with an over-reliance on jump scares - ""The Purge: Election Year"" is, like the rest of the films in a series, an ugly one, reliant on scenes of sadism and depravity."
"At the film's core is the question, what if some love is based not on love but in a dichotomy of horrific power and desire?"
Repulsive but mesmerizing.
We see the seeds of something special here; Palmer cements herself here as one to watch in the years to come.
"It manages to infuse its simple narrative with a spicily subversive attitude toward traditional gender roles, while spooning its audience generous helpings of sweetly seductive costume romance."
"""Catching Fire"" is more substantial than the first feature because it delves deeper into themes such as loyalty, love, honor, sacrifice and freedom"

"Chan puts his heart and soul into the part of Big Soldier, and it's a reminder that there is more to the actor than Hollywood cinemagoers may have witnessed."
Elephant invites scrutiny but defies explanation.
Sidney Lumet returns to the sort of form he showed in his heyday. It helps that we're on Lumet's favourite territory -- the heist gone wrong.
"All that's missing is the spirit and the anarchic humor of the sitcom created by Mel Brooks and Buck Henry. The result is an overdressed, carefully stitched scarecrow of a comedy."
The first part of The Phantom could almost be a summation to the jury by the prosecution.
Paul Green is like the crazy uncle that your kids love to be around even if he makes them cry.
"For the most part this is an entertaining, and old-fashioned feeling film."
Breaking the rules has never seemed so fun . . . or so necessary.

"Along with The Postman segment from Satyajit Ray's Two Daughters, it is, I think, the greatest short film ever made."
"Lohman adapts to the changes required of her, but the actress and director Peter Kosminsky never get the audience to break through the wall her character erects"
"Precious captures how a lost girl rouses herself from the dead, and Daniels shows unflinching courage as a filmmaker by going this deep into the pathologies that may still linger in the closets of some impoverished inner-city lives."
"Sayles' prolix narrative, weighed down with subplots and characters and canvassing many social ills, dilutes the impact of a work that should nevertheless still make an impact on thoughtful viewers."
His latest offering is as vibrant as any he has produced.
Reno himself can take credit for most of the movie's success. He's one of the few 'cool' actors who never seems aware of his own coolness.
"There may be much that is familiar, but with this version Wright nevertheless manages to be both reverent and innovative, with more than a dash of ... panache."
"A well-crafted tearjerker with a grown-up performance from Zac Efron. If you don't mind risking dehydration, it's the movie for you."
The deliriously demented 1960s Japanese show 'Johnny Sokko and His Flying Robot' proves to be a stronger influence on 'Pacific Rim' than any Godzilla movie.
... A suspense masterpiece ...
"""Happy being weird, at least giving the film some character when the storyline is too poorly executed to pick up the slack."""
"Weitz's rousing satire is no dream: It's the mad, mad real world of America in the year 2006."
"On the surface a literate werewolf thriller, the subtext of Mike Nichols' Wolf is a sharp critique about what it takes to succeed in the cutthroat corporate world."
"Efficient and highly effective in its style, relying on sound, creepy production design, and the men's own fear and misjudgment to create the sense of pervasive doom."
"Yesterday fulfills its modest ambitions with warmth and gentle humor. It wouldn't, however, make any impact if it were magically erased from existence."
"This beautiful 2K restoration...features the original intertitles while simulating the color tinting and toning of the original not seen since the 1920's...Unveiled at the 2016 Berlin Film Festival, Kino Lorber's release is a real treat for cinephiles."
The wonders never stop.
"As Michele, Huppert contains literal volumes."
"Rewarding, but ridiculously stingy in handing out simple details -- relationships, geographical settings, etc. -- vital to our grasp of what's going on."
"It's hard not to love these confident, capable, problem-free post-millennials."
An intriguing if rather run-of-the-mill feature debut for writer-director Yannick Saillet.
"A well made, atmospheric British thriller with terrific performances from a superb cast, though it's a little undermined by some casting issues and the script falters towards the end."
I will probably get a few digs from my friends for insisting that Ford v. Ferrari is not only entertaining but also smart.
"For those seeking a wickedly dark little confection, Thoroughbreds should prove a diverting watch; but those looking for anything deeper will find a lot left to be desired."
"Pushes the idea of the capricious monarch through the far reaches of comedy and almost into tragedy. Colman embodies sublimely the punch-drunk confusion of a woman unsure whether she's child or adult, plaything or puppet-master."
"The sort of romance that doesn't come around too often&#151;intelligent without being saccharine, heartfelt without being condescending."
If you've seen 'You Can Count on Me' you have a pretty good idea where 'The Skeleton Twins' is headed in its somewhat didactic approach to celebrating the unbreakable bonds siblings share. Yet you admire it just the same.
"This rip-roaring slice of sci-fi excess remains Arnold Schwarzenegger's most satisfying film since his breakthrough hit, The Terminator."
"Landon is focused on delivering a wild ride that holds together surprisingly well, despite the increased narrative complication."
"Heloise and Marianne, and the way their ardor is allowed to slowly unfold onscreen is both heartwarming and, given the dismal prospects for a future together, heartbreaking."
"This is a sadistic film, so be warned."
It&#8217;s an appealing film&#44; but not one that goes beyond what most viewers will be expecting&#46;
Bong Joon-ho does an exemplary job balancing a mystery with both humorous and dramatic elements.
Has a few scares up its sleeve ...
"If you're able to give yourself over to it, there's a quiet brutality to this tale of dogmatic obsession, shot and performed with simmering intensity as it is."
"Anxiety inducing imagery aside, I already want to watch this flick again."
"Set in the ruthlessly competitive ballet world, Black Swan is a trashy melodrama with a glossy artsy treatment, but it's gripping due to its speed and Natalie Portman's Oscar-caliber performance."
"As remakes go, Disney's latest might just be their best one yet, soaring to such stratospheric heights I almost can't help but be amazed."
"It's quaint, a little rustic but magical in its own way."
Ant-Man is great; an optimistic jaunt with plenty of cleverness and oodles of joy. Yet another feather in Marvel Studio's increasingly peacocked cap.
As we all know&#44; leaky containers can result in zombies&#44; as in The Return of the Living Dead&#44; homicidal maniacs&#44; as in The Crazies&#44; or a mind leech&#44; as in Mind Leech&#46;
"It's not quite a Hamilton movie, but it'll still blow you all away."
"As much of a pleasure as it is to watch Washington, Davis and Henderson interact, the film loses steam as it enters the final third."
"in Mr. Saturday Night, Billy Crystal nimbly makes the big leap from amiable (if sometimes irritating) funny man to serious, but not-too-serious filmmaker."
Its blend of speed and music makes 'Baby Driver' one of the year's best films.
"Talladega Nights is as good as a summer comedy about NASCAR has any right to be, with fine actors tucked into every nook and cranny."
"It has a light, shaggy charm, and De Niro is at his most winningly comical."
The Pianist is Polanski's best film.
"...the movie remains watchable even through the sporadic lulls within the narrative, something that's due almost entirely to Gervais' almost ridiculously entertaining performance."
"Maybe, the story spends too much time preaching, but Mascaro holds tight to his credo, aiming at the Brazilian conservatism with irony."
VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN is an enjoyable - if more than a bit silly - take on the classic story.
"[A] rich, fun and fascinating film experience."
"Senna feels a touch too short to be fully realized -- but then again, so was Ayrton Senna's life."
"It ... is worth watching for its crackerjack opening and the strength of its young cast, but mainly because of its inherent promise of (possibly) better things to come."
"I loved this, it's hilarious, heart warming and a little stroke of genius.."
"Shanghai Noon feels both like a flashback to an earlier time of more innocent pictures, and also slightly predictive of the vanguard of colourful comic-book cinema to come."
"Tully is worth a look for its true-to-life characters, its sensitive acting, its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer Hilary Birmingham."
traces the end of an era in muted colors and a somber mood sparked by dry humor&#8230; quiet gem of a film
"A Miracle of Miracles examines both the development of the much loved ""dark musical"" and its enduring popularity for audiences all around the world."
Syrup does nothing to challenge the stereotype but instead embraces it in an outlandish farce.
[Brown] collects some fascinating stories.
Zootopia excels on so many levels that it stands with the finest of the Disney classics.
"The ending is rather predictable, but the rest of the film is very skillfully wrought, with excellent performances by adults and children alike."
Sentiment is explained by science as the family impulse that motivates so many Steven Spielberg stories is revealed to be an evolutionary imperative in this near-perfect action-adventure.
"Ducournau eschews jump scares and instead focuses on tone, never allowing the audience to fully relax by peppering even what appear to be quotidian transition scenes with little reminders of the macabre."
Both archival footage of her remarkable flamenco and current interviews in which she speaks about rhythm entering the body reveal a natural artist who was born to dance.
"This last half of Lloyd's latest may not have a soothing effect upon people afflicted with nervous disorders... there are genuine shocks in Safety Last, some that can only be described by seeing them."
...a somber and contemplative study of a disenfranchised British man's journey of self-discovery via the bodily functions of a female dog over a period of 14-years.
This might be the best film of 2008.
Great seeing this portrait of a conductor who has just done some amazing things with the kids and adult musicians hes worked with. 
"[Beirut] is definitely a step up, with a stronger cast, led by Jon Hamm and Rosamund Pike, and a more polished screenplay."
"It shouldn't come as a surprise that Cody wrote the script after having her own third child, or that this excellent ode to self-care ranks among her finest, most mature pieces of work."
has stood the test of time to remain as funny today as anything Hollywood is producing now.
"Villeneuve's Dune takes a bit of time to set up the necessary palace intrigue and family dynamics before finding its shape as a relentless, propulsive chase movie."
"With Flushed Away, Aardman [Animations] has moved away from a guy and his dog to a girl and her mouse, but they're almost just as fun."
"[VIDEO] You can't relive the heady days and nights of Manhattan's club scene, but you can soak up some of the flavor. You'll also get a crash course in the city's muscle of political corruption that seems to increase with every passing year."
"This film barely brushes up against the many, many issues it raises, but those conversations can be had in the lobby, after the pleasure of watching an underappreciated artist finally get her due."
"Proving why he's still an American classic, 83-year-old director Sidney Lumet turns in another brilliantly executed crime thriller"
"Yes, it's a crowd pleaser and you can count me in as very much part of the crowd."
"Equity has injected women protagonists into a genre traditionally dominated by men, charging the Wall Street thriller with a buzz of female energy."
"Feels like no other film that you've seen before. It's cerebral and lugubrious, yet simple as a fairy tale."
One of the best originals that the platform has produced. [Full review in Spanish]
"While everyone remembers this film about an autistic man as Dustin Hoffman's Oscar-winning triumph, it is equally Tom Cruise's."
"It's not entirely clear how much of Big Game is funny on purpose, but it hardly matters when the action is so slick and the dialogue so ripe."
"(Director David) Fincher and (screenwriter Steven) Zaillian have visualized a cold, dreary and ugly Sweden that draws you in against your better instincts"
"Unpredictable, richly crafted, and beautifully written, The Drop is like the best liquor from the top shelf: it goes down hard and harsh, but it hangs on and gets its hooks right into you."
Gray keeps his picture interesting with a handful of inspired action scenes
The Oscar-nominated Rear Window isn&apos;t just one of Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s best films but one of the greatest thrillers ever made&#46;
"Chris Peckover's Christmas horror comedy is a deft melding of ""Scream"" and ""Home Alone"" that takes a surprisingly nasty turn in its last act...he really excels in his direction of his young cast"
"Mathieu Kassovitz is making a determined challenge for the stylish French sci-fi thriller crown of Luc Besson with this highly effective, highly charged action movie, even though he has had to rather mangle the novel on which it is based"
"[I]ts daffy, otherworldly story, rehearsing but not rehashing Stillman's frankly reactionary instincts, resounds less for its charming gaggle of collegiate women than for its dramatization of self-deception and the despair of depression."
A riveting and quirky movie about the aftershocks of 9/11 in the lives of a group of people still in denial a year later.
This contradiction - an activist for social justice with a blue-blooded partner - is sadly never explored.
"A timeless story about how the whole world is a potential threat to women, and even the smallest interactions can be loaded with unbearable consequences."
"Such an accurate, humble and kind autopsy. [Full Review in Spanish]"
It's an achingly poignant meditation on passion and loneliness in oxygen-choked Kuala Lumpur.
"Great documentaries, of which this is one, need great subjects, and Mr. Honnold fills the bill; he's thoughtful, funny, articulate, self-reflective and fatalistic to a scary degree."
"Adheres to the dumb/smart approach of other classics such as Airplane! and The Naked Gun. Opens strong, gets a lot of funny jokes in and then loses steam heading into the finale, but a worthy early horror parody nonetheless"
"Will appeal mostly to those who love theater and relish the opportunity to see a production being built, scene by scene."
"The craftsmanship of ""A War"" is unimpeachable. Tight shots and jittery camera work give the film an immediate, intimate feel."
"Ayers's warmest film to date finds meaning and depth in its ""I love you, man"" exchanges and rarely goes too long without staging some daring detective work and videogame ultraviolence."
"More than a narrative, the film is a study in visual ways to convey the ""swimmy,"" unreal sensations of love at first sight."
"Detroit is a gut-punch of a movie, one that pulls you in to the ugliness lying beneath the American id."
A slick and stylish horror comedy which delivers on both fronts.
"The Iperess File is a thriller set in a recognisable London where espionage is a seedy business conducted, not by impregnable Bonds, but by men as scared and venal as anyone else."
"Writer-director Sofia Coppola has produced a small-scale movie that exalts old-fashioned movie-making qualities, yielding a refreshingly understated alternative to a sea of summer blockbusters."
"Kulig dazzles as the poised, fearless, unpredictable Zula. Like a little dynamite she's ready to light up any scene with the sheer force of her joy, rage or pain."
This is an inspirational film about perseverance.
"Solidly telling in its methodical truth, Green's film is unassumingly dazzling in its low-key observations. The Assistant is impressively potent without the overstated exclamation of acrimony."
Director Sollett adds a humanistic layer of insight and wisdom to the story that transcends teen-pic formulas.
One of the best films of the year-it salutes openness and respect for life as antidotes to the use of violence to deal with the uncertainty and insecurity of our times.
The final 20 minutes of the film prove once again that what you can't see is infinitely more frightening than what you can..leaves you goosey and tense.
Funny when it needs to be. I don't know what more you can ask from the third installment of a series that has gone further than anyone reasonably could have expected.
"Politics aside, Herzog uses a realistic tone to depict a high-energy capture and escape."
"Like most of Grisham's stories, the set-up is better than the wrap-up, but this is a cast that knows how to satisfy, even when the material doesn't."
...a perfectly watchable (yet undeniably overlong) entry in an almost remarkably consistent series...
"As the characters get more intimate, so too does the film, with McCormack and, especially, Thompson cutting through the film’s more mechanical execution to deliver rounded portraits of people yearning for human connection in a judgmental world."
"The film is effective even when didactic, and Munn is terrific."
"For Daniel Craig the world of Bond could not be more far away: if his East European accent wobbles at times to Liev Schreiber's more authentic vocal, he looks the part of a man who can both kill and care."
"Adam Brody keeps the unnamed protagonist distant, strangely blank, as if part of his problem is his lack of any real personality of his own, prompting him to parasitise the charismatic women he meets and try to substitute scandalous behaviour for depth."
May be the finest thriller/romance hybrid of the new century.
"Its vision is unique and harrowing, its song hits to the heart."
"...two terrific bad guys. Banderas and Zeta-Jones are sexy and funny. Even with too many ridiculous fights, this is a lot of fun."
"It's a story designed to play the heartstrings like a fiddle, extracting sighs and sobs from willing viewers with surgical precision."
"The only slipup is a forgivable one. Jackson continues to be reluctant to leave a world he has so magnificently created. At a little over three hours, King Kong is a bit of a bum-number."
"There are plenty of great things about American Honey, but when stretched out to an incomprehensibly epic length, it is hard to see it as anything other than wasted potential."
"The film has grace, rhythm and music for a while with the story of the young man who only yearns to escape the crime world to rebuild his life. [Full review in Spanish]"
"It's no Jaws, but The Shallows is still a viciously, violently fun wave to ride."
"Delivers a hell of a lot of thrills as an R-rated romp that's refreshingly standalone, not trying to set up any sequels."
"Boyle -- and maybe Sorkin, though the domineering Sorkinese makes it hard to surmise -- is doing something smarter, even outright subversive."
"There are times in Christopher Nolan's somnolent crime caper where you'll find yourself recognizing moments from your own subconscious on the screen, to a thrilling, frightening and ultimately inspiring effect."
Taylor-Joy and Cooke are top-notch.
"The movie evaporates in the mind, but Stewart and Eisenberg have real movie-star chemistry."
A terrific picture crouched in the centre of a blasted Icelandic winter.
That moment where we see Captain Marvel in her full glory punching holes through the sky letting the audience know every girl can fly&#63; That moment Captain Marvel absolutely delivers&#46;
"The contrast in the acting styles of Pacino, De Niro and Pesci are predictable, yet gripping in this mob drama. Director Martin Scorsese is in his element directing this finely tuned 3 and a half hour lavish production."
"With some cool superhero action, Megamind is mildly amusing for the most part, but it feels like it could have been much better."
"Here, with everything that he's ever cared about on the line, Hunt proves why he's summer's most valuable action hero."
"""Scream 4"" lacks the qualities that would make it a masterpiece, but it testifies to the cyclical nature of commercial storytelling in sharp, nearly timeless fashion."
"The premise is ridiculously simple - take out your phone and film family members as they chat - but when your family is as expressive and poetic as Panahi's, most of your job is done for you."
Peter Dinklage is excellent as the mob's chief lawyer.
"Surprisingly candid, comprehensive and, most of all, emotional expos of the wrestling business."
"Follows [Pekar's] journey with originality, humor and humanity"
"If a movie can be defined by the strength of its villain, Avengers Infinity War is a giant. Towering over the spectacle is Josh Brolin's evil despot Thanos, whose striking capture motion performance and physicality comes close to stealing the film."
Iron Man is an action sci-fi blockbuster extravaganza that provides cartoon thrills for thinking people. It's the best movie of its kind since the second Spider-Man movie four years ago.
"The director's affectionate warts-and-all portrait of his milieu and subculture is blistering, cogently capturing how England's early-'80s skinhead movement was driven less by blind racial intolerance than by intense socio-economic tensions."
"The movie is self-pity disguised as self-sacrifice (he'll do anything for his fans) but it's also, by any measure, often funny."
This is terrific film-making - enough to bring a rush of blood to the head.
"Whether you know it or not, kids, you've now got your own generation's Close Encounters of The Third Kind."
Athlete A raises a lot of questions about the USAG's practices.
"The Unborn is a culty midnight movie that, like far more such films than we tend to credit, has a brain whose synapses are constantly firing away just beneath all the gore."
"Cove is a stirring call to arms, providing the damning dolphin massacre argument forcefully and creatively. I can't say the film will change the world, but it certainly will make those trips to Sea World more awkward."
"Maguire's otherworldly coolness suits the observer drawn into a story he might prefer only to watch. DiCaprio is persuasive as the little boy lost impersonating a tough guy, and Mulligan finds ways to express Daisy's magnetism and weakness."
"""The Day after Tomorrow is junk, but it's not a rip-off. Emmerich sincerely wants to entertain you, which is more than you can say for most of his Hollywood peers."""
"Kumail Nanjani and Issa Rae's chemistry and ease of dialogue make The Lovebirds feel like a throwback to corny, yet entertains Golden-Age rom coms. Unicorn suits, milkshake monologues and ride share jokes are worth the ride."

Odd feminist fun.

"Whether or not certain events played out precisely as we're told, the urgency of Polsky's cautionary message is inarguable."
A rapturously seductive slow burn watch.

"Oscillating between mild humor and navel-gazing pretension, Brad's Status is a road movie about fathers and sons that sporadically lands when it stops taking everything so seriously."
"Fantastic fun, though with so many superheroes jostling for position it's hard to delve deep even in 2.5 hours. There are plenty of jokes, some hilarious, some endearingly clunky. Brolin imbues Thanos with remarkable depth."

"The sci-fi stuff is tedious, but Wiig and Mumolo are bawdy and brilliant as ever, their effortless chemistry bolstered by years of collaboration."

An overlong but fascinating look at the life of a forgotten innovator of early rock'n roll

Samson and Delilah is impossible to ignore.
"The characters are drawn in broad strokes... Yet with Ryoo giving the action a Spielbergian sweep as the action builds towards the climactic prison break, you'll find yourselves rooting for them all the same."

"Doomsaying about independent films... is this year's favorite kvetch, and yet movie hand grenades still manage to get tossed into our laps with astonishing regularity. Lynne Stopkewich's Kissed is a startling example."
A slick and suspenseful landing until it fails to stick the landing.
There's lots of interesting stuff to chew on...it's never less than compelling.

"Refn is definitely a provocateur, but those audiences who enjoy being provoked should probably decide if they love it or hate it for themselves. We'll both be right."
"As good as the first two films were, as well as they redefined the action espionage thriller, the third film falls victim to its own innovation."

...a wonderful time warp movie with pace and style.

Hood knows how to crank the tension and a certain fury ticks under the story.

Sean Penn does a great job.
"Equal parts sultry, humorous, and heartbreaking, Hustlers brings a needed female perspective to an industry poorly portrayed by Hollywood. Constance Wu and Jennifer Lopez are a lock for Oscar nominations."

"Leave No Trace is a slow burn, and carefully constructed; the performances are measured and calm. There's no need to overplay the drama - the circumstances presented here are serious enough as they are."
"One of the great crime thrillers, the benchmark all succeeding heist films have been measured against, it's no musty museum piece but a driving, compelling piece of work, redolent of the air of human frailty and fatalistic doom."
"It's certainly a Spike Lee film, but no Spike Lee Joint. Still, he's delivered a pacy, vigorous and frequently masterful take on a well-worn genre."
Jeong sensitively gives her film an underlying sadness as the young women cope with the changes in their lives
"Darkly dazzling but, because of intense, sometimes terrifying imagery, it should be PG-13, not PG."
"Had this historical drama really relied on the strength of its convictions, George Clooney's good old fashioned movie might have flowed better."
A deliciously bitter pill from the Coen brothers
"Michael Apted's 'self defense isn't murder' thriller may reek of familiarity like yesterday's garbage, but the intense chemistry between the leading actors actually makes the film work."
"Mary Poppins Returns is at its best when it gives way to the unbridled, and unselfconscious sincerity that a tale like this demands."
Its ability to take audiences to a completely different land and time may remind them of how they felt when they saw Star Wars or The Wizard of Oz for the first time.
"Smart, sardonic and more than a little silly, Iron Man is a successful super-hero movie that never takes itself too seriously."
"Blowin Up is ultimately a film more about the need for a better system than a perfect solution. But with its generous, devoted attention to the people working on that solution, it is a work full of hope."

We shouldn't underestimate the opportunity the film faces: to be a feminist rescue mission.
"Everything about ""At the Heart of Gold: Inside the USA Gymnastics Scandal"" suggests someone coming toward you with a spoonful of particularly ghastly medicine. But the benefits outweigh the few unsavory side effects of this largely first-rate documentary."
"Broly sets up what could be the next phase of this Super era. If you've ever in your life loved anime and especially if you've watched Dragon Ball, go see this movie while it's in theaters and enjoy yourself as much as Goku enjoys fighting."
It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
"The special effects are more of the psychological nature, with nothing evil shown clearly but its presence always pervading."
"Anchored by Owen and Kidman, and delivered with a larger than expected scope by Kaufman... Hemingway & Gellhorn may not be literary, but it's a satisfying accomplishment."
"The Original Kings of Comedy is all about truth -- about love, family, work and life."
Suitably giddy with its horror-movie platitudes aimed at mocking the facade of suburban hysteria...this thriller thrives with the right amount of scrappy charm and intrigue.
"When more film lovers discover the visual beauty of this film and continue to be haunted by its imagery, Majidi's films will surely receive more screenings in the states"
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is exactly what you'd expect from Guy Ritchie: a frenetically paced affair peppered with humour and plenty of laddish behaviour.
"As sober as a lab report, the excellent documentary metes out its findings with calm precision."
Hair High is the actually the artist's most cohesive 'story' to date...which means it's only about 35% weirder than any other sort of animation out there.
"This blue-collar ""Ocean's Eleven"" is a smooth-running, pleasantly familiar crime caper. In a movie full of cons, the greatest may be how deceptively easy Steven Soderbergh makes the whole enterprise seem."
"...basically just sits there for a good long hour before it picks up any sensible speed. Is it all worth it, though? In ways."
[An] interesting exercise in style. [Full review in Spanish]
"The contrast between two very different characters who get along so well, is what makes ""Cha Cha Real Smooth"" an extremely charming experience. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Finds Soderbergh keeping it simple, stupid, by filling the story's hollowness with kick-butt action and elements of style."
"The script's snazzy dialogue establishes a realistic atmosphere that involves us in the unfolding crisis, but the lazy plotting ensures that little of our emotional investment pays off."
"Throughout Paolo Sorrentino's film, the line between miracle and cosmic prank, even tragedy, is rendered indistinguishable."
A documentary that mixes advocacy journalism with the suspenseful thrill of a caper.
More than anything&#44; this documentary is a celebration of Blades the Musician&#46; His talent and contribution to the genre of salsa cannot be underestimated&#46;
"Right now, this gleefully reckless adult comedy gets the job done in ways many new-release movies this year have failed to do."
"They call documentary which is actually a propaganda piece, never trying to question Walter's figure but rather falling all over his mysticism, for which I honestly can't blame them either. [Full review in Spanish]"
Nothing about this film feels remotely safe.
"Unlikely premise, yet script offers dialogue, heart-tugs, actual intelligent thought and a fair and necessary reflection on the State elections in the Union. A pleasant film."
"Cooper is superb, hard as granite, dense as an imploding black hole."
"Overall it's smart entertainment that even manages to make Robert De Niro, Cooper's co-star, sound fully engaged."
"Chris Sanders and Dean Deblois have crafted such a smart and sassy tale, it would have been solid even if the central characters were stick figures."

"Regardless of whether you recognize the names of Christopher Isherwood or Don Bachardy, this masterful documentary draws you into the men's lives like a star-studded bedtime tale."
"While Caught won't abduct everyone's attention, it's a strange, unique, and intense indie that will be welcomed by both sci-fi and horror fans alike."
"Take it for what it is: An old guy who gives himself one last juicy role as the flawed, haunted anti-hero, an old guy who's done this so often that he isn't above making himself look silly as well as heroic (he even croons the title song over the ending c"
"It's a slow effort, painfully so at times, but the reward is a sharp psychological study that ends up being the most interesting conflict in the movie."
Boogie Nights for Gen Z...
"Parts of the film are frustrating, and downright suspenseful, because Marija earns our respect while no one else gives her any. Thanks to Jaktait&#279;'s bracing performance, we know she also internalizes this hard-earned truth."
"Very violent, mostly in comic-book terms."
The cast ... manages to give thoughtful performances that salvage the film's integrity.
"The Fly seizes on our ingrained, instinctive horror of sexuality, the sense of shame that our fundamentally puritanical society can't help but teach us, and by confirming our worst fears, helps us, for a moment, to move beyond them."
"Ghosts of the Ozarks is not groundbreaking or ushering a new kind of terror, but it does have an impressive premise, worthy of appreciation in the wealth of knowledge of the genre, making it an independent horror film worthy enough to seek out."
"Melissa McCarthy gives the performance of her career and Richard E. Grant is terrific. Director Marielle Heller has a keen eye for detail from the bookshops to the bars, the film is bathed in authenticity."
"Although imperfect, it's engaging, thought-provoking stuff."
"The lean story-telling works well for its taciturn characters and spare settings, presented by cinematographer Amundsen, and well scored with assistance from Mastodon."
The Forever Purge is another powerfully political piece of action horror art from the hit franchise&#44; drawing on our current social strife for its scares&#46;
"All the participants are earnest, some a bit quirky, but Stephenson allows us to judge them for ourselves as this amusing, low-key suspense yarn unfolds"
The strong conclusion ensures that the film ends on a somewhat powerful note...
A classic gets even better.
"In some ways, Coppola improves on the original film, but at the very least the different actors make for a different dynamic."
"Room 237 is a fascinating study of what fans of the film believe, and it's an entertaining look at that world-especially if you're not immersed it in it everyday."
"It's hard to resist a satire, even when it wobbles, that insists the most unbelievable parts are the most true."
Close to an XL for me. It's a sequel that uses a rehash of storylines and characters that still actually held up.
"I'd rank being stuck in a big quiet house at night as one of life's most easily unnerving experiences, and this movie capitalizes on it."
No franchise like Scream has to constantly reinvent itself with meta narratives while also keeping direct connections to its original installments&#46; Scream VI is a mean&#44; nasty&#44; rollicking good time at the movies&#44; just as Wes Craven always intended&#46;
"It may not make total sense, but Déjà vu is a highly enjoyable, superbly made thriller. Like me, you may want to see it again"

"Despite these frustrating moments where The Witches of the Orient feels designed for a different audience, one which doesn't need to either race to catch up or be calmed into tranquility, the story of the Japanese volleyball team is undeniably remarkable."
"Captures a raw and honest look at the feeling of being trapped in a life you never asked for, wanting so desperately to get yourself out of it, but realizing that you're probably stuck there for good."
"A clever, enjoyable movie, with enough thrills and laughs to keep all ages entertained!"
"As freewheeling and irreverent as the man himself, Saint Misbehavin' is that rare documentary whose flaws seem appropriate for its subject matter."
a wickedly funny and stylish take on a childrens classic that conjures family fun with a typically dark Roald Dahl edge. 
"A collage of emotions, shifting through scenes that are happy, silly, angry, sexy, even sad."
I seriously love this movie.
"A naturalistic, chat-heavy narrative that captures the difficulties wrought by the unimaginable trauma individuals face as they attempt to forge connections and find peace after war."
"An increasingly rich and accomplished comic still works for his laughs, with edge, antic energy and polished stage patter."
"""Spider-Man: Far from Home"" isn't really a superhero movie. It's a wholesome teen comedy disguised as a superhero movie."
This all-too-familiar gloom and doom tale is depressing and feels longer than the 104-minute running time. The acting is top drawer from the powerhouse cast of respected thespians.
"Deftly written by Richard Curtis and directed by the versatile Mike Newell, Four Weddings is as good as its word, breezily following a small circle of friends through every one of the events the title promises."
There are still good vampire movies being made. Like this one.
"At its core, watchable."
The Second Coming on a trash heap.
A moving documentary for the ages and a reminder of Gilda Radner's greatness both as a comic and as a human being.
A story that tries and often succeeds in transcending its particulars for a story about the personal and political struggle to come of age.
"Between an elegant ""pas de deux"" and a simple, as well as painful, sprain. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Technically, Scott has consistently demonstrated that he ranks among the best popular film artists. Unfortunately, Scott's film doesn't work for me as well in other areas."
This place is less crossroads of the world than land of confusion.
"The impact of Peter Jackson's King Kong is as massive as the gigantic gorilla itself, a spectacle to marvel at, but most importantly, a story with which we can connect emotionally."
"The story, about a young soldier who is torn between leaving the army and loyalty to his brothers at arms, is affecting and well acted ..."
"The microcosm Delmer Daves creates here would make Billy Wilder pause, and the final five minutes are a masterstroke of nihilism."
Zombieland&#58; Double Tap is perfect for fans of the original&#44; especially in keeping its focus squarely on original characters but the film isn&apos;t perfect overall and it&apos;s hard to say it will pull in new fans&#46;
The scenery is beautiful and it is a fun ride along with Emily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson but it is no African Queen.
Probably the most visually dazzling film Pixar has ever made.
The irresistibly wicked humor of this film is firmly rooted in despair. We can all relate.
The movie somehow finds something new and meaningful to say about art and life and the region of shades between the two. 
"Plays out with frightening, gripping logic, each new step and new realization suddenly appearing like a cold sweat."
"A pastoral romance based on an earlier version of Lawrence's novel that is softer and can stand on its own terms, despite lacking the class distinctions that would distinguish the final version."
"When I think what sentimental tripe The Queen could have been in the hands of amateurs, I bow in gratitude to all concerned."
It takes only a glance at Julie Ledru&#44; the star of &#8220;Rodeo&#44;&#8221; to convince you to go for the ride of Lola Quiveron&#8217;s ferocious feature debut&#46;
"Though it never hits action movie nirvana, if you can get past the intentionally OTT gross-out factor, Repo Men is a serviceable and entertaining sci-fi yarn."
It may move you to tears -- you'll also bust a gut laughing at his dialogue-recording scenes from Aladdin and stage-show improvs -- but this important documentary about the last days of actor Robin Williams is must viewing.
"Wonder Woman ends with a sequel on the horizon, that will certainly get made if the movie inspires little girls to ditch their Disney Princess regalia and learn to scare off creeps with the raise of an eyebrow, the Gal Gadot way."
"It's a fascinating bundle of contradictions--authentic in a million details, deeply romanticized in others. Cool, calm and collected, this is more love story than gangster picture."
"It's a pleasure to see a movie about people in their 50s, assessing their lives as they deal with the long farewell of a parent."
"In its broad strokes, Glory gets at the spirit of a group of previously unsung black heroes, and the filmmaking is of a high caliber. [Blu-ray]"
"For journalists and people who care about democracy and the value of open society, Spotlight is a master class on how things should be done."
"It's pure-strain Bong all the way through, surprising and unsubtle in all his appealing glory."
"A slow-building, well-done, rather melancholic film, Mountain treats the life of an Orthodox Jewish woman, Tzvia, whose family lives in a dwelling adjacent to the Mount of Olives cemetery in Jerusalem."
"The film is a meticulously, perhaps even cynically crafted crowd-pleaser. Even those alive to its tactics might find themselves wiping away a tear or two."
"I can't say the found-footage format of Chronicle was particularly impressive, but the rest of the film is a minor revelation."
"By tying it back to characters that don't seem popped from any too-familiar mold, the film allows its sense of regret, its alarm at time passing, to feel earned."
"Black Widow isn't the best MCU movie. It's not really in the top tier, really. And it doesn't offer as many broader connections as we might like. But as far as popcorn-munching action-packed cinematic adventures go, you could do a lot worse."
"Though the subject matter could've been developed into a more challenging and provocative yarn, this film's chief aim is escapism."
Pollack does right to put his faith in one man and a whole lot of mountains. The result is impressive.

"This sprawling portrait of the Red Army Faction... is neither an apologetic for the anarchist gang nor a condemnation of it, but rather a fascinating exploration of the shift in the zeitgeist of that era..."

"A total celebration of theatre, history and politics."
"In this summer of raunchy, hilarious R-rated comedies, Virgin fits right in--even if the one-joke premise gets a little stale towards the end."
"A crime of cinematic passion, a daring attempt at replicating a famed artist's visionary style in animated form, and a somewhat plodding detective story told in wheezy old narrative tropes that violate an often ravishing technique."
"Deadwyler gives a career-making performance as Mamie, perfectly poised between grief and strength. The film, which is dedicated to Mamie, ultimately belongs to her."
"Martin Scorsese's dbut feature has just the slightest bit of story line, but the movie is a fascinating portfolio piece: a black-and-white blueprint for ""Mean Streets."""
Mostly enjoyable and only slightly too long.
A clever blend of psychological thrills and stalked-by-monster terror is what makes writer-director Neil Marshall's sophomore effort a cut above most horror films.
"MacIntyre and Chris Lee Hill's screenplay is rife with absurdity, glorious carnage, jet-black humor - and best of all, a solid relationship at its core."
"""Last Christmas"" is that film that fits neatly between spasms of holiday shopping, when you want to just get away from the mall madness for a couple of hours."

Romeo Must Die scores when it concentrates on Li's fast footwork and flying fists.
Sends chills down your spine.
"More daydream than nightmare, The Craft: Legacy delivers an enchanting outing that honors its origins while maintaining the ease and self-awareness characteristic of a timelessly great scary movie."
It's as hilarious as you can imagine. [Full Review in Spanish]

What's so lovely here is Manuel's warmth and humanity - the way he lives with regrets and disappointment.
The minute you hear the Downton Abbey theme it's like coming back home. Director Julian Fellowes out did himself with a marvelous transfer of the beloved series without skipping a beat on its essence. Maggie Smith's quick wit is absolutely fantabulous
"What's amazing is the mixture of willpower and uncertainty, mendacity and credulity, gracefulness and self-conscious posing that [DiCaprio] conveys, even before you see him speak."
"Paced with the deliberate restraint and discipline of a seasoned poker player, the film is clinical and unflinching in its execution, its impact incremental yet lingering."
"War is hell; Winter Soldier shows that this was true of the Vietnam War, only more so."

"Challenge all viewers and gives them plenty to ponder after the credits roll, the lights go out and they reach the parking lot."
"Manages to overcome the triple threat of a new director, being a prequel, and being the third film in a series. This really is a pretty terrific addition."
It&#8217;s a traditional sci-fi horror picture that doesn&#8217;t break new ground outside of its slick advertising trick&#46; But is it really trying to break new ground&#63; I would argue it&#8217;s trying to make a fun&#44; intriguing &#8220;Cloverfield&#8221; installment&#46;
"23rd Century Women is irreducible ... although certain adjectives and adverbs do leap to mind: generous, reflective, absolutely delightful."
A wild and wicked film that should make anyone think twice before grabbing that Egg McMuffin on the way to work or 'treating' their kids to a meal almost engineered to make them sick.
McDormand is incredible here and deserves the attention she's been getting. This film does shine a light on an important issue - I just wish it hadn't put quite such a positive spin on it.

I couldn't help but enjoy myself in the theater.
The the picture is more than a wink-fest -- it's often blazingly funny.
"A whole lot of movie, but it's also technically mature filmmaking to a thematically juvenile end."
"Paradise Now is an agonized inquiry into the minds of a dispossessed new generation of Palestinians, who come off more introspective and internally divided than you'd think."
The desperation for human connection in a place where no one belongs is palpable - and the willingness to humor anyone unusual is part of it.
"Paints a portrait of the women's moment of the 60s & 70s, writer/director Lissette Feliciano's creatively crafted film validates those times' struggles & heartbreak. Strong performance by Lorenza Izzo."
"A western that exudes beauty everywhere in a very well told story (like everything that A24 does). With a minimalist narrative, First Cow transmits a lot of peace and serenity. [Full review in Spanish]"

"Yet another long, meandering, talky French film may not be your first choice for escapist entertainment. But there's some terrific stuff in this one."
One of [Godard's] most entertaining movies is also one of his most timeless.
Hilariously outrageous action scenes and asinine dialogue ultimately overshadow the layers of political and social commentary.
"This scrappy little film is informed with a lot of truth about not only the Viagara-ridden porn business, but obsessional human behavior."
"""Keep An Eye Out"" is an uproariously funny film filled with slapstick humor, inventively quick-paced dialogue, and an off-kilter story with one surprise after another."

The conversations it provokes will probably be more enjoyable than the ones it depicts.

"...a non-stop, high tension thriller that doesn't let up until the end."
"It's often dirty, yes. But it's also manic and inspired."

... had Armstrong never been accused of doping would Gibney's film still have its original title?
The remarkable debut from writer-director Michelle Garza Cervera is as effectively blood-curdling as it is intellectually incisive.

It delivers more than its fair share of jump scares and knows when to bail out.
"There is much to admire here, but the sheer scope of the subject matter might be even better served by the capaciousness of a mini-series."

"The crazy-quilt quality of these immigrants mixing it up with Southern rednecks like William is deftly underplayed, and so it has more resonance for us."
"This groovy, green, not-so-mean movie kickoff to the Christmas season will delight children and remind grown-ups why Dr. Seuss still rocks."
Takes a provocative subject -- friendship and love between a Jew and a Muslim -- and makes it seem natural and wondrous.
"Hong [Sang-soo's] work can frustrate, but his observant cinema can also be revelatory, a reason he has such a strong international following."
"For a film that beautifully illustrates how one can find the music in their every day lives, ""Band Aid"" doesn't miss a beat, but it'll make your heart skip one."

"Beyond the Mat does what the wrestling game, with its manufactured personas, doesn't. It stays with the wrestlers until we start seeing them as people."

"Richard Linklater makes his best movie since “Boyhood” with “Apollo 10½: A Space Age Childhood,” a charming animated dramedy that combines the rotoscoped look of the director’s “Waking Life” with the “remember when” reveries of his “Dazed and Confused.”"

A solid summer blockbuster.

"There has been a lot of backlash by those accusing the boxer of lying, but that is not the point of this Tyson-Toback collaboration. It is Tyson's story, truth or not, from his viewpoint and that is what we get."

A film that never goes for the cheap scare and captures the essence of genre classics like The Exorcist or The Shining. [Full review in Spanish]

A gross-out comedy that makes its audience go 'awwww' as much as it goes 'ewwww.'
"Ducournau may have changed tack here, but it's another impressive, thought-provoking piece of work."

"With genius executive producer John Lasseter's stamp of approval on ""Finding Dory"", what's not to like?"
"Scream feels familiar, but it's unafraid of criticizing its existence while providing commentary on the new wave of horror and toxicity in fandom."

Plenty for fans to chew over and enjoy. Non-fans should steer well clear.

...Colette is a film that is appropriate for this new era following the start of the Times Up movement.

Any A- or B- list actress would jump at the chance to work with the [screenwriters].
"Although it brings nothing new to the con-artist fold, or even anything thrilling, ""Focus"" is a seductive enough rehash that benefits from the built-in pleasures of the trade."
"...one of the most entertaining, laugh-out-loud funny, and unexpectedly touching efforts to come around in quite some time..."
"Regardless of its flimsy emotional interior, Ricki is a worthy addition in this year's growing canon of strong female-centred films, and it would be wise to remember Streep's stunning performance come awards season."

Colin Farrell is a super freaky vampire.
"Thompson's performance is compulsively fun, the actor relishing the bone-dry put-downs of a memorably serrated character."

"Baumbach's approach to the challenge of representing marriage and divorce is to treat both as absurdities. His film, though heavy and at times heart-wrenching, leans heavily into comedy -- self-deprecating and humiliating at times, but no less funny."
a magnificent adaptation that honors the film noir classic while giving contemporary audiences a grittier and more nuanced look at William Lindsay Gresham's story.

"From the direction to the script to the production elements to the performances, ""Triple Frontier"" is a first-class ride."
"Director Dexter Fletcher paints Eddie's story in broad, bold strokes, never missing an opportunity to milk a suspenseful dramatic turn or go for the relatively easy laugh -- but it's a style well-suited to this wonderfully ridiculous story."
"It's bold, captivating cinema, with a soundtrack that threatens to never leave your head."
"In Nighy, the witty script leaps to life, in a tour-de-force of darkly downbeat comedic timing..."
"Seymour is intriguing, mainly because it brings together two uniquely talented artists -- Hawke and Bernstein -- and captures them in thought and ocasionally in conversation, sometimes together but more often on their own."

"Asking audiences to sympathize with Fox News anchors is quite the hurdle, but this film is the best #MeToo film to date and a must see."

Topics that could make a sailor blush - but lots of laughs.

Eternals is messy but there is beauty in its parts if not necessarily the sum.
"By approaching Marshall as just another idealistic young trial lawyer, the film stands on its own as a compelling courtroom drama, complete with surprising revelations ..."

"It won't blow you away, but it remains a well-played and solidly entertaining family film."
"The story is good enough to tell itself, and the filmmakers should have let it."

"The Hunt for Planet B delivers a captivating viewing experience, showing the sometimes-thin line between science fiction and the true scientific future."

"Serra self-consciously removes his film from the assaultive world of media. Its slow pace and dark, lush setting require attention but also a forgetting or abandonment of the world outside."
A welcome introduction to a remarkable man.
Every scene is permeated by a creeping sense of dread.

It's a social and political commentary of a modern day industrial power and the polarisation and inequality prevalent in most developing nations.
Phoenix's performance overwhelms the slight story.
"Lighter and loopier than Bogdanovich's key '70s pics and naughtier and rather more cynical than his woofy What's Up, Doc?, She's Funny That Way is certainly amusing for the first and second acts."
"With its jittery stop-motion animation, exquisitely detailed shots, and outwardly self-aware characters,[it's] the epitome of artifice. It's also as bright and cheery a time as you'll have at the movies this year."
A powerful and atmospheric film that delivers a barrage of images and concepts of both sexual and philosophical natures.

"Like another Australian musical by a then young director, Gillian Armstrong's Starstruck from 1982, Bran Nue Dae carries the day with energy and self-belief."

"When 2014 Godzilla finally fully emerges from the deep like a gloriously meaty centerfold straight out of Bulk Reptile magazine -- a creation that's part performance capture, part computer stuff, thankfully looking nothing like a CG cartoon -- we cheer."
"The film overextends itself a little as twist piles upon twist and in terms of narrative it's not entirely successful, but as a masterclass in microbudget film-making this is well worth a look."
A touching film that perhaps spends a bit too much time digging in the wrong places.

"Durham is a decent enough way to pass away a few hours on a weekend, especially if you love the game, but it ain't gonna change your life."

"It's a film that deserves to be seen, be discussed and win awards."
"Normally I'm not averse to time-shifting in movies, but in this case I found the device unhelpful. Individual scenes are superbly staged and the cast is flawless, making the film essential viewing for lovers of the book."
"Dujardin keeps Georges innocent, almost paternally daffy, as he shuffles toward madness..."
"Look beyond all the staple elements of Disney animations and you'll see two strong, complicated female characters. Those seem hard to come by even in live-action films."

A tribute to how entrenched the Rugrats are in our hearts.

"Stirring film, capable of moving you even as it gives you a new perspective from the past on an issue that continues to plague us, here in the future."
"Rock's script isn't afraid to get raunchy, sometimes a little too much, but there is a bit of heart at the center. Dawson and Rock have the chemistry to make it work, even when it feels a little contrived."

"Hilarious, fast, funny, fresh fun for the family."
"A delightfully silly and laugh-out-loud funny animated comedy, Flushed Away bodes happily for future collaborations between DreamWorks Animation and Aardman Features."

The movie that's going to make Emile Hirsch a big star.
Nightbreed is a clear queer allegory that feels slightly incomplete&#46; Barker&apos;s ambition outweighs what the film can deliver&#44; particularly when it has been so significantly tampered with&#44; but the concept&#44; the make-up &amp; Cronenberg&apos;s perf make this worthwhile

This is a movie with bruised shins and a huge heart.
"In some ways, this is Art House 101 stuff -- the kind of movie you just know is good for you, because it's so dull and depressing.That, however, is merely one aspect of it."
"You can feel your brain melting away as you watch it, and that's not always a bad sensation."
"The director introduces an interesting framing device, interviewing his main characters dressed in plain clothes and facing a camera, the full significance of this reality-show type setup only becoming apparent at the end of the film."

"Reynolds has clearly been hired to deliver Deadpool-esque deadpan, which he does with aplomb."

"Amazingly fluid and drop-dead gorgeous, Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is the best-looking, stop-motion animation film ever."
"The birth of Parinya's gender struggle is Freudian to the nth degree, but the confusion is evoked as a magical-realist pageantry of clashing cultural and sexual signifiers."

The mutant super-pig film you never knew you wanted.
"At the heart of it, Blame is more than just a competently-shot movie - it's a love letter pulled from a time-capsule, its ink blotchy and not curated for nostalgia."

"A spunky, original take on a theme that will resonate with singles of many ages."

The casting is great and the performances are top notch. The epic tone helps a lot. [Full review in Spanish]

The Woman King is a big&#44; broad action epic that&#8217;s designed to be a crowd-pleaser&#46; 
"Director Brad Anderson throws in a red herring or two as he comments on Eurotrash and the greed-fueled lawlessness of the former Soviet Union, but he ultimately makes an even stronger statement about the dark side of female empowerment."

"Kurosawa shows, in masterful way, that creepiness lurks at the surface of society, just behind the façade of daily life, hidden in plain sight."

"To put it plainly, Lean on Pete is writer-director Andrew Haigh's best work."
"It's funny and sweet and curious about the nature of dude friendship, although Shelton, like her characters, equivocates a little too much about the eventual outcome."

"What sustains the film through the rockier times are its challenging themes, offering real issues for the young protagonists to wrestle with, rather than whether anyone will be carded trying to buy beer."
You can always count on Guillermo del Toro to have a beautiful-looking movie... And it takes the dark concepts of the original movie and twists them even more.
I think I love best that Ruiz found a way to adapt this frothy tale to an equally frothy style of filmmaking. It's alive in the most passionate way.

... unnerving take on the home-invasion picture...

I love this film... I was able to absorb the richness of these much more than I did before.

"Obscuro Barroco privileges other ways of knowing: a material engagement with the world that neither fixes nor categorises, but makes space for new becomings."
"Offsetting the chilly voyeurism is a viable teen romance and an appealing sense of humor. Though there are occasional lapses in logic, Disturbia is consistently suspenseful and entertainingly disturbing."
"The heartfelt, personal Microbe & Gasoline may be Gondry's best work since the still incredible Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind."
"The truth is, the DC Justice League version of Captain Marvel is a lot of fun, mostly family friendly (except for a monster biting off a guy's head), and just a tad too long to earn an extra 50 cents in yours truly's money-tinged ratings system."
"[Quentin Tarantino has] whacked history over the head and cut away all the boring bits, leaving behind a blood-drenched war epic like no other."
"A challenging and topical consideration of the queer experience, filtered through a racialized 90s lens. Bowyer-Chapman is great and while Spiral doesn't have the supportive gay relationship some viewers want, it's still valuable LGBT representation"

Bardem gives what might have been too slow and plodding a movie its heart and its humor.

Shear entertainment.
An uplifting and enriching cautionary tale about one man's spiritual adventure on the road and in the wilderness.
"Screenwriting teachers will tell you that if you don't hook your audience in the first 10 minutes, you've lost them for the full two hours. Director Duncan Jones and writer Ben Ripley have crafted a thriller that does it in only eight."

An experience sometimes hard to endure but not to be missed.
"You see how brilliant an actor Clift was. You see his love of the art of storytelling, developing characters with depth and dimension, and his willingness to put the final product over his own ego."
Kidd's wickedly irreverent and succulent narrative cunningly cuts to the quick in the way it examines the boorish behavior of male mischievousness that ultimately serves as the needed comeuppance to redefine their consciousness.

"If Selznick's story isn't remarkable, Haynes and the cast ... breathe enough soul into it as compensation."

"Sections of Malick's expansive, fitfully brilliant, occasionally sloppy film are so powerful that you can only gaze up at the screen in wordless awe."

"""Stronger"" never leaves the comfort zone it established in the first half of the film, and so the finale doesn't quite deliver on all fronts, but it's a valiant effort by Gordon Green regardless."
What allows We Are Marshall to stand above many of the other 2006 sports movies is both the undeniable power of the story itself and the strong ensemble McG gathered to tell it.

Cate Blanchett has her fingers on the pulse as a lost woman who rediscovers her creativity and her corresponding self-love.
"It's ridiculous, but Herbert Brenon has a winning way with the spectacular set pieces that the story demands. And the scenes are always stolen by the supporting cast."
"King clearly wants to do right by these people, but at a certain point his empathy begins to hurt the film as much as it helps it, leaving us with the unsolvable irony of a movie that rings true only when it goes off the rails."
"DuVernay and her team have made a picture that is entertaining and thrilling, while also being about something important. Not many others can say the same thing."

"Although Doctor Sleep is flawed, it's arguably the best of a surprisingly strong group of movies that prove King's enduring popularity as he enters his sixth decade as a professional writer."
"I was delighted by the third-act developments in what had already been a witty, strange comedy. I'm not sure what I saw, but I'm glad I saw it."

A breathless thriller that doesn&#8217;t let up from minute one until the very end&#46; 
a slightly over-sweet teen classic

"The movie fulfills a need for smart tween/middle grade drama at the multiplex, where it has had little competition this year."
"The film crystallises Jackie's dignity and pathos, and, also crucially, the sheer brutality of a way of life being completely wrenched from someone in a matter of hours."

"Agora may be flawed as a narrative feature, but it is a first-class conversation starter."
"At its heart, [Hustlers] is a heist movie, only with a buddy comedy sensibility, all of it powered by the pop culture dynamo that is J-Lo. So yeah - hit the club and make it rain. You'll be glad you did."

"The film's brand of Americana is pretty, but very Hollywood: hard scrabble but not hard won."

"Lowbrow plus highbrow does not equal middlebrow, and the breezy accessibility of Private Fears in Public Places does not make it any less a work of art than Resnais's more difficult early successes."

A watchable action vehicle with some thoughtful futuristic touches and an attempt to grapple with larger issues.
Engaging romantic fable about a young man who fulfils his destiny by falling in love with the woman of his dreams.

When it comes to captivating filmmaking and epic scale even with limited sets&#44; 1948&apos;s Hamlet is an honest masterpiece&#46;

"The script's details are gleefully impish, constantly poking fun at Disney"
"A perfectly enjoyable exercise in superheroics, and much more fun to watch than 'Man of Steel'."

There are many characters in this ensemble and the film provides much insight by looking at the situation through all of their eyes.
"Alex Kurtzman, in his directorial debut, delivers a compelling and emotional dramedy about a man who discovers he has a sister he knew nothing about."
"Kim Horton skillfully weaves together clips from past films - the participants' lives inside a fishbowl literally flashing before our eyes - and both Apted's narration and his gently needling, off-camera interrogations give you all the context you need."
"Though predictable and often preposterous, this warm and funny wish-fulfilling fantasy is a richly rewarding ride."

"Fans, and I count myself among them, of the Weitz brothers' unexpectedly enjoyable original will find themselves in a familiar and perhaps comforting place... filthy language, risqu situations, die-hard friendships, and all."
"A whirlwind comedy of absurdist humour, zany happenstance and good old slapstick."

The subject&apos;s thoughts count more than the plot&#46;
"A tantalising, sometimes frustrating parable about the menaces that human beings might face from unexpected quarters."
"Fresh feminist horror of a very welcome taboo-smashing kind. Nasty, hilarious, outraged and outrageous, and as poignant as it is blackly funny."
"Director Cathy Yan (Dead Pigs, 2018) knows how to use the broken character as a narrative tool very well, and finally, gives Harley Quinn the movie she deserves. [Full review in Spanish]"

The Cooler is Leaving Las Vegas recast as a fairy tale of sorts.

"The sleeper hit of the year, a rocket out of Sundance trailing Oscar nominations for Hawkes and Hunt and, with luck, writer-director Lewin."
"Even with too much focus on the former character, Frank & Lola, buoyed by Shannon's performance and Ross' acute eye for the seediness of his environments, is a commendable debut."
"Sticklers for plot and character work will find themselves frustrated, but for those simply looking to enjoy tacos and bloodletting with a fun group of maniacs, Birds of Prey scratches that itch and then some."
Touches are just enough to earn The Good Shepherd a third star. But De Niro might want to stick to acting in future.
Makes you wish we had someone like Churchill to help fight the Nazis this time.

"Andersson's movie reveals poetic ironies, surreal slapstick and melancholy truths, often all wrapped up together. The gloom gets a bit thick over the 92 minutes, but there are sequences here you will never forget."
"[The similar] 'Omar,' a recent Oscar nominee, is better directed, with assured long takes by an established talent, Hany Abu-Assad ('Paradise Now'). 'Bethlehem' has the better, cleaner script, and the best performance of the two."

Welles' Harry Lime looms over the narrative just as the shadow of World War II looms over the film's post-war Vienna.
"Sadly, this expert and powerfully important film likely will spawn a sequel before all of this is finally over. Look at Totally Under Control as Act I."
"Linklater hasn't just crafted a detached portrait of a unique couple: he's painting a masterful examination of human nature, of that relationship we all want, but too often sadly see slip away."

Bud and Lou meet another monster for infrequent laughs.

"A poetic, mesmerizing fusion of fairy tale and cultural commentary from director Jessica Oreck."
"Odom, Ben-Adir, Goree and Hodge are an ensemble of strength and flair. It was a pleasure to witness so many phenoms at work simultaneously. Without hesitation, every man shined just as bright as the next."

"Blue Jasmine is one of Allen's cleverest and most compassionate films, making it also one of his greatest."

This is an incredibly sweet - and occasionally bittersweet - tale about family and love that will move and entertain audiences...
This is one of those movies which make you want to know what happens to the characters later on.

"23 times hotter, 200 times smarter than Fifty Shades of Grey."
"At least these superfriends can still crack a joke (I've never been more grateful for Anthony Mackie's light touch) and, for all its seriousness, Civil War sustains a much-needed sense of humor."

Was Die Hard 4 taken? I know that there are better minds in Hollywood than this that come up with a more appropriate and not so annoying title.
&#8220;Uncharted&#8221; really leans on its star power&#44; especially Holland who plays a very Holland-like character &#8211; charismatic&#44; boyishly charming&#44; a bit daffy&#44; and with an unshakable innocence &#40;even when he tries to talk tough&#41;&#46; 
"In Mark Of An Angel the misdirection is sometimes subtle, sometimes not so, but director Safy Nebbou in the end deserves the benefit of the doubt for just about preserving credibility when the plot goes into a wild reverse skid."

"If only all debut films were like this: story, style and substance."
The greatest Steven Spielberg movie since the last great one? Sure.

A muddled tale of a corporate high-flying huckster brought low.
Even tweens will enjoy this road trip with Goofy.

"My only reservation about the movie, not a serious one but a nagging one, is that watching the film it's hard to see why the Coens wanted to make it."
This is a lively affair with treats for fans and a barrage of entertainment for all.
"A flashy Robin Hood-ish drama of female empowerment, Hustlers is recommended viewing."
"most of the chase sequences feature more jiggle than you'd get in a ""Three's Company"" marathon. As her astounding exercise regimen shows, Lara treats her body like a temple; many will worship it."

"John Callahan's life becomes one of the most interesting recent portraits of an artist's journey. But the beauty of Van Sant's approach is that he brings it down to earth, because every life is a hard road traveled."
"It's a quasi-religious fable about a man haunted by the past and facing a profound moral and existential crisis in the present, and it's a dazzling display of virtuoso cinematic technique and showboat performances."
"""The Iron Lady"" is keenly attuned to the small indignities of a woman trying to elbow her way into a man's world."
A thoroughly great time&#33;
Baumbach perfectly captures the atmosphere of a childhood marred by emotional fisticuffs.

A striking view of a neglected generation...
"Eddie Murphy is a genius, the original is arguably the funniest movie ever made...not a bad movie, but more nostalgic than funny, a cinematic greatest hits package...surprisingly heart-felt, and the fans won't mind the films flaws..."

"Nightcrawler doesn't err cautiously but on the side of discomfort, and you have to admire that."
"Arresting and heart-stopping, Number 37 is a fiercely acted and directed tale of the intense mayhem that can be born out of anger, desperation, and sheer entitlement. The buildup alone is worth the ride."
"A genre-bending story of bullying and social media, Sissy is equal parts slasher and coming-of-age film with a different type of happy ending that will leave you on the edge of your seat."
"Moronic set-ups sap the fun factor... yet, Keeping Up with the Joneses still functions because it delivers something we continue to crave on the carousel, where the Kardashians and Joneses of the world will always be on the horse ahead of ours."

There's a bit of a sense of Bourne style action except you can follow it.

Kate Beckinsale is reason enough to go see this movie.
"Loving is a first-class actors' picnic, with the advantage of having real-life meaning in the always-thorny arena of American race relations."
"Knightley winningly portrays the arc of a fighter. Colette is ultimately a feminist tale, but never one that wallows in self-pity or seriousness. It is also carried along lightly by a script with a streak of wit ."
"It's not nearly sophisticated enough to match the complexity of its characters, whose labyrinthine romantic entanglements have a truthful ring to them."
"Journalism is all about having the courage to write the truth even if it will get you mocked by your relatives and co-workers, so here goes: Space Chimps is hilarious."

"There are so many tonal shifts, big laughs, awkward laughs, long silences, explosions of anger, and cuttingly clever jabs that your head will spin (mine almost spun right off my neck)."

"The new comedy Baby Mama never comes fully to term, as it were."
"This movie, set in India, along with 'Nuevo orden' (2020) of Mexico, are both effective cautionary tales of the inherent dangers posed by income inequality and corruption. This is a danger in America as well, but nobody is paying attention, yet."

"One of the great strengths of Farewell Amor is its intimacy, the sense it conveys of three people close together yet emotionally distant in Walter's small, narrow Brooklyn apartment. Another strength, and a huge one, is Mr. Mwine's portrayal of Walter."
"Hardly a massive gamble, Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher play a safe romcom hand you can tolerate."

"Once we know them a bit, Rose and Teddy are decent company. The dilemmas that brought them to where they are at present are credible and the acting is good."
"Ted's Boston-accented zingers are expertly delivered by the director/star, whose voice talent is undeniable, and Wahlberg again demonstrates that he's skilled at comedy ... Seyfried proves adept as well ..."
"Paddington isn't just the film of the year, it might actually be one of the finest family films ever made."
"Though the sky might be falling, ""Thunder Road"" swirls about the tragicomedy of Officer Arnaud's plight with ease. It's hard to really forge a film that can wreck you and play with such liveliness."

This is very good piece of filmmaking.
"This is the movie puts the ""oooh"" back in ""boo."""

&#8220;Babe&#58; Pig in the City&#8221; is a wonderful family motion picture that touches various topics&#44; but doesn&#8217;t live up to the power and overwhelming brilliance of the original&#46;
"The Disappearance of Alice Creed begins with a van being stolen and ends with a different stolen vehicle being driven away. In between comes a tight, efficient thriller with just three actors and at least two whopper switcheroos."
"Where the original was defiantly not a concert film, but a chronicle of the astonished hubbub surrounding the first hipster folksinger, the follow-up's treasure lies with seven intact live performances."
"The film ends up being very nearly as good [as House of Usher], and better in some respects."
The Nightshifter is at its best when it's focused on the more grounded reality of Stênio's life and the very real and violent world around him.

"Extremely well crafted and scripted ... Fun, propulsive, ingenious and quite loveable."
"Most movies of this type re-create the action far from the actual scene of the crime, but Macdonald has invented a new subgenre: a docudrama in which the docu and the drama are equally authentic."
"A war story that takes no sides because it takes all sides. And it's a period piece, set in the last decades of the 12th century after Christ, that resonates in a thoughtful way today."
"It matters little that the film is rife with non sequiturs, nonsense and nihilistic violence, because its heroes are so darn buoyant and charming."
"Eternals has the expected thrilling action scenes but the non-action scenes might be too quiet and introspective for some fans ... However, the showdowns in the last third of the movie make up for the meandering story in the rest of Eternals."

"The movie sucks the audience into the power of the confessions, then shows us what really happened."

"An enjoyable, if flawed sci-fi thriller that's worth seeing for Fassbot and Noomi Rapace."
"Beattie has made a rousing directorial debut that could and should become a monster international hit. Marsden has written a further nine books about Ellie's exploits: bring them on as films, I say."

"Short Term 12 races by with its brief running time, but its ambling plot works to reveal a naturalistic discovery of its characters."

Pain and Glory wants to be 8 1/2 but seemed to me about six-and-a-quarter.

Even the recurring passages of pin-drop silence generate edge-of-the-seat dread.

The main reason anyone should check out Split is to marvel at McAvoy's breathtaking performance.
"If you want to see ""Force Majeure,"" rent it and stream it. If you want to see two terrific comic talents circling around it in something lighter and funnier, then ""Downhill"" it is."

"Jonze has crafted a sublime movie that's part dark satire, part metaphysical comedy, part bittersweet romance, part brain-bending sci-fi fable."

As gripping and entertaining as any thriller you'll encounter.
"Mann's first movie with feeling; his overwhelming love of its subject will turn audiences into exuberant, thrilled fight crowds."
"Witty about social pretensions, eloquent about failure & loss, acerbic about family, Allen's light-handed tragedy is a major work. Blanchett is dazzling as the fragile heroine."

Gibson keeps this movie afloat.
"For a movie that lasts longer than two hours and is made up solely of talking, it's impressive that the story never seems to drag."

"Ultimately, though, it's the music that really matters, and Hackford certainly doesn't deny his audience that pleasure."

A defiantly idiosyncratic film that summons the spirits of great Italian directors long past.

"Wright's screenplay has a third act problem, where the revealing of the whats-and-hows aren't as interesting being lost in the whys."
"Winchester '73 is simply one of the finest Westerns ever made, in a class with the best of Ford and Hawks."
... the distraction-free bubble focuses the story on the key players and their emotional motivations to achieve maximum impact... (but) the real villain of this story is human fragility.
Adler's screenplay is excellent; it isn't often that a film takes an insightful look at how people can become unraveled.
A formidable actor's showcase.

"At once gossamer and purposeful, it's Terrence Malick with a map."
"As much as I respect Climates, I can sympathize with viewers who will balk at the film's pretensions and glacial pacing."
"Arriving at a bleak time in modern history, the unbridled enthusiasm and playful attitude found within this film gleefully provide the perfect escapism we're likely all craving."
"While not everything here works, this is a poetical and distinctive effort whose commentary ultimately seems to go beyond gender relations to indict humanity's abuse of nature, and suggest an apocalyptic end result to climate change."
"Ultimately, rather than sex, what seems threatening here is impending adulthood in all its dimensions, and in its floaty, insubstantial way, It Follows catches some of the mingled excitement and terror of growing up."

"Every bit as funny as ""Analyze This."""
"I love the straightforward gall of Frozen. Here's a horror film that's confident enough to abandon superficial scares in favor of a far more insidious, intellectual concept"

"Stewart's strained stoicism bounces nicely off of Maadi's winningly garrulous performance, which he has to give almost entirely through a small window in the door of Amir's cell."

It's hard to recapture or exceed that magical feeling of seeing something new and unique as the first Incredibles presented itself to be. Incredibles 2 is such a worthy sequel that it certainly warrants another sequel to become a bigger franchise.

...heartfelt and poetic...

This is an amazing movie.
Dany Boon is like a mime you don't want to shoot.
"[""Daddy Day Care""] is a straightforward, don't-expect-any-surprises kind of pre-summer entertainment that has a good supporting cast, precocious kids and a premise that lends itself to slapstick comedy."
THEM! was one of the better Fifties science fiction films and one of only a handful that are still fairly effective forty years after it was made due in large part to some very intelligent script choices.

Taxi Driver is a cinematic masterpiece and Scorsese&apos;s best direction of his career&#46;
Redford and Newman provide the real sting.
"It's uplifting and inspiring to see a coach who brings out the best in his girls. Like the documentary Hoop Dreams, this turns out to be a whole lot more than just a movie about basketball."
Material like this is only as good as the acting and writing. The Ref is skillful in both areas.
"Whenever Jarmusch lets his soundtrack - and his stars - do the talking, the right notes get struck."
The studio's lackluster release will likely mean it'll thrive on DVD. Don't wait for that. Youth in Revolt is worth making a trip to the theaters.

An exuberant celebration of moviemaking.
"Inventively examines bigotry, combining daring humor and hyperbole, dark realism and shining idealism."
This thing is equal parts a hoot and a gasp-inducer.
"Roth's satire of fright junkie male castration fears and feminist castration fantasies, mandates that you're going to have to have your cock and eat it too, whether consumed live during elegant dining to the sound of opera, or by killer canine pets."
An appealing romantic drama that proves it is never too late to turn your life around by taking a risky leap into the dark.
"What we have here is a deeply flawed but frequently rewarding picture, with a lot to say about how stories can both guide and misguide us."
"Even if you're not all that familiar with the duo Sparks, you're likely to finish the film with a giant smile on your face and not just because they were your ""favorite band's favorite band,"" as the doc's tagline proclaims."
I was ensnared by its stoner charms.
"Expect nominations all around, with actor/writer/director/producer and songwriter Cooper on the verge of a boatload, maybe even for contributing to an eclectic, sure-to-be-soaring soundtrack."
"A nice mix of old-fashioned imagination (anagrams, pranks, secret spaces) and newfangled effects (gizmos, gadgets, graphics), it's a rollicking, never obnoxious family flick."
"Silly, surreal and squeezable, SpongeBob scores again."
"""The Descendants"" goes on too long, but that's its only flaw. And frankly, I can see why Payne and his editor decided to go with this print instead of making some awfully tough decisions."
"John Carter, a rousing science-fiction adventure adapted from Edgar Rice Burroughs' early 20th-century pulp novels, is a rare bird that's at the same time strikingly modern and engagingly old-fashioned."
"Haddish is a wild-card actress that Lee keeps playing in Girls Trip, and he draws an inside straight nearly every time."
"Below... is a stripped-back, pitch-black sci-fi farce."
A fascinating account of a man who loved stirring the pot until he was the one sitting in it.
"What works best in Anne Rice's books are the depth of characters and their psyches. Which is also one of the hardest things to incorporate into film, and notably absent..."
"The abundance of footage, and the space it's given to breathe - the movie is almost two and a half hours long - captures the restless loneliness of superstardom."
"There's no reinventing of the wheel here, but an authentic, enthusiastic and well-observed continuation of the universe."
Equally provocative and profound&#44; On the Count of Three tackles an often ignored conversation with the gravity it deserves&#46; 
"Avoiding the sensationalism that would have come so easily, the skill with which Meyers varies the tone of My Friend Dahmer, as he takes us from humour to darkness and back again, is simply compelling."
A picture of cultural displacement and Anglo-Indian rapprochement almost worthy of EM Forster.
"A thoroughly entertaining, mischievous comic romp."
"In terms of intellectual and emotional stimulation, who could ask for more?"
It was all the things that you want from an M. Night Shyamalan movie.

"Boorman has crafted a witty, classy and richly enjoyable morality play, which skewers the mercenary self-interest behind Anglo-American imperialism almost as an afterthought."
The film turns what at first seemingly appears as Kodak moments into a study of a soul in transition.
"..it's director Vaughn who emerges as the true hero here (the less said of January Jones' leaden performance, the better), using a breathless pace and off-kilter compositions to mask the story's many gaps in logic."
"Joel Edgerton has crafted a compassionate family drama with extraordinary performances from Lucas Hedges, Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe"
"A movie with good humor, good music and a positive message that isn't a complete embarrassment to watch."

"Lloyd makes something genuinely nightmarish of the worst attacks, but Dunne's creased vulnerability ... keeps us tethered to waking reality."

Another masterpiece from Wim Wenders and Sam Shepard.
"I can't say that Rat Film is a cheery experience, but it's certainly an indelible one."
"The film finds its strength in the quintet of lesser known players, especially Zapruder and, oddly enough, Oswald's stoic brother, who's cast in a heroic, almost Kennedy-esque, light."
&#8230;with no body-horror&#44; gore or even effects&#44; Schroeder does a remarkable job of maintaining grown-up narrative tension&#44; and the pay-off is surprising satisfying&#8230;
"The result, while it might greatly affront scholars, is a film brimming with warmth, heart and intelligence. Remarkably, it is O’Connor’s directorial debut."
A stylish if somewhat disjointed film.
"It's dysfunctional, but strangely affirming."
The fact that it&#8217;s such a standard&#44; nothing special&#44; screenplay is a letdown&#44; but the aerial scenes are first-rate&#44; and the actors are believable&#44; even when saddled with tired cliches&#46;
"Sam Elliott's smoky, whiskey-soaked baritone is one of American cinema's undervalued treasures... It pretty much rescues Brett Haley's... The Hero, cutting clean through the film's pile of clichs with its gruff feeling and wry, weary wit."
"Remarkable! A small, intimate kind of movie that deserves to be cradled and cherished, not slathered in crass award-show buzz and industry politics."
"With churning performances and a terrific recreation of the period, the film is a startling story of a woman caught in an impossible situation. So it's a shame that it's rather muted."

Spendid!
"Sly, good-natured and fun, despite the presence of Tim Allen."
"Despite its humble nature, the film is downright uplifting without being vulgar, flashy or embarrassing."

"It's fascinating stuff, not least because this era of film history is rarely explored, especially in formats as accessible as this."
"Slow but intelligent, moody, and mature, this thriller isn't exactly thrilling, yet it's hypnotic in the way it zooms in on little messy, unexpected human behaviors."
"""Belle"" is his most visually ambitious to date, possessing the world wide web maximalism of ""Summer Wars"" and the vibrant mayhem of Satoshi Kon's ""Paprika."""
An unusual director with his antenna attuned to social class...Bong has emerged over the past decade as a globally significant filmmaker.
"With each passing day, Bong Joon-ho's class-conscious thriller about a family that lives in a sub-basement-and the blissfully naïve rich family they wind up working for-becomes even more prescient."

"There's such a graceful sense of restraint in how this real-life tragedy is treated, one that filters any potential for ripped-from-yesterday's-headlines sensationalism through a respectful requiem of loss and grief."
It's a good fit for anyone who loves fine acting.
"Kite Runner remains an effective, deeply felt meditation on forgiveness, and when it stays near the characters, it's some of the best filmmaking Marc Forster has ever accomplished."
One of the things I liked best about the film is how it is grounded in the grim economics of the newspaper and recording industries.

"The ending isn't really earned by the characters or the script but the idea of a reverse origin story was mildly interesting. It wasn't great but I didn't hate it, so there you go! McAvoy steals the show once again"
I'll take this visceral and disturbing look at the Catholic molestation cover-up over the middle-distance politeness of Spotlight any day.
"Hitchcock's visual storytelling chops are on full display in this film, and one montage sequence so impressed contemporary audiences that it received a round of applause at the film's premiere."
"Black Hawk Down superbly visualizes journalist-author Mark Bowden's bestselling 'tale of modern war,' detailing a U.S. military misadventure in the Somalia of 1993."
"Everything Everywhere All at Once may be a kaleidoscopic fantasy battle across space, time, genres, and emotions, but it’s an incredibly moving family drama first."

Remarkably subtle and perceptive straightforward narrative on the rise of French fascism.
"The forceful script is shuddery, steadily building to an astonishing courtroom showdown and a devastating finale, where heartbreak and agony are certain to cloud redemption."

"Chris Bell's very personal documentary, tracking how steroid use influenced his body building family's game, health and interpersonal relationships, is neither an apology nor a hard-lined expose about doping."

"There is humor strewn throughout Doctor Strange, although it sometimes felt like (at times) it was too much."

As revealing about Jim Carrey as it is about Andy Kaufman.
Hittman portrays the reality of youth without transgressing or judging. An urgent film about femininity and adolescence... [Full review in Spanish]
"While not quite reaching the compelling, claustrophobic and queasy heights of Das Boot, director Aaron Schneider (Get Low) does an excellent job of thrusting the viewer into the cramped conditions and chaos of life aboard the Keeling."
"Deadpan funny drama, played against a minimalist backdrop, brings home some simple truths about the desperate lives most people lead."
"... a humble curtsy to the Echo Park area of Los Angeles, to Chicano resilience and the Mexican rite of 15-year-old girl virgins having a lavish party debut of adulthood."
"Occasionally, the dialogue clunks but a winningly vulnerable performance from Marinca goes a long way to building up a picture of a compromised world of political horse-trading where even war criminals can get away with it."
... a beautiful piece of work.
"This is not just the first feature by Haifaa Al Mansour but the first feature to be directed by a woman from Saudi Arabia. That is quite a burden, and yet by some miracle the movie bears it with lightness and grace."
The push and pull of this movie is really between the lead character and the audience. One moment we feel compassionate: he wants to do the right thing. The next moment he's gone down the cover-up rabbit hole and is an irredeemable swine.

"Bright and eager to please, it reworks themes and situations from teen films of a generation ago in a manner that makes a surprising amount of sense today."
...my favorite of the three.

"There's some genuine heart here, particularly in Sam and Matt's subplot."
"If only he could have satisfied himself with this area of expertise, people would still talk of Steve Martin as one of the kings of comic cinema."
"Teens should eat up this fantasy's scenery-chewing angst and doom, and the hopeful tale of survival and empowerment (to be continued in the inevitable sequel or sequels)."
"Director John Stockwell takes a thin concept and executes it with a certain level of maturity and skill, not to mention a gorgeous visual touch."
"Roy Andersson's specific aesthetic on full display--an overcast blue-gray world of personal horrors, disappointing inanity and compromised beauty reminiscent of philosophical, art-cinema sketch comedy. Works better in context with his other movies."

Surprise hovers over this dry-roasted and altogether compelling Irish comedy-drama like a creature waiting to stun the cast of the movie into submission.
One of the more quotable comedies of the 1980s
"A small-scale indie with bountiful ambitions, this resourceful debut ballasts a great deal of conceptual idiosyncrasy ... with strict observations of personality, behavior and the textures of space."
The most adventuresome element in The Wackness isn't its pop-culture skin but the unlikely friendship of Luke and Squires.
"Private eye mysteries are so rare these days - indeed, the form is almost extinct on the big screen - that the film ends up feeling surprisingly fresh."
"...it delivers its knowingly unrefined thrills in a smart, engaging and not unpleasantly ruthless way, and never lets its cheekiness get in the way of its creepiness."
Another John Grisham book forms the basis for another decent (if not dazzling) courtroom drama.
A wry humored cop thriller.
The foulest holiday movie I've ever seen -- and the funniest.
"It's a slight, often affecting story that mixes the confusion of contemporary life with nostalgic yearning for a time when the whole boy-meets-girl thing was less complicated."
"Straight Outta Compton functions as both a compelling, damnably topical political statement and a slickly produced piece of commercial art."
"Director David O. Russell's film is dragged down by a confusing tone, but makes up for it with a satisfying look at the way Mangano built her business empire from the ground up."
"It follows a pretty familiar arc, but it hits the required beats with style and a couple of surprisingly well-considered performances."
Becky is a breezy blast and a gnarly genre gem that horrifically turns the plot of Home Alone on its head&#44; with terrific turns from Lulu Wilson and Kevin James&#46;&#10;&#10;

"It does such a thought-through, empathetic, and powerful job of exploring homophobia as part of a root-and-branch mentality in South Africa's white patriarchal psyche."
Amusingly silly horror flick with better than average production values
"Peter and Ethan are not people you'd care to have sitting next to you on the shortest of bus trips, let alone a 2,000-mile car journey, but Downey Jr and Galifianakis make Due Date well worth the ride."

"Rude, crude but often delightful and fresh business farce."
"The stories feed into each other, helped by some subtle writing and restrained performances, and the drama slowly deepens."
The shards of this film have more audacity and intelligence than most of what is out there and its failures are more interesting to ponder than most films' successes.
"A superb sports film, based on the best-selling book by David Peace."
"With the same anchor of family and hope in the younger generation, Peninsula is a worthy follow up to Train to Busan, if a little more of what wed expect from a typical zombie action film."
"Majewski's filmic voice isn't for everyone, filled with lengthy tableaus without obvious meaning, but it's strong and truly unique."

A good and enjoyable surprise. [Full review in Spanish]

A perfectly amiable and often funny animation feature aimed largely at children but not childish or pandering in any way.
24 Jump Street on TV is a drama. The movie no way takes itself seriously. That helps. Lots. So does an R-rating where the characters are free to -- uh -- express themselves.

With &#8220;1917&#8221; Sam Mendes takes his audience on a perilous journey driven by a simple but tightly-wound story soaked in an unending tension&#46; It&#8217;s a harrowing tale of heroism&#44; friendship&#44; and sacrifice&#46;

"What elevates way above the merely adequate script by Sean Reycraft based on the novel by Michael Downing and Lynd's competent direction is young Noah Bernett as Scot. This kid is so great, he could give kid actors a good name again."

"Worth seeing for DiCaprio's performance, which is sadly hampered by confusing direction and a poorly constructed screenplay."
"It's a joy to watch comedy unfold so naturally, the laughs gently teased out from our growing knowledge of the characters, their imperfections, doubts and, yes, emotional pain."
The rare sequel that holds up to the original. It's respectful to the story but more importantly it's respectful to the audiences who have grown to love these characters.
"Closed Curtain enfolds its politics within what I believe will go down as one of cinema's finest, most complex acts of self-portraiture."

Gives a wonderful behind-the-scenes look at the theatre business

A terrific feminist take on one of the most popular characters in British history.
"The script, penned by Mohler and Brittany Shaw, doesnt reach the excitement of a court drama and honestly lacks tension throughout, but the film is salvaged by the performances of its leads and supporting cast."

"a genuinely wonderful film that, despite its atypical source, finally gives [Patricia Highsmith's] writing its deserved work."
John C. Reilly's work is Oscar-worthy.

"The ""Fresh Prince"" is dead! Long live the ""King!"""
"A completely addictive, seemingly relaxed and formless ramble through weeks of rehearsal and performance footage."
"Baffling from beginning to end, but also woozily beautiful."

Clint Eastwood's latest portrait of a man of violence unfolds with an immediacy that the octogenarian multi-hyphenate rarely musters anymore.

"Under Delbert Mann's direction, these familiar movie land marks burst suddenly into moving and unfamiliar life."

I like the sequel as well as the original

You feel sick and indicted by it--and that's exactly how you ought to feel.
"How much you get out of this American indie romcom will depend on where you stand on Keira Knightley doing her goofy, 'What me?' normal girl routine."
"Though a contemporary story, it plays out like an old-fashioned dramatic-thriller, and while lacking standout action sequences it sustains itself thanks to atmosphere and performances rather than special effects and grandstanding sequences."

It misses on the big emotional gut-punch -- but it's good enough at least that you wish it was better.
Kovgan's respect for the work as well as the life of her subject is clear and she's captured much of that spirit.
"Thankfully, the strong performances make it easy to watch. I just wish the filmmakers had the conviction to make this into a truly great film. (Parental Review also Available)"

On paper this hacky plot must have sounded terrible but the actors sell it&#44; making their characters elicit empathy and the entire concept believable&#46;
"If Kung Fu Panda 3 feels like a step down, it's only because it's got a sterling pedigree to live up to."

"And while some of the laughs are certainly hilarious, they aren't as plentiful as necessary to make Norbit a consistently funny film."

"Consider the $4,970,802,499 its quintet of leads has made for Paramount at the box office as long-held escrow on a legendary prank. Robert Downey Jr. is all wild-eyed brilliance, Tom Cruise is re-christened in cool and the film is comic gold."

"Air Doll works as an interesting, solid drama and character study while also addressing much bigger real-world themes and ideas, including loneliness and the roles of women in society. "

"Carney understands how music not only provides a soundtrack for a life, but can change a life, too."
"Lapica's debut impresses with its strong, clear voice and desire to tell a very personal story not just of substance abuse but of that abuse's painful root cause."
"Using a comic book as a template rather than merely a guide, Rodriguez and Miller have fused fantasy and noir to create a truly enveloping film-going experience."
The Love Jones comparisons aren't necessarily off as The Photograph probably deserves to be similarly appreciated without the cult classic label this time.

The new creative team effectively taps into a quarter century of real-world affinity from fans for some clever meta commentary within the film.

Entertainingly gritty until an ending that seems to go against all that has preceded it.
"Decent, but not consistently strong and -- at least in the case of our screening -- ruined by an obnoxious audience that didn't fully understand what sort of pic they were really seeing. (Full Content Parental Review also available)"

A thrilling character study but only an average action flick.
"They do get the right actresses for this, though. All three of these women contribute worthy reactions and riffs, though the straw that stirs this drink is Hahn, who is so underappreciated that it's no longer funny."
"So while, similar to the real-life human being it portrays, the movie ""Harriet"" might have its flaws, it is an important depiction for our time: at least as important as a future president's supposed chopping down of a cherry tree."
"This is a gloriously gonzo trip packed with enough odd narrative tangents to fill half a dozen features. While not always successful, this energetic mash-up so genuinely wants to entertain that it's hard not to be won over by its barrage of absurdity."
Goodfellas by way of Wild Strawberries...
"Jamie, Pritti, Hugo, Loco... These figures are designed to appeal to girls, boys and everyone in between. As such, they more than deserve to be the talk of the town."

The 'stars' definitely aligned to make this picture work.

"""A Fantastic Woman"" is above all the story of a woman who loves, loses her love and fights for the universal human right to experience her loss and mourn for it, so that she will be able to get on with her life."
"Loved the complex characters & formulaic overall narrative. It does need some polishing with the action sequences, but the characters & this world (East vs West perspectives) kept me intrigued. I'm looking forward to a possible sequel."
"Even if the movie is less real than it aspires to be, the connection between the two leads feels totally genuine."
"A master class in cinematic formalism, from a man with a lifetime of knowledge and experience."
"I LOVED it. An amazing cast of characters led flawlessly by Daniel Craig, Chris Evans and Ana de Armas. The moment I thought I knew what was happening, a twist threw me. One of my year's favorite films."
"It's as creepy as it needs to be, and not even remotely as creepy as its asinine R-rating would indicate, and it's pretty shallow beyond that."
"Wise beyond her years, [Nika, played by Bronislawa Zamachowska] has a curt, verging on antagonistic relationship with her old man, but she's a ray of light in an otherwise grave endeavour."
Extraordinarily vivid and fresh.
At least in Big Miracle people stop haranguing others across the aisle and start working together.

Even those who don't know a Marvel hero from a DC caped crusader will find themselves having a grand time. That's because Whedon manages to tap the inner fanboy and fangirl dormant in us all.
"One of Mr. Kapadia's most inspired strokes in this valuable documentary is to put her lyrics on screen as she sings them, so we can see for ourselves the essential elements of her songs as they reflected, and intertwined with, her tumultuous life."
What can be said about Concussion outside that it's Will Smith's best performance in years? Too bad it's for a movie mostly plays it safe and isn't as thrilling or biting as it aspires to be.
What a treat it is to discover a totally new actor inside one we already loved. And how sad to know we won't see that from him again.

"There's something achingly liminal about (Lee's) cinema, where the emotions exist in the in-between spaces along society's edges, between words and glances, never fully expressed in words but keenly felt just the same."
"...starts out well enough, with its quirky directorial touches and even quirkier storyline, but finally becomes just too overwhelming."
"Judy dazzles during its musical numbers... [and] Zellweger throws herself into the title role and transcends playing Garland, never falling into camp, or mimicking the singer. She also captures Garland's mannerisms without making them seem fake."
"As in Field's first film, the characters are drawn with such compassion their follies become our own and their desires seem as vast as the night sky."

"By his own admission, Hytner is not a film stylist who can ""think with a camera,"" but he handles Bennett's tales with crisp economy."

Salma Hayek gives the performance of her career in this stealth weapon of a comedy from director Miguel Arteta and screenwriter Mike White.
"Zack Snyder's epic adaptation gives this generation a Superman movie to call its own. Call it ""Superman Begins""."
"The silliest spin-off this side of Elektra, and lots of fun with it."
"Despite its formulaic structure, The Abandoned has a lot going for it. It eschews cheap scares, bloodletting, and gore."
"Moore still hasn't learned some basic rhetorical skills: Will he ever figure out that acknowledging contrary views gives your argument more credibility? But his movie is shocking, poignant and surprisingly entertaining."
"As it is, I admire the brilliance of the majority of this picture to no-end; it's just that pesky literal ending I walked out wanting to declare war on."

"The camera stays on Bannon, and what we see is a man who reveals himself even as he thinks he's gaining the upper hand."
"The film, shot on natural locations in Norway, benefits enormously from the breathtaking beauty of the country, and it looks like a much bigger-budget film than it is."
"It becomes a mesmerising personal vision thanks to Vigo's sophisticated blend of fairy-tale romance, documentary realism, surrealist fantasy, bawdy humour and working-class song."
"A $130 million epic with much to marvel at and great battle scenes, but it dazzles the senses while barely touching the heart."
Pleasure elicits a taunt and razor-sharp depiction of adult film&apos;s dysfunctional climate&#46; 
"The best Ashley Judd movie Judd has never made... a labyrinthine serial killer thriller that won't win admirers for its intellect, but does have sustenance of mood in spades."
"Hanks is being given an awards season push here, no surprise, though he's bound to be hindered by the fact that he makes it all look so easy."
"It's more like an interesting, in-depth article in The New Yorker than a movie."
"Fegley and his character miss it for me because of an innate selfishness in motivation, plus overall meanness to the story's pranks."
A formulaic yet fun adventure.
"Audiences ready, willing and able to find their inner four-year-old may have a decent time at 'Daddy Day Care,' but others are likely to find Eddie Murphy's latest foray into kidpicdom scarcely more amusing than spending 90 minutes in a pre-K classroom."

"Throughout, Judd Apatow dramatizes the ideal of community with an almost Eastwoodian sense of rapture."
The Forgiven takes a while to grab hold&#44; overcoming its awkward and meandering beginning to settle into being a powerful slow burn of a morality tale&#44; delivered with a memorable performance by one of the great actors of our time&#46;
This is heady stuff - a more natural fit for a black-and-white Bergman than a kiddie caper.
"In a year that's seen mainstream cinema struggle to reach any great heights, it's refreshing to find a film that's as engaging and defiantly hard-to-pin down as Elle."
It's a marvelous film. [Full review in Spanish]
"Breathtakingly beautiful, truly magical movie."
"Assayas uses the supernatural to explore grief, and Stewart portrays Maureen's heartbreaking loneliness with skill. She completely carries the film."
"McDonagh explores this village of secrets with tremendous care and craftiness, and provides Gleeson with another stellar opportunity to deliver striking work."
"For people won't have seen the original ""Oldboy"" or anything remotely like it, this will be a rare studio release that feels shocking and abrasive and perverse and in some way new."
"The film actually improves on Cunningham's novel, thanks to gorgeous cinematography, a deft script by playwright David Hare ... a mournful, melodious but never intrusive score by Philip Glass and a superb cast."
"A quietly moving piece of Irish cinema, The Quiet Girl doesn’t wear its heart on its sleeve, but it sure as hell has one."
"There are some impressive special effects, but the picture is more a charming character study than a futuristic adventure."
"The director manages to sustain the film's quirky emotional tone, much more important than sustaining a plot."
Atmospheric and bewitching.
"As bawdy, self-conscious, jaded and still sweetly optimistic as its double-entendre of a title suggests."
What sets Thelma & Louise aside from the great central tradition of the road picture is that the heroes are women this time.

"Deeply frightening, telling a story that could bore into your kids' nightmares if you're not careful."
"It's quite a movie -- atmospheric, obsessive, almost satanic."
One doesn't leave the movie with a mind blown by visual bedazzlement but with a soul shattered by the profound sense of tragedy Linklater and company so beautifully put across.
The connection between Rudy Ray Moore and Eddie Murphy - both in a fictional and real world perspective - is what makes this a rewarding viewing experience.
"It's the blurring of boundaries that makes Wildcat more than just an excruciating series of intensifying scenes of torture, disorienting for the audience as well as the characters."
Danny Boyle's purposeful direction and Mark Tildesley's imaginative and resourceful production design keep this fresh and edgy; the images of a wasted London and the details of a paramilitary organization in the countryside are both creepy and persuasive.
"It wasn't the automatic laughter produced by slam-dunk punch lines, but the laughter of recognition, of insight, even sometimes of squirmy discomfort, as the truths hit close to home."
"Of course it's no ""Chinatown,"" but it is satisfyingly moody and atmospheric."
[H]umanity is what Thor has in spades.
"The majority of the gags, as crude as they can be, hit the mark and the interplay between Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly keeps the film from becoming a repetitive bore."

Mel Brooks was THE comic master of the 70's

"Hackers isn't a very good movie, but it's a darn sight more fun than The Net."
"An uplifting spiritual drama about the value of wonder, the trouble with answers, the constrictions of fear, and the liberation of sharing and caring for others."

"In different hands, Snowpiercer might have been just another generic action movie. Yet with South Korean director Bong Joon-ho at the helm, it's instead something more off-kilter and more disturbingly satisfying."
"Rare is the social satire that rings as true as Network does, and the film is even more topical today than it was thirty years ago."
"If you know any teenage boys with anger issues or a tendency to get into trouble, this movie definitely speaks their language."
"This is a movie about losing one's grip and like any addict's story, it's boring, ugly, sad, and terribly human. And surprisingly funny."
"While ""Kong: Skull Island"" is visual eye candy, its sophistication and excellence negate the fairy tale-magical quality that endeared the original to generations of filmgoers."
"A satisfying and prickly low-key hum of discontent and moral exploration. In Muntean's exhausted landscape, the world wont listen even when its stuck in frozen mud."
"You don't have to be a Star Trek fan to enjoy this rollicking movie. J.J. Abrams' reboot of the 1966 TV space adventure series is fast-paced, action-packed and lots of fun."
"Harold Ramis's direction is nothing special, yet there is a beautiful, lip-smacking efficiency in the way that a great idea is touched off and followed to its conclusion."
"Puppet-master technique and a generally well orchestrated sense of moodiness help this chiller deliver on more than it botches, despite a fumbled third act."
"On display in Poster is the full panoply of pop music's glorious, ego-warped idiocy, from the demented bubble of an entourage to pseudo poses of humility by the famous."
"""You could say that the film is not about anything but, really, it's about everything""."
(Seabiscuit) is a mixed feedbag of hackneyed cliche and inspired drama. In a curious way it has a pace and momentum not unlike a racehorse. It is a slow starter with a pecular gait that rapidly builds up speed and finishes a winner by a nose at the wire.
"They've cranked it up another couple notches for Crank: High Voltage, with mixed results."
[Crowe's] work here is indeed a thing of beauty.
"Suicide is no laughing matter, but there are some wry smiles in this changeably moody indie-pic about self-destructive siblings."
"[I]f you tingle at the sound of metal unsheathing and the sight of flaming arrows whizzing through moonlight, you'll probably be swept away by this shining Knight in amour."
Imagine Austin Powers running into Zoolander at a Black Panthers meeting...

I&apos;m Thinking of Ending Things is one of the best films of 2020&#46;
Phillips directs a pretty entertaining film that is commanded by Phoenix's performance. His commitment to the role is Joker's most compelling aspect and he makes it his own through his physicality and delivery.

"The world needs this movie, and whether you're a fan of deeply personal stories of triumph, or just the Springsteen discography, you'll be absolutely stunned by what this film has to offer."
"Justin McConnell is compelling in his honesty and so obviously in love with his subject. It's a beautiful work about all the hard work that goes on behind the scenes. For film lovers, industry insiders, and hopeful dreamers alike ..."
"""Knives Out"" is as much a 'toon as it is a hat tip to the elaborate mechanics of an Agatha Christie mystery. It's silly and suspenseful in equal measure."
For all its flaws&#44; Elvis remains a remarkably entertaining experience&#44; the credit for which rests largely with its star&#46; Butler is the strongest element film&#44; and the energy with which he infuses the musical numbers is undeniably electrifying&#46;
A bittersweet comedy-drama that manages to be hilarious in one scene and extremely touching in the next.

Jurassic World&#58; Dominion has a terrible script but achieves thrilling&#44; CGI-fueled action&#46; My issues are mitigated by pure entertainment value&#46; Who doesn&apos;t enjoy watching a Pterosaur rip a plane out of the sky&#63;
A captivating blend of razor sharp and perceptive wit and nail biting suspense.
"For its story moment before the gathering storm broke, this film is a garden wall held up, a finger in the dyke, just before the deluge and fall into darkness."
"By no means a masterpiece of the genre, but it's a slickly made picture that more than delivers on the promise made on its poster--oh yes, there will be blood."
"[Notturno is a] film that does not seek to document war atrocities but rather to observe their aftermath, it is an earnest look at those who have been left behind, those whose hearts are bleeding even if they seem to have healed."
"What makes Match Point, a coolly deliberate murder mystery from Woody Allen, so startling is that it feels as if the director himself has been done away with."
"A well-felt celebration of romantic, emotional and physical maturity, filled with laughs and tears. It's also something of a revelation when it comes to Diane Keaton's range."
"Frequency submits itself for our approval as a solid thriller, if not necessarily a timeless one."
Gbravica is a womanly movie in the best sense: [writer-director] Zbanic has a deeply feminine sense of how crisis gets filtered through the moments of daily life.
"Black Hawk Down, boasting the most authentic depiction of contemporary warfare ever filmed, belongs in a time capsule. It's a classic."
"Not as good as it thinks, but powerful filmmaking all the same"
"This is must-see mafia viewing. I would have said this is the best gangster film to come in a long time, but The Irishman beat Mafia Inc. to the punch."
One of the finest acted thrillers ever produced.
"A tragic, soul-crushing experience that - even if admired by viewers - will likely never be revisited again."
"funny and at times wonderfully weird, and even has a few meaningful things to say"
El-Masry transforming Omar's calm dignity into unshoulderable doubt is one of 2021&#8242;s best performances thus far.
Stewart's filmmaking debut showcases his sardonic sense of humor within a story of courage and corruption amid contemporary political conflict.
Discerning travellers and Wes Anderson fans will luxuriate in the glorious Mittel-European kitsch of one of the director's funniest and most exquisitely designed movies in years.
A fascinating and artistically animated movie that's worth seeing more than once.
A powerfully compelling film that gains most of its intrigue via the artifice of purposefully withholding information from the moviegoer.
Exults in its own giddy absurdity.
Welcome To New York will madden many but delight the Big Apple auteur's admirers.
"Jordan always had 6-foot-4 Liam Neeson in mind to play the man they called ""the Big Fellow,"" and it's more than size that makes Neeson fit the part of a leader known for his ""cloudburst temperament."""
"The dialogue is riddled with moody, witty cursing and unequalled wordplay - and all sorts of sarcastic nonsense."
"Solid period piece with good dialogue. Standard relationship stuff, but well done."
&#91;Strickland&#8217;s&#93; films are often creepy if not downright horrific yet can also be perversely funny&#44; both the case with his latest&#44; a film that&#8217;s had me breaking out in giggles for the last 24 hours&#46;
"It's a consistent joy, but it's also unfocused, showcasing Allen's tendency to get lost in unnecessary subplots."
"It seems ageless, despite being set in 2019. This is a future more murky than shining, where hardened men move among the lowlife in a warren of streets lit like an Edward Hopper painting, below pyramid-like skyscrapers."
"Love The Coopers is the perfect gift for the entire family, and that's certainly not a bad thing these days."
Although I would 't say that this is [Wes Anderson's] most successful film... the filmmaker's ability to infect us with that historical moment that none of us lived through is remarkable. [Full review in Spanish]
"The Maels are inherently fascinating subjects either way; the cool, inscrutable centre to Wright's giddy panegyric."
"Wan ... builds the many bumps in the night into a small Hitchcockian symphony of terror by way of long, eerie tracking shots, dramatic silences, and sudden scares that are frighteningly immersive."
"While there's nothing wrong with looking back on 30-year-old Spielberg flicks, or 60-year-old sci-fi B-movies with rosy adoration, doing so to the point of subverting Abrams' own artistic voice mars what might have been great instead of just good."
"He's back! Let the bells ring out, let the choirs of angels sing! Tom Cruise has once again, to the surprise of many, given a great performance."
Mixes fact and fiction to provide a look at Van Gogh&apos;s tortured mental state during his final years&#46;
Avengers: Endgame is not just a remarkable movie; it's an unforgettable experience.

It is the craziest movie you will see all year but it sure held my attention.
"""Quest"" could very easily have been titled ""An American Family"" as well."

Fences has sharp dialogue and excellent performances but it's shot like a play not a movie.
"The animation, a gorgeous blend of bewitching watercolored backgrounds and poignantly rendered characters, is, as ever, beyond reproach."
"Proyas, an assured stylist, manages to elevate the film with a bright palette and an abundance of special effects."
Lamb could be ridiculous... Crucial to preventing this from happening is Rapace's immersion in a character that would seem impossible to perform with conviction and honesty. [Full review in Spanish]
"""Into the Storm"" runs a brisk 89 minutes, and for every second of its running time finds ways to make tornadoes interesting."
"Though the film starts off as a cliché-ridden redemption story, it gets more interesting as Smith quietly drifts into the background and his subjects' lives come into narrative focus."
Superbly acted from top to bottom.

If you're looking to find out how to make an action/spy thriller more than just an action spy thriller then look no further then Hanna.

Anurag Kashyap riffs on a grisly episode of Mumbai history in his luridly absorbing serial killer thriller.
"""If you're gonna tell it, tell it right!""... It could ultimately be the motto for the entire film... but is really concerned with telling uncomfortable truths about 20th-century American social history."
It has many moving moments and some fine acting.
"A tongue in cheek look at Roger Corman's legacy, it's every bit as fun as you'd expect given Corman's oeuvre."
[a] whimsically solid entry. Cuaron creates a Harry Potter universe that is visually more stunning and sardonic in content...a viably entertaining creepy coming-of-age saga

Manages to be a complete winner on every level.

Every child should see it.
Here's hoping Winterbottom doesn't wait another four years before cooking up a third course.
Perhaps the most uninhibited comedy since Helzappopin.
Karyn Kusama's gritty neo-noir crime drama features shades of Kathryn Bigelow and Michael Mann as the City of Angels becomes the backdrop for the riveting crime drama. Nicole Kidman is terrific.
"A work at once intimate, irreverent and respectful, from which unforgettable characters emerge, beautifully shot in black and white and with a soundtrack by DJ Shadow."
The story's slow-burn never quite flares into dramatic wildfire.
The film is worth seeing simply because of the phenomenal acting by the ensemble and a plot that will generate debate and interest once audience members leave the theater.
It doesn’t land perfectly at the end but overall it’s a hoot if you have the stomach for it.
"It's the rare star-driven crowd pleaser smart enough to present more than one idea on-screen at a time, a paean to but also warning against cussedness that manages to exhibit some of its own."
"Adult Adoption is scattered with many... little lessons about connections found in unexpected places without labouring the point, and embraces the often unexpectedly warm messiness of real life."
"A trailblazer for its culture and certainly makes for a fascinating, if rather long, watch."
The core relationship is what makes the movie with this ill-advised title a well-advised choice.
"he visuals are phenomenal, rendered with so much love and passion that each frame is a marvel just to behold."
"Although it is rough around the edges, Spike Lee's passion and intent shines through in Da 5 Bloods, and it is a powerful statement about both the love and hate that undying loyalty can bring."
"This movie is by no means a classic in absolute artistic terms, but as a reaffirmation of all but forgotten verities it's an unqualified success."
Untouchably good.
"As one truly ignorant about haute couture, I am definitely an outsider and not the audience ""McQueen"" is aimed at. That audience will likely enjoy ""McQueen."""
"A visual, aural and emotional feast, storytelling as cinema can best do it."
"Stylistically the film has some terrific moments, oozing period feel."
"Despite having a fairly standard haunted house horror plot, James Wan has created a fun, scary and beautiful looking movie."

"Guillermo del Toro's brutal, breathtaking and magical finest hour is not kid-friendly."
A great scam comedy with Martin and Caine continually trying to top each other. Hilarious from beginning to end.
Russo is a hot-stuff revelation here. It's enough to make Nicole Kidman put her clothes back on.
"Imagine Me & You is... a quietly compelling, heartwarming watch, exactly the kind of thing people have in mind when they say, ""It's a renter."""
"Suburbicon is a dark delight -- a film that keeps you guessing, as well as appalled and amused. And the less you know going in, the better."
A wonder-filled live-action version of the romantic story that also offers us lessons common in good fairy tales.
"The Guest is assured of cult classic status in years to come, but will hopefully entertain the masses with its winning blend of crowd-pleasing humour and suspense."
"Affleck's direction is clipped when the plot requires, but he lingers on character-driven scenes (at a garden, a restaurant, a corner) in no apparent rush. Why hurry, after all? He's arrived."
"Despite its modernist sensibility, there is little reason to be intimidated, unless you find the character of James abhorrent."
"If Jackson had focused simply on Bilbo's party and their attempts to get a proper homeland for the dwarves, 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' would have been a leaner, more engaging tale."
"The musical theme and lovely handmade feel would mark this low-key, indie charmer as This Year's Once, except that Gerard Walsh's minimalist drama is composed of even smaller dramatic arcs and movements."

Sweet and winning and makes us all feel a little better about the world in which we live
"A very southern modern Western, the Spanish-language Sin Nombre offers a treacherous frontier, a conflicted outlaw and fine performances by actors with whom the camera clearly is besotted."
"True, the movie doesn't know when or how to put the brakes on. It does, however, understand precisely what it is."
"The group members' stories are overly familiar to rap fans, as are portrayals of the big bad music industry in general, but that doesn't take away from the film's dramatic tension."
This is Us plays out like a love letter to the cardboard cutouts we frequently see in the background.
"... a smartly made look at an otherwise neglected aspect of film history and culture, packed with colorful stories, witty observations, punky attitude and real history..."
A huge improvement over the middling original...

 &#8220;Your Place or Mine&#8221; isn&#8217;t thrilling&#44; but it&#8217;s easily digestible with capable performances from Witherspoon and Kutcher&#44; who have the advantage of not sharing many scenes&#46;

"[Tyrone Power] has approached the part with the same sincerity and realism that has characterized earlier performances. You won't soon forget Mr. Power as Stan Carlisle, who ""reached too high."""
This movie is entirely fine as an underdog sports movie&#44; even if it&#8217;s got very little new to offer&#44; feeling like a script dug out of the early 00s basket &#40;despite being a remake of 2018&#8217;s Campeones from Spain&#41;&#46;

Leonardo DiCaprio is at his best battling against the elements in this brutal and beautiful snowy western. The grizzly bear attack is worth the price of admission alone.
"Decades after it was made, Lola, Demy's auspicious directing debut starring Anouk Aimee, is just as impressive, lyrical and touching as it was in 1961."
"Helping to make these pleasantries funny is their spur-of-the-moment quality, the same quick spontaneity that characterizes chance remarks overheard at raucous movie houses. Capturing that bright and unexpected quality is what the MST3K crew does best."

"Coogler's realistic debut recreates Grant's final day with affection, refusing to cast him as either saint or sinner."
"Trier plays with formal qualities while also baring dark emotions, Triers style, allusive as literature, elusive as lyrical cinema, is virtuosic but intrinsically ragged."

An imaginative family film featuring a tremendously mischievous and likable lead character.
Very stylish Sicilian mafia movie. One part Antonioni and one part Calvin Klein commercial.

"Leonardo DiCaprio is a nuclear bomb as Belfort, the actor basking in the ridiculousness of his surroundings and eclipsing them at every turn."

"It's cheeky and confident, maybe one of the director's finest, and its loopy final line is the cryptic cherry on this oddball gâteau."
"This is probably Rob Zombie's best film, though it does often prove that the cinephile writer/director is a gifted tyro. At the same time, as his most formally mannered and tonally tempered film, Zombie's latest also proves his versatility."

"It should be essential viewing, particularly in high schools and universities, whence the next generation of policy makers will one day emerge, hopefully more enlightened than we have been."
This is a comedy that recognizes that the wounds inflicted during adolescence run deep and never fully heal.
"It sounds like a depressing little framework, but the actors give it life."
"Don't make your family pay for a death notice in the New York Times. ""Obit"" will inspire you to do something great, which means the paper of record will grant you a free placement."
The movie unfolds in a satisfying slow-burn that makes you feel uneasy until it takes that anxiety and turns it into pure nightmare fuel by making your worst fears real.
"A gorgeously shot, deeply interior portrait of the artist as a young introvert."
"KILL YOUR DARLINGS is really smart, but the movie never feels overly academic. It's too fun and frenzied, beautifully paced."
"Parallels to 9/11, John Ashcroft, the Patriot Act and the rest of the Bush administration's racist thuggery are obvious; the movie creates a stirring tide of activist force."
"No, these things don't all blend together well, but if you can follow Moana's island society's lead and just roll with it, you'll enjoy them one by one."
"In many ways it's a minor film, but it has some insight ..."
A not so bad bromance.
"It's an adulatory recording of the band - that's right, he adores them - but it's much more than that."
"There is something undeniably exhilarating about the film's honest assessment of the never-ending conflict between decency and cruelty that rages in every nation, neighborhood and heart."
"Producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson should be applauded for taking so many bold risks. The gosmacking ending, in fact, may be the biggest in Bond history."
"When a film covers familiar ground, as this coming-of-age story does, it had better offer an original point of view or, at the very least, interesting characters. The Art of Getting By has both, and while it loses its footing now and then, its..."
"Davis' tough, man-of-the-people narration is often annoying, but his words can't diminish the power of his story."
Shin isn't shy about laying on quirky details and oddball splashes to make his third film swing from bizarrely entertaining to dark - though the mystery-solved conclusion feels rushed and is the weakest part of the film.
"Although directed in a pop-smart style that eschews dark, deterministic melodramatics for an unsettlingly sunny tone ... the film also frustrates for having come so close to being something truly challenging."
"Washington directed as well as starred, and it is clear he has no trouble wearing both hats at once"
Burski eloquently conveys the impeccable &#40;but unpredictable&#41; alchemy of the production by underscoring&#44; with frequency&#44; how much of its brilliance was an accidental confluence&#44; how its specific magic was the right combination of people&#44; events&#44; and timing
"With talk about a sequel, it's the perfect time to return to this action-comedy..."
"This story is told with sincerity, heart, and a little bit of magic -- the very same qualities that made the original book a ""you have to read this"" classic for young girls."
The documentary is&#44; like Little Richard himself&#44; colorful&#44; humorous&#44; and wildly entertaining&#46; 
Here is a dark comedy from the great Bong Joon-Ho about class warfare that&#44; depending on your mood&#44; you may find to be a work of genius or too self-indulgent&#46; One thing is certain&#44; you&#8217;ve never seen anything quite like it&#46;

"A bit drawn-out, but Wasikowska and Pattinson are a giddy delight."
George Romero set a new standard for horror with this low-budget opus.
"What does homoerotic vanilla bondage have to do with you? A lot, it turns out."

"A precise proposal that knows how to get the most out of a story with no much news in the plot, but painful and fascinating. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The characters live in a real-world of real circumstances, desires, and danger."
"Comical, colorful, wonderfully cast and beautifully animated, ""Rio"" is the first Blue Sky movie that could be compared to the best of Pixar."
"A Short Film About Killing is as grim as a motion picture gets, but the intelligence and insight applied to its themes will keep the viewer riveted despite the pervasive gloom."
Meirelles paints the squalor and misery of rural East Africa on a striking canvas - sometimes to the disservice of what he wants his film to tell us.
It's a rhapsody on the mystery of simply being alive.
Instead of relying on flashbacks&#44; Causeway lets you see and hear the trauma and raw emotions of PTSD in Jennifer Lawrence&#8217;s expressiveness&#44; physicality&#44; &amp; interactions with those around her&#46; Lawrence and Brian Tyree Henry&apos;s chemistry is off the charts&#46;
An outrageously gorgeous spectacle of balletic aggression.
"There's less than meets the eye to Joachim Trier's Reprise, but the loose, limber visual style gives the picture a certain panache."
The picture is potent and engaging; even its fictionalized elements ring with the spirit of truth.
"Whether or not there is story plausibility here, there is an emotional integrity to every reaction Maisie has to every development."
"If this is the level of arcane mischief Janiak has in store for 1978 and 1666 soon after, then consider this watcher bewitched."
"""13 Minutes"" is a superbly acted and strikingly evocative work, with careful attention to period detail and its many emotional beats."
It is still a solid - and ultimately entertaining - new spin on the beloved tale.
"...an immersive experience, aided by the absence of narration, and Ed Cortes' eclectic soundtrack is the perfect complement to the individualistic characters featured."
"What Le petit soldat, like all Godard's great films, lacks in traditional narrative or aesthetic form it more than regains in its immediacy of thought."
"But eventually, the world has to start moving again. It always does. That's what the movie is about."
Henry Selick’s first movie since 2009’s Coraline. His fifth stop-motion masterpiece.
"Creed II does not give us anything but another, slightly superior Rocky sequel. It wins on points. Just don't expect a knockout."
"I know what you're thinking, but this is no Limitless (Bradley Cooper). As the cells multiply and Lucy taps into more and more of her brain, it's new thrills-new skills with each passing hour."
"Director Fernando Meirelles tells the story with urgency, and his sharp visual compositions and washed out cinematography ooze gangster life."
"""Kajillionaire"" is a rich piece of storytelling, and it feels like a kajillion bucks."
A heartfelt story with a lovely performance from Scott Chambers.
If a bit long for a cartoon feature -- probably a sign that its makers fell in love with it -- Ratatouille is the eighth and one of the best Pixar features.
"Anchored by a charming performance from Greta Gerwig, it's as light and breezy as a walk in Central Park, and just as refreshing."
"It's largely a Hanks solo show, and the beloved icon is in fine, unfussy form."
"It is not one of those family films that will delight both children and adults alike. However, the kids will find it to be entertaining enough."
"The Amazing Johnathan Documentary is ingeniously constructed, a hilarious thrill ride and the underdog story of the year."
A little more conflict and less beatification would have made for a more insightful film.
"17 Assassins is reliably entertaining, but ultimately it's too traditional to be a classic."
The brown-bag movie of the year: Sneak in a bottle of something bitter and cheap (to match the central characters) and get smashed along with the onscreen relationship.
The quirky script is packed with good lines and off-the-wall moments and the stories are surprisingly moving in places.
"It is a model of dignified, delicate restraint but there are times when it seems to suffocate under the weight of its own sumptuous respectability."
The picture fires on all pistons.
I highly recommend you check this out on the big screen.
"Oh it's fun. An old-fashioned, good-hearted action film with a sense of humor."
"Despite its downbeat theme, A Single Man is ultimately optimistic about the human capability to gradually make peace with seemingly insurmountable pain and tragedy."
"Hersh's intelligent style turns a dialogue-heavy, potentially rote film into an enthralling and moving experience."
"It's too bad the movie never quite sweeps us up - it's slow in spots, and there's an awful lot of exposition."
What could easily have become its own figurative image of the masculine longing for freedom mines far deeper concerns.
"Mank isn’t about the incredibly tedious question of who wrote Citizen Kane —that’s the hook, but the film’s true interest, to my immense relief, is the incredibly specific story of Upton Sinclair’s failed 1934 California gubernatorial bid."
A sterling supporting cast -- down to the tiniest bit parts -- provides enough astringent intelligence to make the slobbering sentimentality go down with ease.
Enthusiastically acted and sharply written. A big old lovefest in honor of the classic alien visitation movies that we all hold near and dear.
"The Assistant is a must see, not just because it relates to the behaviour of everyone within the workplace, but because it does so without the need to preach."
It's hard to see how anyone wouldn't be absorbed by this fascinating film about a formidable driver and man.
"The Hate U Give features a strong and incredibly moving performance from Amandla Stenberg, who never holds anything back from the audience and never overplays a moment. She's a star in the making."
The film feels equally drawn out despite the bursts of black humour and the emotional depth of Fan's performance.
"We'd like to take the whole film home, to keep it and cherish its dark wit and intensity."
A seriously quirky piece of work...
An eye-opener that focuses on world-shaking events and makes you feel like you are there.
"Reenactments in documentaries are always a tricky business, but here, they feel necessary. The staged scenes communicate just how visceral mountaineering can be."
"Here, merriment and melancholy go hand in hand, partners in life's dance just as a stiff drink is an accompaniment to life's pleasures. The combination proves as intoxicating as the fancy-pants cocktails the boys whip up together."
"Even though we know the outcome...the campaign progress remains enthralling. Mostly because it's a fascinating snapshot of modern politics in flux...and a hopeful, ultimately moving account of idealism in action."
"The brothers Coen deliver a taut, vastly entertaining dissertation on the imbalance of life."
"Time to Leave blows a fresh, skeptical wind through fairly corny melodramatic territory while keeping faith with the operatic emotions of the genre."
Mild sedative filled with a good run of giggles and the frightening aim of the A-list cast. Nancy Meyers would be wise to keep corralling this type of acting pedigree. It makes her merlot-stained screenplays more palatable than they have any right to be.
A film worth seeing.
"It's a warm, if pallid, romantic comedy that may not do much more to burnish Lopez's reputation, but will certainly not bruise it."
It'll keep the kids entertained for a while and give their parents a chuckle or two along the way.
"It's a worthwhile showcase for Pacino, whose thoughtful portrayal of a washed-up stage actor is both contemplative and darkly comical."
"A stylish, frisky film that sets up the franchise deftly"
"It's a prettified view of love, for sure, but as Sox fans would surely attest, sometimes fairy tale dreams do come true."
"Beast is a strikingly shot, cleverly scripted, unsettling study of troubled psychology in the pressure-cooker claustrophobia of a small island."
"Highly recommended. In a world where the Best Animated Feature Oscar were not basically owned by Disney and Dreamworks, it would be a deserving champion."
"Inside Out's brainy script is matched both by its visual splendor, often invoking the spirit of Miyazaki, and its humanist reach, which extends to both family and (imaginary) friend alike."
"It is not a light movie (as the trailers might suggest), but it's a unique, refreshing one, driven by remarkable performances from Shawkat and Costa."
Remember the name Shohreh Aghdashloo ... she is the soul of this pungent film.
"This is a gorgeous, sweeping entertainment that combines the epic - a rain-whipped ascent through muddy hills is particularly awe-inspiring - with the intimate and the offbeat."
"A feminist chant that's necessary and relevant, a film about female empowerment and their roles in society, the work place and as human beings. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Even when the movie loses its way narratively, Washington's in there, slugging, building a living, breathing character out of Gilroy's knight-errant."
Bong Joon Ho dazzles your senses and infects your mind with a delicious concoction of artful entertainment that delivers a poignant cinematic experience. [Full review in Spanish]
"""American Sniper"" is crammed with action, heart-pounding moments and incredible gunshots by Cooper. But Eastwood seems distracted by his need to make a patriotic film more than a desire to show the real ramifications of so much killing."
"Given it could be re-titled 'Microaggressions: The Movie', this is an unsurprisingly upsetting watch at times, but it's made compelling by Vega's dignified, heartfelt performance."
"The drinks and their consumption look mighty glamorous in ""Hey Bartender,"" Douglas Tirola's tidy and ingratiating documentary ode to high-end mixologists."
"In its own, weird way it resonates, even after a story that some will see as silly and an ending that teeters on gimmicky."
"Pledge is (sometimes frustratingly) ambiguous ... I have to give it credit, though. It's a scrappy little thriller that kept me entertained and enthralled the entire time."
A travelogue with teeth.
"""Don't Look Up"" is no ""Dr. Strangelove"" in achieving lasting political satire brilliance, but it does mirror the times in which it was produced."
"Clarke's specialties are anger and violence, and he captures them with a brutal precision that belies the inherent messiness of the action."
Phil is not a challenging film but it is funny and often sweet.
"""No Time to Die"" is a terrific movie: an up-to-the-minute, down-to-the-wire James Bond thriller with a satisfying neo-classical edge."
... Guédiguian punctures a lot of myths about the face-and the motives-of the French resistance.
"A fascinating, surprisingly funny and extremely moving new documentary about the Apollo space program that really does have the right stuff."
"The Naked Gun is still very funny more than 20 years later. Leslie Nielsen is awesome, and the gags are more hit than miss."
An emotional film that connects with the audience and resembles those epic films full of sentimentalism. [Full review in Spanish]
"Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly."
"Jennifer Garner, in her first romantic comedy, sparkles in this must-see date film."
Tends to get bogged down in an over-abundance of characters and plot developments but does produce enough twists that you never feel cheated by the outcome.
It's almost immediately immersive to be here again... even if it ultimately feels like three quarters of a very good movie chopped off from a whole.
"Set in a place where the American Dream has been dead for so long that no one even thinks to question its loss, the picture features terrific performances from its game cast."
"An appealing comedy with an unabashed streak of melodrama, sharp dialogue, and a superb ensemble cast, anchored by a lead performance by Al Pacino in lovable scamp mode."
... extremely entertaining. [Full review in Spanish]
"In certain circles, it won't be for anyone. But it's as unusual and enigmatic a piece of cinema as you're likely to see this year."
"It's about a boy and his dog, and also about firefighters, and so I don't see how it's possible not to have warm feelings toward it."
"In most years, Naomi Watts would be a shoo-in for an Oscar nomination with a performance that is absolutely mesmerizing and emotionally devastating."
"A morbid, awkward, raucously funny critique of modern life."
As Leopold ... Jackman is the perfect mix of rogue and gentleman.
"A carefully constructed ride of anxiety, in which characters suffer under the voyeuristic eye of the audience and of society as a whole."
"Whatever your take on Showgirls going in, McHale's film will add new layers to it, and make you want to re-watch this fabulously bizarre flop-turned-classic with more questioning eyes."
"An ""edge"" of your seat thriller, perfect for cinephiles who find these moments of our past scintillating."
"It is such a cute movie. It's so adorable, so funny, so sweet. It's corny, but not overwhelmingly corny. It so works."
"Beautifully executed, and marks an impressive debut from Ahn."
"...Drive My Car suggests that, with the right combination of people riding together, you may be able to arrive, intact, somewhere special."
"If your tolerance for envelope-pushing crudeness and deadpan delirium allows it, this crass comedy might be just what the gastroenterologist ordered."
"The magic of “Matilda” is still strong today, and the message it sends out (“You are not alone”) is something we all need to continue to hear."
"...a sunny recollection of an 80's childhood, and specifically a love story between a boy and his aging grandmother, Minari is a feel-good movie with heart..."
Garcia delivers a nerve-jangling tour de force tryout that will be appreciated by out-of-work actors for years to come.
Bound to become THE family entertainment choice for the holiday season. It's a blockbuster. Deal with it.
Downey charms the heck out of the opportunity he's given.
Director Kevin Asch shows a skilled hand that belies his tyro status. He moves the story along briskly and to the point and gets solid performances from his talented cast.
"What to do when a relatively small, modest budgeted urban comedy becomes a massive critical and word-of-mouth hit? Make a sequel to cash in on the phenomenon, of course. It is the Hollywood way, after all..."
"A film that is oh-so enchanting and charming thanks to eye-popping visuals, perfect voice casting and a fantastical story for all ages."
A sinister tapestry of urban unease and feminist fury that turns an ordinary domestic setting into a place of skulking terror. Original and deeply creepy.
Jia Zhangke creates atmospheres and images of great poetic breath that are full of suggestive power and meaning. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Truly romantic movies seem to be a rarer and rarer thing in contemporary cinema and, like Max Ophüls and Jacques Demy before him, Wright is almost peerless in his ability to make an audience swoon and suffer in maximalist splendor."
"Long, lyrical takes - including a startling shot of a floating funeral procession - and Schubert's 'Death And The Maiden' on the soundtrack remind us that forbidden passion will only end in tears. The Danube's rarely seemed so blue."
"In the main, Jaume Collet-Serra is making a character-driven drama about betrayed honor, and the result is a film closer in spirit to the baggage-rich crime novels of Dennis Lehane than dumb multiplex fare."
"It might not be perfect, but this ""Papillon"" definitely has wings."
"A charming, quietly satisfying work, Adam is a commendable film. Sensitively written and directed by Mayer, it's given shape and dimensionality by Dancy, who delivers a tremendous performance that lends the film genuine humanity."
"Thrillingly paced, ravishingly shot and eerily topical, Sicario 2 retains much of its predecessor's dark charm despite its shuffled creative personnel. But a jarringly Hollywood ending dulls its overall impact."
"Hall, making his feature debut, rarely strays from the underdog sports movie template, but the two appealing young leads come as a welcome blast of deodorant to this stale narrative armpit."
"Mary and The Witch's Flower is a colorful and visually stunning spectacle, a film that packs plenty of detail within its frames."
"In truth, mother! can be about whatever you want it to, making it one of those rare films that you can appreciate without actually having to enjoy any second..."
"It's a fierce performance, not because Rodriguez is a seasoned actress -- she's not -- but because she brings such a magnificent, 'prove-it-to-me' snarl to the role."
The script is elegant and the performances are dignified.
The Hughes Brothers have wisely leapt out of their niche by doing this project -- From Hell is a terrific thriller.
"Will lights and hardware be ready? Can they afford the $200K demanded by headliner Rihanna? The viewer's pulse may rise, too, as Rossi's camera roams frantic hallways, offices and limos."
The infamous butt-chugging scene - will do for audiences what the pie-humping scene in American Pie did for the comedy genre.
"Shannon conveys the contract killer's utter detachment from humanity, providing a mute but menacing presence that wastes few words or emotions."
"The Do-Over is a throwback to classic Adam Sandler films and, while ridiculous, is still a fun ride."
"While it's all so breezy and zippy and girl-power peppy, it's Keaton who makes Mad Money worth a few bucks."
"Rather than tell us that everything we know about Oz is wrong, the filmmakers take what we already know about the wonderful wizard and thread it into a tale about the magic behind cinema itself."
"The best thing about Millions is the freckled, open-faced seriousness of young Etel's Damian, a kid whose faith in goodness can't be bought."
"Like many a meal, the lives of these characters don't necessarily turn out as planned, but the surprises are what provide the extra flavor and delight."
It's an airy confection of delight that is at the same time wised-up and nostalgic. And it aims for a vision of moviemaking that is rhapsodic and earnest without being sentimental.
"As a rugged yet wise exploration of manhood and mortality, All Is Lost gives great Hemingway."
"This is no classic, but director James Wan is a deft conductor who orchestrates the scariest ride of the season from threads of familiarly black melodies."
Jenkins&apos; handling of Chiron&apos;s sexuality is as quietly oblique as everything else in the film&#46;
Another 1990s media spectacle gets a long-overdue autopsy in this slick and riveting documentary.
"A cleverly made combination of mystery, drama and thriller which succeeds due to the rapport between Walker and Glackin."
"[Melville's] style remains haunting and elegantly spare, just right for the kind of hit man who lives in silence, in bare and colorless surroundings, with a lonely caged bird."
It's probably the best cartoon that the studio has released since Mulan.
This is a better story than the platitude that it seems to build up to in the final scene. But it was not all the film it could have been if Zemeckis would have realized where his best material lay.
"A perfect date movie with more stars than script appeal... it's contrived and predictable, although there are a couple of surprises"
So what if the front story is a little contrived?
Hedges wraps up a tremendous year with another powerful gut-punch of a performance.
"George has constructed a fine dramatic feature, and a good first step to educating the masses on this disturbing event."
"Across the board, the performances are terrific: superbly understated and fabulously real."
"George MacKay, Lily-Rose Depp star in dark fairy tale that handles a real-life condition - believing you're not human - with sensitivity and empathy."
Zombie proves once again that he understands how many different ways there are to give an audience the creeps.
"Although it’s difficult to place much faith in what she says about herself, there are interesting insights here in terms of what she says about the experience of life within the Daesh state more generally."
Everything played well for me.
"The film eclipses its conceit, delicately examining both the unique pain that is the loss of intimacy and what makes us fall in love with someone again and again."
"Overall, 'Solo: A Star Wars Story' is a great time at the cinema and really gives Han Solo the spotlight he deserves."
"Morgan's sometimes weird, sometimes whimsical thriller delivers a grown-up blend of film-noir tropes and deadpan humor, for a comedy-drama which starts off lighthearted and then deftly darkens."
"Bergman Island thrums in silence, so it loses steam when, during the second half of the film, reality and fiction begin to explicitly mix. [Full review in Spanish]"
"""On the Beach"" feels more raw and personal than some of Mr. Hong's other work."
Thorough and essential.
"A reminder that Gondry is as brooding as he is silly, even when making an outlier like 'Microbe & Gasoline.'"
Excellent option if you want more than entertainment from... two hours of cinema. [Full review in Spanish]
The Hustle doesn't have a grand message and it doesn't need one. It's two top-notch comedians trying to steal the movie from one another. They both win.
"The film moves on the strength of its aesthetic wonder, almost as if you are watching a feature film made entirely of Tumblr-based gifs and mood boards."
"Skate culture remains in solid hands with filmmaker Stacy Peralta, who fashions his most personal doc on the sport-cum-lifestyle."
"F. Gary Gray's excellent film is as sympathetic as it is bombastic, even when it depicts some of the rough stuff, a lot of the stupid excesses that come with fame, and even some quasi-criminal activities."
"A powerful tale of bravery, compassion and resilience, The Cave is a remarkable film."
A sober and impecable tale. [Full review in Spanish]
[Huppert] manages to make Hansen-Løve's sometimes flat writing come alive at the right moments.
"A fun, energetic caper that tries hard to make you love its characters, but mostly fails to succeed.."
"Though Penn's sympathies lie with McCandless, the director's camera is impassive, and the film's driving intent is to doggedly document rather than celebrate."
Save for two sequences where Sony Pictures' take on the jacket-wearing hopper mirrors Beatrix Potter's ... the film operates between fourth and fifth gears.
The actors' hammy performances only compound the amusement of watching a dynasty propped up by largesse fall to pieces at the very thought of actually having to earn their way in life.
"(Writer-director Patrick) Wang's deliberate, naturalistic style proves to be both a strength and a weakness. In the final analysis, the overall timeliness of Wang's storyline as well as the film's lack of sentimentality is of considerable value."
"Alas, the out-on-the-town portion of the movie is less engaging, although if you're a Smiths fan you can happily rock out to the greatest-hits soundtrack, which has everything from the title track to Panic, Girl Afraid and How Soon Is Now."
The performances are great from top-to-bottom...this was a movie that probably should have been on the big screen.
"It's nervy stuff for any filmmaker but especially one who loves to imbue a sense of melancholy amid the hopeless. For Nightmare Alley, there is no sweet, only bitter."
"A confidently handled, promisingly edgy feature debut...Winter Brothers dribbles into obfuscation its closing stages but has already confirmed Palmason and company as names to watch."
Ozon knows his female characters like few others. [Full review in Spanish]
...a high concept premise that's employed to somewhat bloated yet predominantly entertaining effect by Badham...
As much a loving homage to the horror genre as it is a lament for a civilization on the brink.
"Amin's story is so thick with drama, terror and bloodshed, why create a fictional character to serve as a vantage point?"
"It's a gorgeous, thoughtful, well-acted, morally complex and adult-skewing character study from a major studio. Warts and all, it's exactly what we say Hollywood never bothers to make."
"Joseph Hader breathes life into his role with a raw, understated performance that somewhat compensates for the screenplay's lack of emotional depth."
"It rollicks along with a lot of help from the songs, which lift the spirits as well as lending pace to the plot but the insistence of the message-making means Cinderella and her Prince fall short of making magic together."
"'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness' clearly bears the fingerprints of director Sam Raimi, who infuses the material with the same trippy, giddy spirit which has guided his best work."
English film that powerfully and practically speaks to the communal dimension of our responsibility to the natural world.
"Eggers has solidified his legacy as a wonderful director and there are no doubts, he will be making movies, possibly even Oscar worthy ones, for many years to come."
"Life Animated, is a heart-warming, honest and thoughtful film about how a family made magic out of adversity."
Thinking back on &quot;Suspiria&quot; yields sense memories&#44; electronic haunted-house sounds&#44; stylish and outr&#233; brutality&#46; It&apos;s possible to forget Harper is even in it&#44; but it&apos;s not possible to forget the opening salvo of operatic violence&#46;
Here you get a rare glimpse of exactly what the interface between a West Bank resident and the Israeli army has been like ...
"The audiotapes are the treasures: They resurrect Wilson as a warm, amicable presence. It's almost if Wilson had -- dare we say it? -- invited us pull up a stool to join him for conversation and a (non-alcoholic) drink at a friendly bar."
"The Mojo Manifesto: The Life and Times of Mojo Nixon is a riot, especially for fans, or a good primer for those who don’t know him."

Chris Columbus' only good movie.
"Shawshank aside, this is the best non-horror Stephen King adaptation of the bunch."
It has to be admitted that Scott and his team have retained their ability to make the flesh crawl.
"Very much a character-driven piece, which not only makes the laughs bigger but also earns a deeper involvement."
"Sparse, uncompromising and bewitching. Reichardt has stripped back all but the bare essentials, scattering the characters across the sun-bleached landscape like marbles."
"Kapadia refuses to glamorize Winehouse's addiction as a casualty of rock 'n' roll or just another entry into the ""27 Club."""
"The most ambitious and impressive Coen film in at least a decade, featuring the flat, sun-blasted landscapes of west Texas and an eerily memorable performance by Javier Bardem."
"There's something amiably Quixotic about this recklessly dangerous flight, something innocent, and the vistas of the 19th-century London landscape are really quite something."
"The movie feels uncompromised, genuinely transgressive at times, and smart in the ways it entertains."
Fresh transitions from simmering romance to boiling carnage and in doing so becomes a deliciously moreish movie morsel.
"It's possible to be genuinely moved by that reckoning - and to admire the obvious intelligence and care that have been brought to bear on ""Stillwater"" - without fully buying the trail of contrivances and compromises it leaves in its wake."
"Structurally and tonally, the third act is a challenge. But the longer I linger on it, the more I admire the risk taken by McCarthy."
"There's a heightened edge to I, Daniel Blake, an embittered streak of comedy that keeps the otherwise miserable plot from weighing too heavily."
Even the most televisionally overstimulated will likely enjoy this boy-and-his-dog movie -- which also happens to be a girl-and-her-cat movie too.
"When the visit ends, one is grateful simply to have been in their esteemed company."
"More than a decade after The Blair Witch project turned the mock-doc format into a horror cliche, this low-tech horror show uses it to chilling effect in this story of cynicism vs. things that go bump in the night."
"Opening in domestic contentment, moving through personal anguish and ending with a cosmic lament, it's a simple, wrenching story of love and loss that pries open a window onto eternity."
"It's a fascinating news story, but the film's additional, if entertaining speculations remain just that."
"You will come to think that it's Fate itself that's ultimately imposing itself on its objective, obscuring a present that should be bright. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Mills tells his story with a glancing quirkiness, both affectionate and meandering."
Ruzowitzky depicts the care and attention to detail that went into the operation.

A hobo hops off a freight train in a nameless North American Gomorrah run by a sadistic crime king. Then said hobo cleans up the place by shooting buckets full of guts.
"Has the slow-pulsing vertigo of a psychological thriller & the twists of an elaborate melodrama, but to reduce it to these labels is glib. Caustic & funny but never misanthropic. A study of the ways people actually live, rather than how we assume they do."
Law's committed performance is the biggest selling point for the inconsistent movie.
The imagery on display is amazing&#44; and its power frequently overtakes the screenplay&#46;

Craggy. But worth it for the views.

The final moments of Bad Hair are as fiercely emotive as Truffaut's fabled still-shot ending for 400 Blows. This is grand cinema.
If you don't see yourself in its depiction of intense emotion I both envy and pity you.
Scorsese leaves us pondering: How far can organized religion sustain us in the face of oppression? When does pure faith kick in? And does that belief suffice?

It is the thematically-rich storytelling that makes &apos;Halloween Ends&apos; truly special&#46; Making a film  that is supposed to end an iconic horror-thriller franchise character-driven&#63; It doesn&apos;t get ballsier than that&#46;
This lively animated adventure keeps us entertained even if the story and characters aren't particularly well-developed

A surprisingly real male relationship examination.
An exciting&#44; educational and entertaining film&#44; set to instil wonder in audiences of just about any age&#46;
"2007's cool psychological suspense piece Yella, with Hoss as a woman who can't quite escape her troubled past, was one of the first films that made the international reputations of both its star and her frequent director Christoph Petzold."
"This pared-down film version mostly captures the stormy symphonic interplay of nasty recriminations, mocking taunts and hurtful revelations hurled with corrosive aplomb by a top-notch ensemble of actors."

"Hustlers is brash, often crude and unabashedly chaotic, but it is its ""buddy movie"" sensibility which ultimately wins the day. A robustly made, beautifully acted and decidedly engaging story about some unlikely heroines."
An almost unimaginably thrilling experience.
"A bespectacled, bow-tie wearing beagle with a genius IQ and a penchant for terrible puns... Erudite, pedantic, prissily formal, he sounds a lot like Niles from Frasier but he'd make a great Dog-tor Who."
Writer/director Jason Orley's debut is funny ... but it's also surprisingly insightful about why these characters do the things they do and let it get so out of control...
"At the end of the day, while unnecessary, ""Army of Thieves"" thrives because Schweighöfer's go-for-broke attitude pushes this overlong, low-stakes, heist caper into the realm of enjoyability."
"Although Hall's impressive debut is about very specific people in a particular place and time, the questions it raises and the experiences it dramatizes are broader, more universal."
An absolutely heartbreaking tearjerker...
"...a brilliant, precise cast. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Overall, Arctic Tale's one true message is clear: Stop global warming before it's too late."

[A] joyfully oddball work about friends who aren't your friends and the price one young couple must pay for always being happy.
"When Stone finally achieves a comfortable balance between the pretty young things and the cornucopia of crazies, the film truly comes to full life as the lurid, down and dirty entertainer one hopes for."
"Even though it's not exactly easy to watch the protracted deaths of two children, this is not only one of the greatest anime ever, but also an important (anti-) war film. A moving masterpiece."
"Here, Jeunet’s bright colors and prankish manipulation of space makes a suburban home and its lookalike environs an appropriate carnival atmosphere. Big Bug turns a spiritual and political pandemic into a three-dimensional funhouse mirror."
The story sets out to be that whimsical escapist romance with a European setting where love and heartbreak span decades in that mystery format. Director Augustine Frizzell pulls out all the stops at making this film the unabashed epic romance that it is.
"The feel-good story and sing-along production numbers are likely to please the movie's target audience of tween girls, but there's not a whole lot in ""Annie"" to win their parents over."
"Egerton is so gosh-darn sweet as the skier, and Hugh Jackman makes such a swell jerk as his trainer, Bronson Peary, that you'll take the ride with them anywhere"
"Enough cannot be said about the sharpness and intelligence of Ade's script, and how credibly it sketches the connections between its superficially disparate co-protagonists."
"Don't be surprised if you shed a little tear in Miss Potter. This enchanting biopic about the world of the creator of Peter Rabbit is warm and funny, revealing and moving."
The film...is more interested in the waywardness of almost everyone's longings and in their failures of self-preservation than it is about Lulu's particular immorality or recklessness.

A bold exploration of some of the challenges faced by investigative journalists in an age of dirty politics.
Disney should celebrate the day they first teamed up with Jon Favreau as a national holiday.
Coda isn't merely a feel-good movie; it's the pinnacle of a new wave of post-Donald Trump cinema that can only be described as 'happycore'.
"On the plus side: the battle scenes, brilliantly filmed with a hand-held camera; a remarkable portrayal of a sadistic English officer by... Donald Sutherland; and clever art direction... On the debit side is Al Pacino's ludicrous performance."

"It likely won't receive all the Oscar hoopla that many are expecting, [but] American Gangster is one of the first films of the year to actually deserve the recognition."
The veteran director has gifted us with yet another tantalising&#44; transcendent exploration of the consequences of our endless attempts to modify our sacks of flesh in order to feel something&#46;

Yonebayashi's unwavering faith in the clear values and direct narrative structures of a good storybook energize his rousing entertainment with sweep and drive.

"By the time the film gets where it's going, viewers may identify more than they expect with those who've been controlled by others with hidden agendas."
"Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris movingly weaves a tale about finding an outer beauty that reflects the purity of heart within. It’s as pleasant as you want a movie like this to be, yet it does so without simplification that patronizes the audience."
"Happily is a dark comedy with an all-star cast of characters, building tension in a wound up house of deception, boiling over into a wild and weird getaway."
What makes Depp so incredible as an on screen presence is his generosity. He hardly commands the screen as much as he shares it with his co-stars.
There&#8217;s nothing didactic about &#8216;T&#225;r&#44;&#8217; nor any simple moral you can hashtag or put on a bumper sticker&#46; The film is complicated&#46; Difficult&#46; Much like its protagonist&#46;
"Detachment is a powerful, incisive and emotionally stirring film that provides keen insight into an over-saturated topic."
"Django is infectiously rousing and exuberantly subversive. Say what you will about his insensitivities, nothing in Tarantino's approach is condescending or pretentious."
I've been sold on the rich possibilities of these new movies. I'm letting the Force in this time.
A compelling report.
"There are a few wrong notes, and the ending is too enigmatic for its own good, but for a studio production the film is uncommonly intelligent and uncompromising."

...a surprisingly touching drama about finding that balance between our past and present selves.
A medley of familiar Christmas classics...with a distinct Muppet spin.

Ace in the Hole does for print media what Network and Nightcrawler would do later on for television and it still rings true today.

&#8220;Goodnight Mommy&#8221; is a roll of the dice&#46; If the premise intrigues you&#44; you&#8217;re taking your chances&#46; Nicely shot and paced&#44; it will hold your interest&#44; but it is the ending that will determine whether you consider it time well spent&#46;

Steven Spielberg's best movie in at least a decade.
Explores with creative and comic energy the difficulties of the sibling bond and the mixed feelings we often have for those who share our history.
"Walt Disney has no peer in the field of animated features and his latest, based on the familiar King Arthur legend, is brimming with mirth, music and magic."
"It's all tease in the first half, and all implausibilities in the second. Still, Thomas is always worth watching, in French or in English, whether her mood be chilly or tropical."
An essential documentary that helps explain today's politics (and perhaps tomorrow's) around the world. [Full Review in Spanish]
"This imbalance in the screenplay keeps Far From Men from its chance at greatness. Nevertheless, its strong stance of taking the side of humanity, even in the face of a civil war in which sides are expected to be taken, deserves respect and applause."
This is the kind of intimate little indie that I wish we got more of.

"Communist Poland in the 1950s is a frigid land of slippery political sands in director Pawel Pawlikowski's graceful, gorgeously retro, black-and-white dedication to his parents."

"Haunting and ominous, written, directed and acted nearly to perfection."
"Deftly directed by Stephen Frears, the film is funnier than you might expect. The opening sequence alone is a mini masterpiece of pacing. And Dench gets to show enormous range."
"Casino Royale is the riskiest of Bonds, and it immediately establishes itself among the series' top tier because almost every gambit pays off."
"Like 'The Lord of the Rings,' 'Spider-Man' is grandly, emotionally affecting in a way that it had started to seem that Hollywood blockbusters never would be again."
"Demonstrates how homage can provide the undercurrent for a films visual and narrative language, yet go beyond simplistic checkboxing of references...Plays like a cold winter storm with occasional gusts punctuating the biting, incessant frigidity."
"Quincy is lovingly put together and recounts one of the most distinguished and interesting careers in American entertainment. However, it's almost too much to fit into a single movie."
"This sequel to the Kingsman: The Secret Service (based on the comicbook series) veers in several directions, but the last half hour when things come together, more than makes up for the wait."

a complex plot that manages to balance character writing with slam-bang action sequences

Logan is a dark and thrilling finale for Wolverine. Director James Mangold brings stark realism to the comic genre.
"On a whole, it's still fun and cute."
"What remains is a fascinating, Kafkaesque portrayal of justice (or lack thereof) in modern China, but it's no knee-slapper and, at more than two hours, it's long for a comedy."
An eerie and intimate psychological thriller with Hitchcockian tones harkening back to the Shyamalan's early 2000s run that put him on the filmmaking map.
"A round of hide and seek with some blue bloods gets, well, bloody in the very funny horror-satire Ready or Not."
"To a tale which is, happily, naughty but nice about love and marriage and set with wistful witty tunes and recitatives, Vincente Minnelli adds his own special touch of sophistication and burlesque at the expense of the period's fashions and manners."
"Funny, sad and bittersweet - one of Noah Baumbach's finest."

It&#8217;s been years &#8212; maybe as far back as &#8220;All the President&#8217;s Men&#8221; in 1976 &#8212; that a movie has captured the craft and the passion of journalism as precisely and as smartly as director Maria Schrader&#8217;s &#8220;She Said&#46;&#8221;
"Love and Honor is a welcome affirmation of Yamada's determination to maintain his historic workload, even while in his 70s."
"A magnetic, brilliant and captivating film where the director knows how to tense the threads that unite the imagination of the spectator with the imagery of distant worlds. [Full review in Spanish]"

"While it lacks outright Cronenbergian pleasures, ""Maps to the Stars"" repeatedly connects as a dark comedy and insidious display of rancid human behavior."
Strangely inert and lifeless.
Johnstone&#8217;s film revels in the humor of its premise complete with pop songs and children&#8217;s toys gone awry&#46;
A striking phantasm of affection&#44; regrets&#44; and remembered accounts that might be factually inaccurate but emotionally unfeigned&#46;
"Disney's multi-Oscar nominated musical is not as good as Mary Poppins to which it's often compared, but Angela Lansbury is well-cast and most of the visual effects, which won the Oscar, are impressive."

"Eastwood takes the film in some interesting directions by sticking to documented facts, zeroing in on Richard's reluctant decision to fight back against the system he loves..."

"The outrage of actor-turned- writer-director Peter Mullan is palpable, and every frame of this shocking and occasionally exploitative film is designed to ensure that this reaction is contagious."
"Williams delivers a solid, twinkle-free (though closed-off) performance, but the film as a whole can't decide what it wants to be."
A passable yet underwhelming sequel...
"It will make you feel wonderful, and if you're like me, whose emotional barometer responds in the positive with tears, take plenty of tissues."

A complex film about the minefield of loyalty and betrayal.

[Hugh] Grant is a hoot throughout as he channels vintage Michael Caine for equal parts menace and camp.

As a snapshot of an age and life stage&#44; Trier helms a film that&apos;s canny and incisive&#44; also perfects the sensation of constantly zipping onwards even when it seems as if you&apos;re stuck&#44; and knows how to find both joy and darkness in tandem&#46;
"Sang-ho can't quite resist a last-minute lurch towards sentimentality, but for the most part he keeps this moveable feast for the undead on track with relentless and bloody carnage."

"""The Signal"" is a sci-work of thoughtful hints and feints, but the movie's big reveal raises as many questions as it answers."
"What Days offers is an incredibly realistic, near-documentarian sketch of two ordinary lives that informs you of the characters' circumstances and emotional state without telling you anything."
"We are definitely on familiar, well-travelled ground, which explains why the visually impressive Reminiscence is good but falls well short of great."
"At the movie's climax, they [the actors] bring new life to liberte, egalite and, of course, fraternite."

"It's a combination of nostalgia, good vibes and even a bit of ""you can't reheat a soufflé,"" but if you loved the first one you'll connect to this sequel. Wesley Snipes is rad!"

Anderson skillfully dissects the idea of the New York intellectual bourgeoisie and examines the growing void between families.
"Clearly, del Toro has a deep affection for both his characters and the world of gods and fairy-tale monsters, and it translates into a rich, sophisticated sequel that actually improves on the original."
"Blow the Man Down is a strong showcase for older female character actors. In most movies, performers like Squibb, Martindale and O'Toole would maybe get to steal a few scenes. Here, they're the main attraction."
Spike Lee using his white voice - for subversive purposes.
Features a great performance from the Danish actor Jesper Christensen.
Need escape? Logan Lucky is for you.

"This film bites with all of its teeth. It's an exercise in a certain level of brutality that we seem to reserve for those we know the best -- our family, our friends, our neighbors."
It's wicked and cynical and I suspect Hollywood will want to remake it but will strip out its acidic nature.
"Exquisite on every level, Dreamchild is a film to cherish."
"It feels like one of those live-action Disney features that were so prevalent during the 1970s -- one could easily picture Jodie Foster as the prepubescent heroine, Dean Jones as her bumbling uncle, and Don Knotts as the supremely self-satisfied villain."
"Among the more unique, one-of-a-kind movies of the year. And I'd love to see a where-are-they-now sequel in a few years."
Godzilla Vs Kong delivers action and spectacle by the bucket load and will leave anyone who wants to see a giant ape hit a giant lizard in the face with an axe very satisfied&#46;
"The movie's ending will not satisfy everyone, but it does avoid typical Hollywood conventions. Whether it is the correct finale is something you will have to search your own heart to answer."
"An Inconvenient Sequel comes close to sanctifying Gore; while he says he sometimes views the lack of global progress on climate change as ""a personal failure,"" the film never encourages us to agree with him."
A United Kingdom never sacrifices its narrative in favor of making a statement and it rarely resorts to sermonizing.
"One of the most technically impressive films of its time, and one of the most politically naive."

"[Alexander] Payne is aided greatly by [George] Clooney, whose befuddled expressions should be engraved in the cement at Grauman's Chinese."
"At its heart, Shazam is a movie about making your own family, bridging the gap differences seem to make, and having a good laugh while you do."
The tone of the movie is cheerily macabre.
"A cross-generational character comedy whose biggest problem is its characters, Noah Baumbach's While We're Young is sharply observed but frustratingly slight."
1960s-set family drama tackles weighty issues.
Oakley has crafted a sad and shrewd film about the loneliness of hiding your true self and the inherent evils of compulsory heterosexuality&#44; especially under the guise of &#8220;protecting children&#46;&#8221;

"Director, Scott Hicks has created a really lovely film. It's fortunate that the star power of Clive Owen gives the film a core dynamism."
"... The film’s writer-director, Colm Bairéad, shows how a well-judged movie can come near to corniness but still be deeply poignant. "
"For casual race fans, Racing Dreams is a real eye-opener. And it's a darned entertaining way to get a handle on a sport that can seem like a bunch of cars doing circles for a crowd that seems most interested in seeing that next epic wreck."
"It's essentially a soundtrack -- and a good one at that, led by Timberlake and Anna Kendrick, with contributions from Gwen Stefani -- in search of a story."
"Though not without striking qualities by itself, it serves best as a poignant stepping stone to the auteur's later, more famous projects."
"A twisty, chilly vision of haute-yuppie parenting as unrelenting nightmare, an ingenious reworking of the demon-seed genre in which the evil child is not the real villain."
"A goofball riff on the pirate-movie genre, this sequel is as insubstantial as popcorn -- and as delicious."
"Cloying smart, gleefully mischievous and resplendently, stupendously gross."
"Not Okay is like many “internet movies” before it – approaching uncanny valley, somewhat obvious, just a little off — but this unsettling darkness makes it a solid entry into the canon of just-okay social media films."
I'll Sleep When I'm Dead may take its place with Get Carter as a classic British gangster film.
It's a very sly piece of filmmaking.
"This is the arid equivalent of Werner Herzog's Aguirre, Wrath of God. Reichardt offers the minimum of genre conventions and none of the genre's satisfactions or resolutions."
"Any frustration is neutralized whenever Krieps is onscreen. The actress plays Chris as beguilingly childlike, her feelings and impulses... right at the surface, intensifying and subsiding, arpeggio-like."
"Enraging, and eye-opening, the beginning of the antidote for how black women's lives get erased in America. Tells a story that we should recognize as epic."
The film can jar when oscillating between the CG-realised worlds and sequences with actors playing non-Na&#8217;vi characters&#44; but for the most part The Way of Water is a sumptuous visual tapestry&#46;

"Transcendent and absorbing, depicting our place in the universe with ferocious honesty and unflinching strength."
"The Sacrament is worth a watch for fans of the director and cast, but its lack of purpose or anything to say limits its staying power dramatically."
"Wong made Chungking in just 23 days, and the film's mad-dash energy is nicely reflected in his quartet of stars. Wong, himself a star of cinema's future, has already shown that he possesses a uniquely '90s voice, eye and spirit."
The best horror film since The Blair Witch Project.
"What starts out as a freak show ends up a poignant tale of tragedy, redemption, and the boon of taxidermy."
intelligent and very well-acted
"An inspiring, fun documentary."
Deep Impact hits the bull's eye for sci-fi action thrills and the sheer power of an engrossing adventure that marries plausible ideas with a jump into the beyond.
"Though it may seem Biller is mountain an assault on delightfully garish exploitation fare - with overemphatic titles like ""Vixen!"", ""Score!"" and ""The Lickerish Quartet"" - that's not quite what she's doing."
"Suffers the same problems that most sitcom to movie adaptations suffer from, but fans of the series should find lots to love."
"The satire's still there, albeit not as angry and more obvious, and the targets have shifted. It may not have the original's subversive nutso attitude but there's a couple of crazy surprises up its sleeve and a surprisingly engaging story."
A feat of photography.
"Corseted courtesies and the candlelit rooms with their flickering pools of light never overwhelm the story's contemporary resonance. The clash of male assumption and jealousy, and female wiles and independence, has no shortage of present-day parallels."
"A thoroughly enjoyable film with a lot to like about it, even if you're not a fan of 'The Boss.'"
"Be it Panda-Rific, Perfectly Panda or Panda-monium, one thing is for certain when we're talking about Kung Fu Panda 3 - It's the Best.Panda.Ever."
"Efficient, well-crafted and solid to a fault, The Finest Hours might have been made 30 or 70 years ago, and starred Gary Cooper or James Stewart -- it's profoundly old-fashioned but pretty enjoyable for all that."
"This is meaty, dramatic stuff - see this movie with your teenagers and watch their jaws hit the floor -- and the filmmakers cannily use President Nixon's secret tapes to bolster their case..."

"It's a fascinating puzzle: a film that is simultaneously an indictment of the toxic legacy of cultural imperialism and a weepie that employs the familiar tropes of Hollywood, one of the biggest machines of cultural imperialism on the planet."
What's funny about exploitation? You'd be amazed.
"One of the two very smart things that the film does is to keep the original 1975 setting, as the story would have been altered far too much to be set in the digital age."
"Clooney is remarkable in Alexander Payne's film about loss, confusion and getting by."
"Republican, Democrat, or Independent, the only side THE REPORT chooses is the fight for human rights."
"The intelligence and wit of this glass-slipper heart-of-gold fantasy are shocking too, but hell hath no part of the surprise.  "

The film is a strictly no-bull proposition.
"It's a film worth seeing just for the story, but with the superb performances, it makes a film you need to see."
"Hoffman and Cruise give signature performances in this thoughtful, and hugely enjoyable, classic."
"Labaki's realistic camera following Zain, whose family is undocumented migrants, takes viewers into the heart of a very real, universal issue, no, not about refugees, but the problem of unfit parenting."
"Ostensibly a comedy about inspiration and creativity, The Muse is a clunker that's actually painfully lacking in both qualities."
"[Abdel] Kechiche knows his subject and the film reflects the warmth and understanding with which he views it, though it is inordinately long at 2 hrs and 30 minutes."
"Shows that it's not only possible to make a spine-tingling World War II saga without bloodshed, but also to use such stories to examine the agonizing-but-necessary values of conscience, loyalty and forgiveness."
"An attractive, energetic young cast and some witty, off-center visual humor make the resultant laughs more than worth the wait."
"With so many ideas in play, the film is never dull. Sometimes it's also funny, perceptive and nuanced. Things get deeper and dirtier as it rolls on, but not really clearer, in terms of purpose."
"Mary Poppins Returns is solid, reliable family fare and only the hardest heart will leave the cinema bereft of a smile. It might not be another classic, but it's brolly good fun."
"It's a film that is very much in the tradition of British social realism. Nonetheless, it remains light and joyful enough to be enjoyed and recognised by an audience with the same demographic and age as the characters on screen."
"While watching ""Gold,"" I felt I had seen the story before. And, I realize that I had, many times and ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" comes to mind - without Bogey and bandits that ""don't need no stinking badges."""
"For me, Ferrara and Keitel will always be the bad lieutenant, but Werner Herzog is probably the only director qualified to take this on, and his bizarre reboot has a fascination all of its own."
"What it all amounts to is a tremendously funny feel good film that doesn't quite stand on its own so much as it plays as a great (the BEST, really) companion-piece to The Room that a cult film fan could ask for."
The film set a strong tone for modern summer blockbuster films in 1993 and continues to be one of the most iconic movies ever to hit a silver screen in the summer months.
a cheerfully silly caper comedy that mixes in a little of 'My Fair Lady' and a lot of 'The Honeymooners' as it breezes along. ...Allen and Tracey Ullman spar and slander each other with an almost maniacal glee.
"Nicely composed and played with an endearing sense of Hitchcockian humour, Grand Piano is well worth a tinkle."
Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium should delight audiences in the mood for holiday magic.
"Writer-director Chloe Zhao works methodically to set up Johnny's situation, while also capturing in poetic detail the dead-end lives of poverty, alcoholism and hopelessness on the reservation."

This British import is a good-natured comedy featuring several laugh-out-loud sequences.
"This is not just fan service replaying the moments we already know and love. The film actually finds a way to authentically transpose similar moments of humor and heart into a more mature, introspective adult version of the protagonist. "
That Coppola finds occasional grace and spirit here shows understanding and compassion. Her next assignment? Make a movie that's not about the troubles of the privileged and bored.
"Succeeds, perhaps too well for us to believe Hitler was some aberration who could never happen again."
"The plot is ludicrous but one doesn't go to Luc Besson action films for character-driven storytelling; they go for exactly what this film promises and delivers -- frenetic, inspired, grin-inducing action."
"What struck me in now is that it eschews the plot, and going off into flights of comic fancy including re-doing the ending a couple times until theyre satisfied. The result is still funny, still EXCELLENT and SCHWING! Two on-air reviews in one link! "
"If these movie cops were your local police, you'd want them strung up on charges and locked away. In a fictionalized past, sure, it's still amoral, but that would only be a problem if the movie ever took itself seriously."
"A streamlined, ""Reader's Digest"" version of real-life events. However, it is a gorgeous, worthwhile re-telling thanks to a fine cast; top-notch art direction; a beautiful, mostly piano score by Stephen Warbeck; and Gabriel Beristain's ravishing cinematog"
"It's entirely ridiculous, but it gallops cheerfully along; everything is carried off with flair and ingenuity."
"There's enough juice to sustain a fan's interest for awhile. It ain't much, but watching Scully and Mulder inch closer romantically, and seeing some cool special effects is worth the price of admission."
"As comfort-blanket romcoms go, it is the rare one that will not bring you out in a rash."
"A languorous, visually striking movie about love and loss, infused with the earnestness of young people struggling with powerful emotions and with evolving ideas about life, death, art, freedom and responsibility."
The flashy style cannot hide the slight story.
Foreign-film comfort food...at its best in exploring the psychology of the adopted.
"Without a musical soundtrack and through elongated fixed planes full of internal rhythm, the film is the perfect weapon against the apostles of moral superiority. [Full review in Spanish]"
[Collette] proves herself worthy of carrying a movie with a performance that runs the gamut of human emotion without striking one false note.

&#91;Newell and Attanasio&#93; pay as much attention to emotional details as to the clockwork details of mob life&#46;
"As a showcase of the limitless power of the imagination, Paprika never fails to delight the eye and engage the mind. We are never sure exactly whom we should be cheering for, or even if we're rooting for real characters or their avatars."
"As a horror movie, ""Brightburn"" gets the job done but in strange ways."
"There is nothing left for the critic at this point but to corroborate all that has been said of it, to add his own warmest words of acclaim"
"Undoubtedly a stylistic achievement and a complex, troublesome statement on sexual politics."

"In a swift 86 minutes, director Meadows and co-writer/star Considine give us a methodical, handsome, emotionally intelligent version of the revenge flick."
"Its mock-artistic thriller trappings notwithstanding, 'In Bruges' is basically a funny, tragicomic two-hander, with the casting of Farrell alongside Gleeson enabling a pleasing Irish inflection."
"A competent genre movie enlivened by vivid sense of place/culture - shot on location in New Orleans, delving into the world of merchant seaman/dock workers/smugglers."
"Treating his seafood substantially better than Oldboy, Jiro is a miracle of perfectionism married to expertise. The same can said for Gelb's loving documentary."
Franciosi grabs the film by its shoulders and turns it into a searing&#44; singular experience&#46;
A slick weepie made by smart guys who want you to know they're better than the schlockmeisters.
A totally absorbing movie.
A non-stop action fest.
Good but not great. Streep and Roberts feel a little too much like stunt-casting.
"Broader and more accessible than either Shaun Of The Dead or Hot Fuzz, Paul is pure Pegg and Frost - clever, cheeky and very, very funny."
Skyfall returns Bond to Solid Ground
"Pitt's ridiculous, wildly over-the-top performance somehow keeps it all together."
"Thanks to her infectious laugh and caustic sense of humour, as well as her honesty about what she's witnessed, we are treated to a welcome portrait of an artist who continues to radiate us with her talent."
"Despite the director's smarmy narration and interviews, the bemused equanimity of these folks who've seen it all could inspire each of us to what ""we can can"" do as we age."
Director Igal Hecht has pulled together a compelling film about an extraordinary man. There are moments of true heartbreak and tragedy mixed with wild road stories and the Iron Sheik's trademark over-the-top personality.
It's both gorgeous enough and emotionally engaging enough to be worth seeking out.
"There are lots of lovely touches, including animated sequences (the film is based on a graphic novel) and Powley is terrific - funny and wise beyond her years."
"Extraordinary...not only an engrossing first-hand account of Israel's Palestinian policies over time, but one that may have lessons to teach both Israeli leaders and other nations confronting those they identify as terrorists."
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a mind-blowing visual and mental extravaganza that leaves you in utter awe...
"It might not supplant ""It's a Wonderful Life"" in the pantheon of required December viewing, but I recommend giving it a spot in your holiday rotation."
"The perfect conversation starter, and a great way for people unable (or unwilling) to understand the trans struggle to see it from a fresh, new perspective."
"It's a surprisingly epic and spirited film, driven by an adventurous spirit and enough clever fun to keep things fresh during a sometimes long-winded ride."
"Anderson eloquently blends these characters together for a tantalizing seriocomic medley. He keeps his proceedings glossy and tantalizing, while steady and harshly real."
"""The animation was beautiful, the storyline set in place, telling a tale of how traditions and cultures can work presently to unite us all."""
"The film is one of those rare beasts, with a sense of genuine permanency. It beds down in your mind, like it is preparing to live there for a while. It is not pretty, but it is, sometimes, very beautiful."
One of 2022&apos;s 20 best films&#46;
"At 89, Morenos petite frame still radiates star charisma and vitality. Viewers will come away from this film feeling like Moreno didnt just live life; she earned it."
"Linney and Grace play off one another beautifully, her reticent better judgment collapsing in equal proportion to his ironic detachment."
"Love it or hate it, you won't be able to leave it alone."

Even Cecil B. DeMille might have been impressed.
"If you want a film that is big and true and tough, go see Synecdoche. And then go see it again, because it's so rich with ideas that you can't possibly get them all the first time around."
Amalric&#8217;s emotional mystery&#44; as its fragments and enigmas unfold&#44; isn&#8217;t necessarily a journey for viewers to solve but rather a state of mind to understand&#58; the bewitchingly poignant story of a woman&#8217;s fertile&#44; possibly perilous&#44; coping mechanism&#46;
"Stunning visuals and imagery, exceptional directing, and stellar performances by all the cast members make this the can't miss movie of the year."
"Entertaining and well acted, but redundant and a bit machinelike."
[A] satirical tableau of a Poland that does not recognize itself. [Full review in Spanish]
"Taking the long view that Winner's case is hardly an aberration, the director seems to inhabit the role of whistleblower as well, upending an ongoing narrative put forth by those outside the government that continues to see that true justice isn't served."
The Wayans are the masters of spoof.
intelligent and moving
"A loving paean to Bond, Flint, Helm and their ilk (as well as a myriad of outlandish villains), the film knows its turf and only missteps when it ventures into more contemporary territory."
"Whether it's ""Alex Rider,"" ""Agent Cody Banks"" or ""Spy Kids,"" plenty have tried to adapt the 007 shtick to younger characters, with demonstrably dopey results. In the end, the reason it works for Vaughn is that he's making the film for adults."
"The filmmakers have created an intensely stark and visceral representation of this hellish place, and the cinematography is intimate and stunning."
Decent 70s thriller.
"Girl Asleep might be about an awakening, but it's not a sexual awakening, and this is one teen comedy in which, at long last, the geek doesn't get the girl."
"Boasting a clever title, this is an inspired piece of lunacy about sociology versus biology, with terrific performances from Ben Stiller and his two sets of parents."
"Splice went down smooth, with its sleek surfaces, terrific special effects and disturbing sexiness."
"The Christian-themed drama God Bless the Broken Road wears its earnest heart on its sleeve, and isn't afraid to show it."
"What's special about the film is how much we come to know Frankie, perhaps more than he knows himself."
"After a muddled beginning, the deliberately paced film ties together its characters and disparate genre elements in mostly unexpected ways."
Engaging without relying on blockbuster bravado.
"Mostly, you'll just have to take my word for it that Spider-Man: Far From Home is a damned delight."
"Don't get me wrong, Spider-Man is no instant classic, but as summer blockbuster entertainment, you're not apt to find much better"
"THE PIANIST is Polanski's most personal work to date, and perhaps because of that, Polanski seems to have rediscovered the cinematic voice he had as a young man."
A pleasure. [Full review in Spanish]
"At least Ratner knows how to handle both action and drama on screen, even if subtlety and substance fall by the wayside."
Judging it by itself as a solo slasher film from 2018 it aced it... as a sequel it did even better.
Pfeiffer is outstanding.
"The directors jump into an impoverished, fast-moving life, and never attempt to put on the brakes for the sake of providing audience comfort."
Micmacs is eccentric ecstasy.   [Full review in Spanish]

"William Wayne, who wrote, directed, produced, edited, and stars in the film...clearly had a vision for the movie."
"Menashe may be a film of understated storytelling and plot, but its pleasures lie primarily in the wonderfully observational approach that Weinstein takes to his protagonist."
"Director Lee Chang-dong has complete mastery of the tone here and he gets great, subtle performances from his cast."
"Director Ryusuke Hamaguchi uses his ample running time to help us understand his complex, guarded characters so we cannot help but feel happy when they find some measure of happiness"
It's Swamp Thing. It's not Swamp Hamlet or MacBeth Thing.
"Cage delivers a superb performance in a role that seems specifically tailored to his abilities, helping Sarnoski find a brutal reality underneath what initially appears to be a silly concept for a revenge picture."
"[Fellin] turns the world into his circus and, in a liberated, quasi-documentary style, resurrects some of history's great pagliacci with their cornucopia of practical jokes, smashed hats, pulled chairs, popping balloons and squirting flowers."
Silly but irresistible.
"While The Long Night may not be revolutionary, it's definitely got its own dark magic."
"On the run in New York with every hitman in creation on his tail, JW needs the skills of a samurai, the reflexes of a striking snake, the speed and stealth of a wolf, a hide of pig iron and a perfectly tailored suit."
"It is a sitcom with teeth and haunting moral echoes, no small amount of vulgarity and a smart streak of comedy."
"It sounds like the latest release from Blumhouse Productions, but the documentary from filmmakers Shannon Service and Jeffrey Waldron is more frightening than any fabricated specter as the underbelly of Thailand's seafood trade is exposed."
"Imagine a Spike Jonze-Charlie Kauffman-Michel Gondry-style film but with a warm, beating heart instead of cool, detached hipster irony."
"The result is a decent picture, if one that leans pretty heavily on the future resonance of every interaction and conversation."
Springy and funny. A literary adaptation for people who don't like literary adaptations.
"Sorkin owes more to the slam-bang mayhem of Danny Boyle than the visual elegance of David Fincher, but mostly he gets out of the way of his writing - delivering for good and ill (but mostly good) a full-throttle Sorkin ride."
"In spots, the movie can be hysterical. But, for the most part, its appeal is not unlike that of a veteran rock band putting on a greatest hits concert."
"Anchored by Denzel Washington's steely presence, it's a spare, brutal vigilante exercise, with an element of righteous revenge mixed into the balance."
There's something quite wonderful about having a bear that is this free to speak its mind.
"In an age when the Shrek films make oral sex jokes and Cars 2 flip-flops between tedium and terror, the real pleasure of the gentle, graceful Winnie the Pooh is that it is a kid's film that really, truly works for kids."
The performances by Michael Douglas and Matt Damon are wonderful. The fug of jealousy and drug-fuelled paranoia is very well maintained.
A young African Christian travels to Israel in an insightful drama about the moral conflict between religious idealism and the crude materialism of the modern world.
"It's on for the relatively young and old in the sixth M.I. go-round, with Tom Cruise back on deck, Henry Cavill joining the ranks as an agenda-heavy CIA agent and Christopher McQuarrie taking the reins once more."
It's such a superlative movie that it seems better the second time you see it.
"Few films in recent history have moved me quite like Supernova, a sensitive drama starring Stanley Tucci as one half of a gay couple who is slowly but surely succumbing to dementia."
Orphan&#58; First Kill is every bit as satisfyingly twisted as its predecessor&#44; and certainly counts as the most gloriously demented horror surprise since Malignant&#46;
"""Christine"" is based on true events, and I suspect it's all the more powerful if you don't know what happens at the end. I did, but the film still gripped me."
"This latest adaptation of a rarely well-filmed novel makes a strong effort to capture the stiflingly provincial world that Flaubert was able to describe in such precise, painstaking detail on the page."
"Marlon Brando gives a bravura, dusty-voice performance in the title role as the Sicilian who harvests favours from all comers, only to ask them to be paid back."
"Fun, forgettable stuff -- but also a (slightly) better film than the reviews would have you believe."
"Mansfield 66/67 tries to pin down a mythic figure, caught in changing times, changing attitudes towards women, and the endless altercation between exploitation and empowerment."
Makes the Jumanji reboot superfluous.
If Merchant-Ivory made a horror film it would look something like this.
"It's not the tightest picture, but the primary elements are well cared for, providing a reasonable green-and-red rush of festive fun."

"Just when it seemed as if we had lost Tom Cruise to the ranks of paycheck-cashing automatons no longer interested in applying themselves on screen, along comes American Made to show there's still some life left in the maverick actor."
"Tonally inconsistent, at least it errs on the side of ambition and cleverness; its box-office failure suggests that male genre fans don't want to be asked to identify with the victims instead of the menace."
"Gray’s latest, Armageddon Time, is a flawed work. But it sees the filmmaker at his most vulnerable, as he twists the camera back on himself and asks: of all the paths that brought me here, how many were carved out by my own privilege? "
"""Red Rocket"" remains such a blisteringly raw and febrile character study because of how things fluctuate along the fixed orbit of its star."

"The film’s effectiveness depends on what occurs on the way to the answers, and in this respect Shyamalan’s wit and sincerity serve him and the audience well."

"[Idris] Elba isn't afraid to keep it real when it comes to visualising D's slow descent to darkness, transitioning from colourful Kingston to run-down, gritty London."

Reaps its full portion of machismo's horrors and hosannas.
"For anyone who appreciates artistic integrity and is interested in genuinely independent films, the prolific and highly personal work of John Sayles is essential viewing."

"Like the best movies often do, ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" leaves audiences with a complex set of emotions, and with a hard-to-define hint of the profound."
"""Captain America: Civil War"" is a much better version of ""Batman v Superman."" Not only does the film juggle a dozen major superheroes pretty seamlessly, but it manages to tell a cohesive story without making the film feel too stuffed."

"Probably one for those already enamoured with its creator, though there are numerous fascinating threads to untangle from this baroque tapestry if one has the patience."

"Yeah, 'Captain America: Civil War' is true to its frenetic form as revved up entertainment preparing moviegoers for the upcoming summertime sizzle at the box office. After all, the on-screen Marvel Comics gravy train keeps moving merrily along"
A first-class thriller and thought-provoking morality play.
"Apart from a contrived ending, Jindabyne comes as close as can be to a perfect drama."

...Black Panther is one of the best Marvel films ever.

"By the time the credits roll, Landis has given us the goods, but more importantly, he's given us a good story."

"There are a few incredibly great laughs, and believe it or not, it's the most ""fun"" of the slasher horror films there's been in the 10 movies."

"Such a personal take is necessarily also partial. There's no Pete Doherty here, nothing from her last boyfriend, no one from the music industry... There are touching glimpses into the afterlife of a shortlived talent"
Brett Morgen makes some odd choices&#46; But on the whole&#44; this is an immersion into the quintessence of Bowie&#46;  An intoxicating portrait of the artist as a constantly morphing young man&#44; middle-aged man and man facing death before his time&#46;

A flawed but funny and heartfelt film that suggests: maybe you can go home again-even if that means coming back to Jersey.

"This is no doubt the first of many movies that will struggle to tell the stories of a war that's far from over, and even if the tale is imperfectly told, it commands our attention."

"It's a beautiful, melancholy film, and makes you begin to wonder if Karl Marx didn't have a point."
"This enigmatic, poetic film, co-directed by brothers Ramon and Silvan Zürcher, instils intimations of the cosmic into a deliberately ordinary narrative frame."

"Inspiring, if Harrowing, For Sama Is for All of Us."
"For fans who ask for nothing more than something upbeat and friendly, it should satisfy, even if it isn't long remembered."

The movie is clearly intriguing in ways it may not have intended.

The Help has so much heart it's easy to feel both sorrow and enjoyment while watching such an emotional film.
Julie & Julia is a delectable cinematic concoction about two food-loving women.

"As Felice reacquaints himself with old haunts, Mario Martone’s film captures their atmosphere and the feelings they inspire in the long-absent native."
The new film hints mischievously at the kind of dysfunction that would truly bring the Brady bunch up to date.
Wild Rose is as wily as its titular character. This tale of a Glasgow born country (not country-western) singer and ex-convict can't help but have a bit of an unexpected edge.
"Like a Disney family drama from TV times past, this feelgood road movie is so homely, so warm and fuzzy, and so darn wholesome that it's almost too much."
"a trailblazing firecracker...and monotony be damned, I hope it becomes a franchise"
"Though [it] suggests a classic-Hollywood throwback, this story thankfully feels fresh and original."
"Audiard crafts a film with logical scenic construction yet surprising turns of events, with the drama never devolving into melodrama."
"Great fun, with a terrific euro-grunge soundtrack."
Seagal goes back to a formula that works.
"One of Lynch's darkest, most disturbing films precisely because it is able to delve into the places that the show simply wasn't allowed to explore on national television."
Meditative cinema.
"If you're ever considered whether a port-a-potty would make a good catapult, this is for you."
...more interesting in what's going on in the heads of the protagonists rather than on the court between them...
This gripping (or nauseating) film has power beyond its ideas.
A very frank and gritty story about two brothers.
"""The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby: Them"" is worth seeing, if only for the way the camera lingers on Jessica Chastain as if she's a silken magnet."
"Storks is at times cacophonous and overly busy, and the animation tends toward the goofy rather than the spectacular. However, Stoller manages to pull off a third act and emotional resolution that's genuinely moving."
The filmmakers celebrate his prodigious achievements but the sadness is that he never managed to escape the hothouse world of the fashion industry.
"But the power of Titanic didn't come from originality; it came from punching cliches across with a seldom-seen directness and sincerity that seemed pure of heart, ""old-fashioned,"" or plain corny, depending on your perspective."
With an A-list cast happily playing against type&#44; a nonlinear storytelling approach&#44; witty dialogue and a plethora of creative violence&#44; Bullet Train plays out like an immensely satisfying upgrade of prime Tarantino&#46;
"Poignant, feminist coming-of-age drama set in 1960 Oklahoma."
"...as if they took the adage that the 'sequel is never quite as good' as permission, rather than a challenge."
"Has some restraint when it comes to the inevitable sadness, and more importantly, actual respect in telling the story of these real people"
Occupation: Rainfall at least proves that the passion is there from an Australian cast and crew to deliver a no-brainer action film as big as Hollywood could do.
Be prepared to acid-trip down a rabbit hole with Nicolas Cage in the horror spectacle Color Out of Space.
"One of the nicest things to say about Trolls World Tour is that it moves pretty briskly. It's not particularly impactful, but it should be entertaining enough for young viewers."
Three generations of women struggle to survive in an inhospitable wilderness in Brazil far from civilization.
"A dizzyingly attractive film that breaks down Noam Chomsky's ideas, filters them through Michel Gondry's unique way of seeing, and in the process breaks down the differences between art, science and philosophy"
In the end this thriller functions to makes us feel uncomfortable. [Full review in Spanish]
A genial and glossy middle-brow rom/com blended together with corny Capra-like political drama.
Dench makes mincemeat of the often pedantic material.
"2025 has been a big year for musicals. In performance, script and look, Cyrano is the best of the bunch."
"Akin makes this a most intriguing, if roundabout, journey from despair to 'do something.'"
"Effective as it all is - even with an over-reliance on jump scares - ""The Purge: Election Year"" is, like the rest of the films in a series, an ugly one, reliant on scenes of sadism and depravity."
"At the film's core is the question, what if some love is based not on love but in a dichotomy of horrific power and desire?"
Repulsive but mesmerizing.
We see the seeds of something special here; Palmer cements herself here as one to watch in the years to come.
"It manages to infuse its simple narrative with a spicily subversive attitude toward traditional gender roles, while spooning its audience generous helpings of sweetly seductive costume romance."
"""Catching Fire"" is more substantial than the first feature because it delves deeper into themes such as loyalty, love, honor, sacrifice and freedom"
"Michael Bay knows how to make an action movie that’s worth your time, and that’s exactly what Ambulance is."
Those not interested in continuity or source material won&#8217;t have any problems with &#8220;Thor&#58; Ragnarok&#8221;&#46;
"Chan puts his heart and soul into the part of Big Soldier, and it's a reminder that there is more to the actor than Hollywood cinemagoers may have witnessed."
Elephant invites scrutiny but defies explanation.
Sidney Lumet returns to the sort of form he showed in his heyday. It helps that we're on Lumet's favourite territory -- the heist gone wrong.
"All that's missing is the spirit and the anarchic humor of the sitcom created by Mel Brooks and Buck Henry. The result is an overdressed, carefully stitched scarecrow of a comedy."
The first part of The Phantom could almost be a summation to the jury by the prosecution.
Paul Green is like the crazy uncle that your kids love to be around even if he makes them cry.
"For the most part this is an entertaining, and old-fashioned feeling film."
Breaking the rules has never seemed so fun . . . or so necessary.
Seance is an enjoyable mystery horror that works against itself in its frenetic final moments. The early parts of the movie are patient and build a mystery.
"Along with The Postman segment from Satyajit Ray's Two Daughters, it is, I think, the greatest short film ever made."
"Lohman adapts to the changes required of her, but the actress and director Peter Kosminsky never get the audience to break through the wall her character erects"
"Precious captures how a lost girl rouses herself from the dead, and Daniels shows unflinching courage as a filmmaker by going this deep into the pathologies that may still linger in the closets of some impoverished inner-city lives."
"Sayles' prolix narrative, weighed down with subplots and characters and canvassing many social ills, dilutes the impact of a work that should nevertheless still make an impact on thoughtful viewers."
His latest offering is as vibrant as any he has produced.
Reno himself can take credit for most of the movie's success. He's one of the few 'cool' actors who never seems aware of his own coolness.
"There may be much that is familiar, but with this version Wright nevertheless manages to be both reverent and innovative, with more than a dash of ... panache."
"A well-crafted tearjerker with a grown-up performance from Zac Efron. If you don't mind risking dehydration, it's the movie for you."
The deliriously demented 1960s Japanese show 'Johnny Sokko and His Flying Robot' proves to be a stronger influence on 'Pacific Rim' than any Godzilla movie.
... A suspense masterpiece ...
"""Happy being weird, at least giving the film some character when the storyline is too poorly executed to pick up the slack."""
"Weitz's rousing satire is no dream: It's the mad, mad real world of America in the year 2006."
"On the surface a literate werewolf thriller, the subtext of Mike Nichols' Wolf is a sharp critique about what it takes to succeed in the cutthroat corporate world."
"Efficient and highly effective in its style, relying on sound, creepy production design, and the men's own fear and misjudgment to create the sense of pervasive doom."
"Yesterday fulfills its modest ambitions with warmth and gentle humor. It wouldn't, however, make any impact if it were magically erased from existence."
"This beautiful 2K restoration...features the original intertitles while simulating the color tinting and toning of the original not seen since the 1920's...Unveiled at the 2016 Berlin Film Festival, Kino Lorber's release is a real treat for cinephiles."
The wonders never stop.
"As Michele, Huppert contains literal volumes."
"Rewarding, but ridiculously stingy in handing out simple details -- relationships, geographical settings, etc. -- vital to our grasp of what's going on."
"It's hard not to love these confident, capable, problem-free post-millennials."
An intriguing if rather run-of-the-mill feature debut for writer-director Yannick Saillet.
"A well made, atmospheric British thriller with terrific performances from a superb cast, though it's a little undermined by some casting issues and the script falters towards the end."
I will probably get a few digs from my friends for insisting that Ford v. Ferrari is not only entertaining but also smart.
"For those seeking a wickedly dark little confection, Thoroughbreds should prove a diverting watch; but those looking for anything deeper will find a lot left to be desired."
"Pushes the idea of the capricious monarch through the far reaches of comedy and almost into tragedy. Colman embodies sublimely the punch-drunk confusion of a woman unsure whether she's child or adult, plaything or puppet-master."
"The sort of romance that doesn't come around too often&#151;intelligent without being saccharine, heartfelt without being condescending."
If you've seen 'You Can Count on Me' you have a pretty good idea where 'The Skeleton Twins' is headed in its somewhat didactic approach to celebrating the unbreakable bonds siblings share. Yet you admire it just the same.
"This rip-roaring slice of sci-fi excess remains Arnold Schwarzenegger's most satisfying film since his breakthrough hit, The Terminator."
"Landon is focused on delivering a wild ride that holds together surprisingly well, despite the increased narrative complication."
"Heloise and Marianne, and the way their ardor is allowed to slowly unfold onscreen is both heartwarming and, given the dismal prospects for a future together, heartbreaking."
"This is a sadistic film, so be warned."
It&#8217;s an appealing film&#44; but not one that goes beyond what most viewers will be expecting&#46;
Bong Joon-ho does an exemplary job balancing a mystery with both humorous and dramatic elements.
Has a few scares up its sleeve ...
"If you're able to give yourself over to it, there's a quiet brutality to this tale of dogmatic obsession, shot and performed with simmering intensity as it is."
"Anxiety inducing imagery aside, I already want to watch this flick again."
"Set in the ruthlessly competitive ballet world, Black Swan is a trashy melodrama with a glossy artsy treatment, but it's gripping due to its speed and Natalie Portman's Oscar-caliber performance."
"As remakes go, Disney's latest might just be their best one yet, soaring to such stratospheric heights I almost can't help but be amazed."
"It's quaint, a little rustic but magical in its own way."
Ant-Man is great; an optimistic jaunt with plenty of cleverness and oodles of joy. Yet another feather in Marvel Studio's increasingly peacocked cap.
As we all know&#44; leaky containers can result in zombies&#44; as in The Return of the Living Dead&#44; homicidal maniacs&#44; as in The Crazies&#44; or a mind leech&#44; as in Mind Leech&#46;
"It's not quite a Hamilton movie, but it'll still blow you all away."
"As much of a pleasure as it is to watch Washington, Davis and Henderson interact, the film loses steam as it enters the final third."
"in Mr. Saturday Night, Billy Crystal nimbly makes the big leap from amiable (if sometimes irritating) funny man to serious, but not-too-serious filmmaker."
Its blend of speed and music makes 'Baby Driver' one of the year's best films.
"Talladega Nights is as good as a summer comedy about NASCAR has any right to be, with fine actors tucked into every nook and cranny."
"It has a light, shaggy charm, and De Niro is at his most winningly comical."
The Pianist is Polanski's best film.
"...the movie remains watchable even through the sporadic lulls within the narrative, something that's due almost entirely to Gervais' almost ridiculously entertaining performance."
"Maybe, the story spends too much time preaching, but Mascaro holds tight to his credo, aiming at the Brazilian conservatism with irony."
VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN is an enjoyable - if more than a bit silly - take on the classic story.
"[A] rich, fun and fascinating film experience."
"Senna feels a touch too short to be fully realized -- but then again, so was Ayrton Senna's life."
"It ... is worth watching for its crackerjack opening and the strength of its young cast, but mainly because of its inherent promise of (possibly) better things to come."
"I loved this, it's hilarious, heart warming and a little stroke of genius.."
"Shanghai Noon feels both like a flashback to an earlier time of more innocent pictures, and also slightly predictive of the vanguard of colourful comic-book cinema to come."
"Tully is worth a look for its true-to-life characters, its sensitive acting, its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer Hilary Birmingham."
traces the end of an era in muted colors and a somber mood sparked by dry humor&#8230; quiet gem of a film
"A Miracle of Miracles examines both the development of the much loved ""dark musical"" and its enduring popularity for audiences all around the world."
Syrup does nothing to challenge the stereotype but instead embraces it in an outlandish farce.
[Brown] collects some fascinating stories.
Zootopia excels on so many levels that it stands with the finest of the Disney classics.
"The ending is rather predictable, but the rest of the film is very skillfully wrought, with excellent performances by adults and children alike."
Sentiment is explained by science as the family impulse that motivates so many Steven Spielberg stories is revealed to be an evolutionary imperative in this near-perfect action-adventure.
"Ducournau eschews jump scares and instead focuses on tone, never allowing the audience to fully relax by peppering even what appear to be quotidian transition scenes with little reminders of the macabre."
Both archival footage of her remarkable flamenco and current interviews in which she speaks about rhythm entering the body reveal a natural artist who was born to dance.
"This last half of Lloyd's latest may not have a soothing effect upon people afflicted with nervous disorders... there are genuine shocks in Safety Last, some that can only be described by seeing them."
...a somber and contemplative study of a disenfranchised British man's journey of self-discovery via the bodily functions of a female dog over a period of 14-years.
This might be the best film of 2008.
Great seeing this portrait of a conductor who has just done some amazing things with the kids and adult musicians hes worked with. 
"[Beirut] is definitely a step up, with a stronger cast, led by Jon Hamm and Rosamund Pike, and a more polished screenplay."
"It shouldn't come as a surprise that Cody wrote the script after having her own third child, or that this excellent ode to self-care ranks among her finest, most mature pieces of work."
has stood the test of time to remain as funny today as anything Hollywood is producing now.
"Villeneuve's Dune takes a bit of time to set up the necessary palace intrigue and family dynamics before finding its shape as a relentless, propulsive chase movie."
"With Flushed Away, Aardman [Animations] has moved away from a guy and his dog to a girl and her mouse, but they're almost just as fun."
"[VIDEO] You can't relive the heady days and nights of Manhattan's club scene, but you can soak up some of the flavor. You'll also get a crash course in the city's muscle of political corruption that seems to increase with every passing year."
"This film barely brushes up against the many, many issues it raises, but those conversations can be had in the lobby, after the pleasure of watching an underappreciated artist finally get her due."
"Proving why he's still an American classic, 83-year-old director Sidney Lumet turns in another brilliantly executed crime thriller"
"Yes, it's a crowd pleaser and you can count me in as very much part of the crowd."
"Equity has injected women protagonists into a genre traditionally dominated by men, charging the Wall Street thriller with a buzz of female energy."
"Feels like no other film that you've seen before. It's cerebral and lugubrious, yet simple as a fairy tale."
One of the best originals that the platform has produced. [Full review in Spanish]
"While everyone remembers this film about an autistic man as Dustin Hoffman's Oscar-winning triumph, it is equally Tom Cruise's."
"It's not entirely clear how much of Big Game is funny on purpose, but it hardly matters when the action is so slick and the dialogue so ripe."
"(Director David) Fincher and (screenwriter Steven) Zaillian have visualized a cold, dreary and ugly Sweden that draws you in against your better instincts"
"Unpredictable, richly crafted, and beautifully written, The Drop is like the best liquor from the top shelf: it goes down hard and harsh, but it hangs on and gets its hooks right into you."
Gray keeps his picture interesting with a handful of inspired action scenes
The Oscar-nominated Rear Window isn&apos;t just one of Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s best films but one of the greatest thrillers ever made&#46;
"Chris Peckover's Christmas horror comedy is a deft melding of ""Scream"" and ""Home Alone"" that takes a surprisingly nasty turn in its last act...he really excels in his direction of his young cast"
"Mathieu Kassovitz is making a determined challenge for the stylish French sci-fi thriller crown of Luc Besson with this highly effective, highly charged action movie, even though he has had to rather mangle the novel on which it is based"
"[I]ts daffy, otherworldly story, rehearsing but not rehashing Stillman's frankly reactionary instincts, resounds less for its charming gaggle of collegiate women than for its dramatization of self-deception and the despair of depression."
A riveting and quirky movie about the aftershocks of 9/11 in the lives of a group of people still in denial a year later.
This contradiction - an activist for social justice with a blue-blooded partner - is sadly never explored.
"A timeless story about how the whole world is a potential threat to women, and even the smallest interactions can be loaded with unbearable consequences."
"Such an accurate, humble and kind autopsy. [Full Review in Spanish]"
It's an achingly poignant meditation on passion and loneliness in oxygen-choked Kuala Lumpur.
"Great documentaries, of which this is one, need great subjects, and Mr. Honnold fills the bill; he's thoughtful, funny, articulate, self-reflective and fatalistic to a scary degree."
"Adheres to the dumb/smart approach of other classics such as Airplane! and The Naked Gun. Opens strong, gets a lot of funny jokes in and then loses steam heading into the finale, but a worthy early horror parody nonetheless"
"Will appeal mostly to those who love theater and relish the opportunity to see a production being built, scene by scene."
"The craftsmanship of ""A War"" is unimpeachable. Tight shots and jittery camera work give the film an immediate, intimate feel."
"Ayers's warmest film to date finds meaning and depth in its ""I love you, man"" exchanges and rarely goes too long without staging some daring detective work and videogame ultraviolence."
"More than a narrative, the film is a study in visual ways to convey the ""swimmy,"" unreal sensations of love at first sight."
"Detroit is a gut-punch of a movie, one that pulls you in to the ugliness lying beneath the American id."
A slick and stylish horror comedy which delivers on both fronts.
"The Iperess File is a thriller set in a recognisable London where espionage is a seedy business conducted, not by impregnable Bonds, but by men as scared and venal as anyone else."
"Writer-director Sofia Coppola has produced a small-scale movie that exalts old-fashioned movie-making qualities, yielding a refreshingly understated alternative to a sea of summer blockbusters."
"Kulig dazzles as the poised, fearless, unpredictable Zula. Like a little dynamite she's ready to light up any scene with the sheer force of her joy, rage or pain."
This is an inspirational film about perseverance.
"Solidly telling in its methodical truth, Green's film is unassumingly dazzling in its low-key observations. The Assistant is impressively potent without the overstated exclamation of acrimony."
Director Sollett adds a humanistic layer of insight and wisdom to the story that transcends teen-pic formulas.
One of the best films of the year-it salutes openness and respect for life as antidotes to the use of violence to deal with the uncertainty and insecurity of our times.
The final 20 minutes of the film prove once again that what you can't see is infinitely more frightening than what you can..leaves you goosey and tense.
Funny when it needs to be. I don't know what more you can ask from the third installment of a series that has gone further than anyone reasonably could have expected.
"Politics aside, Herzog uses a realistic tone to depict a high-energy capture and escape."
"Like most of Grisham's stories, the set-up is better than the wrap-up, but this is a cast that knows how to satisfy, even when the material doesn't."
...a perfectly watchable (yet undeniably overlong) entry in an almost remarkably consistent series...
"As the characters get more intimate, so too does the film, with McCormack and, especially, Thompson cutting through the film’s more mechanical execution to deliver rounded portraits of people yearning for human connection in a judgmental world."
"The film is effective even when didactic, and Munn is terrific."
"For Daniel Craig the world of Bond could not be more far away: if his East European accent wobbles at times to Liev Schreiber's more authentic vocal, he looks the part of a man who can both kill and care."
"Adam Brody keeps the unnamed protagonist distant, strangely blank, as if part of his problem is his lack of any real personality of his own, prompting him to parasitise the charismatic women he meets and try to substitute scandalous behaviour for depth."
May be the finest thriller/romance hybrid of the new century.
"Its vision is unique and harrowing, its song hits to the heart."
"...two terrific bad guys. Banderas and Zeta-Jones are sexy and funny. Even with too many ridiculous fights, this is a lot of fun."
"It's a story designed to play the heartstrings like a fiddle, extracting sighs and sobs from willing viewers with surgical precision."
"The only slipup is a forgivable one. Jackson continues to be reluctant to leave a world he has so magnificently created. At a little over three hours, King Kong is a bit of a bum-number."
"There are plenty of great things about American Honey, but when stretched out to an incomprehensibly epic length, it is hard to see it as anything other than wasted potential."
"The film has grace, rhythm and music for a while with the story of the young man who only yearns to escape the crime world to rebuild his life. [Full review in Spanish]"
"It's no Jaws, but The Shallows is still a viciously, violently fun wave to ride."
"Delivers a hell of a lot of thrills as an R-rated romp that's refreshingly standalone, not trying to set up any sequels."
"Boyle -- and maybe Sorkin, though the domineering Sorkinese makes it hard to surmise -- is doing something smarter, even outright subversive."
"There are times in Christopher Nolan's somnolent crime caper where you'll find yourself recognizing moments from your own subconscious on the screen, to a thrilling, frightening and ultimately inspiring effect."
Taylor-Joy and Cooke are top-notch.
"The movie evaporates in the mind, but Stewart and Eisenberg have real movie-star chemistry."
A terrific picture crouched in the centre of a blasted Icelandic winter.
That moment where we see Captain Marvel in her full glory punching holes through the sky letting the audience know every girl can fly&#63; That moment Captain Marvel absolutely delivers&#46;
"The contrast in the acting styles of Pacino, De Niro and Pesci are predictable, yet gripping in this mob drama. Director Martin Scorsese is in his element directing this finely tuned 3 and a half hour lavish production."
"With some cool superhero action, Megamind is mildly amusing for the most part, but it feels like it could have been much better."
"Here, with everything that he's ever cared about on the line, Hunt proves why he's summer's most valuable action hero."
"""Scream 4"" lacks the qualities that would make it a masterpiece, but it testifies to the cyclical nature of commercial storytelling in sharp, nearly timeless fashion."
"The premise is ridiculously simple - take out your phone and film family members as they chat - but when your family is as expressive and poetic as Panahi's, most of your job is done for you."
Peter Dinklage is excellent as the mob's chief lawyer.
"Surprisingly candid, comprehensive and, most of all, emotional expos of the wrestling business."
"Follows [Pekar's] journey with originality, humor and humanity"
"If a movie can be defined by the strength of its villain, Avengers Infinity War is a giant. Towering over the spectacle is Josh Brolin's evil despot Thanos, whose striking capture motion performance and physicality comes close to stealing the film."
Iron Man is an action sci-fi blockbuster extravaganza that provides cartoon thrills for thinking people. It's the best movie of its kind since the second Spider-Man movie four years ago.
"The director's affectionate warts-and-all portrait of his milieu and subculture is blistering, cogently capturing how England's early-'80s skinhead movement was driven less by blind racial intolerance than by intense socio-economic tensions."
"The movie is self-pity disguised as self-sacrifice (he'll do anything for his fans) but it's also, by any measure, often funny."
This is terrific film-making - enough to bring a rush of blood to the head.
"Whether you know it or not, kids, you've now got your own generation's Close Encounters of The Third Kind."
Athlete A raises a lot of questions about the USAG's practices.
"The Unborn is a culty midnight movie that, like far more such films than we tend to credit, has a brain whose synapses are constantly firing away just beneath all the gore."
"Cove is a stirring call to arms, providing the damning dolphin massacre argument forcefully and creatively. I can't say the film will change the world, but it certainly will make those trips to Sea World more awkward."
"Maguire's otherworldly coolness suits the observer drawn into a story he might prefer only to watch. DiCaprio is persuasive as the little boy lost impersonating a tough guy, and Mulligan finds ways to express Daisy's magnetism and weakness."
"""The Day after Tomorrow is junk, but it's not a rip-off. Emmerich sincerely wants to entertain you, which is more than you can say for most of his Hollywood peers."""
"Kumail Nanjani and Issa Rae's chemistry and ease of dialogue make The Lovebirds feel like a throwback to corny, yet entertains Golden-Age rom coms. Unicorn suits, milkshake monologues and ride share jokes are worth the ride."
"An accomplished, insightful, touching film."
&quot;The Lighthouse&quot; has echoes of Melville and Lovecraft as well as Coleridge and Greek mythology&#44; all stirred together in a psychedelic stew&#44; or a cup of turpentine and honey&#46; The honey is the film&apos;s sumptuous aesthetic&#46;
"It willingly follows its characters into the muck of brotherly love, misery, impulse and idiocy."
"A lot of The Descendants is affecting, but its mushier tone is often less emotionally resonant than the bitter sarcasm of Payne's earlier work."
"It has dryly obscene, laugh-out-loud lines, and its portrait of Hollywood as a giant anxiety attack is fused by De Niro, who musters a desperate, nagging warmth beneath his grumbly facade."
"A Monster Calls may seem like a simple fantasy film, but it goes beyond that to tackle a very real tragedy - losing someone. Word of advice: bring a lot of tissues to this one."
You won't be able to dismiss this movie as easily as Etienne ignores Lolita.
a masterpiece of action adventure science fiction fueled by a terrific international cast...Joon-ho has more on his mind than startling imagery and violence and his climax is both breathtaking and an emotional gut punch.
I Served the King of England ends up a curious combination of raunchy merriment and malignant undercurrents.
... a dramedy thatll have you laughing through tears.
A tight-fisted and paranoid mini-classic.
"Bielinsky's script is slick and fiendishly clever, with seemingly a twist a minute."
"Forget motion-capture, this is motion-rapture. Meanwhile, Oscar-winning composer Michael Giacchino (Up) finds some extraordinary piano notes to emphasise contemplative silence as much as imminent threat."
This is an almost apocalyptic tale of thwarted emotion - love cut short - set in a pitiless land of delusions.
"It's too much of a stretch to say Venom is ""good,"" but it's certainly not terrible, and maybe worth seeing for Hardy alone."
"One of the broadest, silliest (yet somehow still endearing) stoner comedies in a while, indulging the adult members of the cast with particular gusto."
"It's just, like ... well, a lot like real life for 20-somethings."
"Through her constant swings between the public and the private, Whitney tears the icon and reveals a soul. [Full Review in Spanish]"
It's Levy and his chemistry with Jackson that keeps The Man from being ho-hum.
Wright remarkably shows you how instead of iron fists as tools&#44; we see Edgerton&#8217;s Mark uses something entirely different &#8212; empathy&#46;
"Nichols ... tells the Lovings' story in a way that feels immediate and modern, and not just like a history lesson."
"The movie is poppy, clever and more than enjoyable, but Posey is something else altogether. She's a revelation."
"This is an, at times, terrifying film that, refreshingly, does not rely on cheap jump scares."
Nymphomaniac isn't as much about female power as the dialogue occasionally suggests; it's more about being misunderstood because of the things you choose (or are compelled) to pursue.
"This good natured film feels like an episode of Nashville mixed with an episode of Friday Night Lights, two television shows I happen to enjoy, in spite of their soapiness."
Luck doesn&#8217;t break a lot of new ground&#46; But the movie has some creative elements and likable characters&#46; The animation is solid&#44; though not eye popping&#46; The voice cast is good&#46; &#46;&#46;&#46; It&#8217;s a rare movie these days that has both a G-rating and a plot&#46;
"Olivier Martinez makes the kind of visceral impression Brad Pitt made in Thelma and Louise, but it's Gere's layered performance that makes Unfaithful a sophisticated, interesting adult drama."
"Marketed as a guitar summit between The Edge, Jimmy Page, and Jack White, Davis Guggenheim's affectionate, intermittently insightful behind-the-music doc is more electric triptych than meeting of the minds."
"Its nastiness sings, instead of stings."
"The protagonists are likable, have charismatic chemistry, and are portrayed brilliantly. You will love to hate the well crafted antagonist who creates obstacles for our leads."
"For a film that's just shy of being three hours long, it never felt bloated; every sequence seemed to have its place, and at the right pace..."
"Harari chooses to create a psychological portrait of his central character, using images rather than explanations of ideology to tap into Onoda’s mind-set."
"While King Arthur is not Guy Ritchie gold, it is an entertaining film that serves up the right amount of thrills, spills and wit."
"This powerful, heartfelt and important drama from one of the great names in world cinema deserves to be seen."
You know how much of a guy flick this is? There's no women in it.
A profoundly sexist and eminently hummable 1954 CinemaScope musical with some terrific athletic Michael Kidd choreography and some better-than-average direction by Stanley Donen.
A Hidden Life is a commanding piece of cinema that lingers long after you've left the theatre.
Something that the whole family can love.
A great big hug of a film.
"Gook may not come close to the electric greatness of Lee's 1989 film but, as a gesture in its direction, it's alive with biting promise."
Arkadina is one of literature's most narcissistic mothers - which is saying something - and yet Bening makes her damnably human.
"Friendsgiving is not destined to be a holiday classic, but it shows that with a good script and a talented cast, even an old formula can result in a surprisingly entertaining movie."
"Rosi celebrates the harsh beauty of the island in many long shots, as well as the humanity and patience of the islanders."
"A good action yarn, burdened from time to time by excessive dialogue, about the professional rodeo circuit and the hardy horse-tamers who inhabit it."

"An insightful and very sorry tale of the worst kind of greed, this Oscar-winning documentary exposes the people behind the global financial crisis, men & woman who are still wealthy and still running the banking industry."

"Even though I've heard quite of bit of his show before, I still enjoyed it."
The Fabelmans may be a light&#44; average film that&apos;s not particularly memorable&#44; but thanks to an exceptional ensemble and an intriguing story of how a cinematic genius got his start&#44; it becomes well-worth the somewhat lengthy two and a half hour investment&#46;

Oliver Stone gets his groove back
... a playful romantic comedy about six characters in search of love ...
"A charming and humorous re-release, but this entire experiment feels more like an alternate viewing mode on the Blu-ray release than a fully-fledged theatrical release."
"Whether or not certain events played out precisely as we're told, the urgency of Polsky's cautionary message is inarguable."
A rapturously seductive slow burn watch.
The kind of film we don't get too often anymore...

"Oscillating between mild humor and navel-gazing pretension, Brad's Status is a road movie about fathers and sons that sporadically lands when it stops taking everything so seriously."
"Fantastic fun, though with so many superheroes jostling for position it's hard to delve deep even in 2.5 hours. There are plenty of jokes, some hilarious, some endearingly clunky. Brolin imbues Thanos with remarkable depth."

"The sci-fi stuff is tedious, but Wiig and Mumolo are bawdy and brilliant as ever, their effortless chemistry bolstered by years of collaboration."
"Ahed's Knee therefore feels, at times, like a glorified diatribe against the establishment. But thankfully, Lapid embellishes the storytelling with cinematic flourishes that provide nuance and complexity."
An overlong but fascinating look at the life of a forgotten innovator of early rock'n roll
This is the work of a filmmaker blessed with the gift of chronicling the unbearable heaviness of being. He basks in the redemptive glow of thematic ambition.

"162 minutes represents a heavy investment in time and popcorn. But the unrelenting pace, almighty effects and sheer tongue-in-cheekiness make it more than worth your while."
Josh Brolin is terrific as Mannix. I chortled and laughed through the whole thing. And I smiled for hours afterward thinking about it.

"Kick-Ass 2 actually develops its main characters, Hit Girl and Kick Ass, allowing them to grow up in ways that are surprisingly fun and interesting."
"The timing for a movie like Stillwater could not be better, and hopefully there is a place for it in the ever-changing theatrical landscape."
"If the same story points were carried out with a heavier hand, this film would be booed off the screen as an absurdity; in the hands of the Duplasses, its quiet, quirky charms transform it into a disarming modern-day fable."
Not close to the insanely imaginative material from the show's heyday but still funny its own right
Samson and Delilah is impossible to ignore.
"The characters are drawn in broad strokes... Yet with Ryoo giving the action a Spielbergian sweep as the action builds towards the climactic prison break, you'll find yourselves rooting for them all the same."
Anthony Minghella's Breaking and Entering shimmers with good intentions and competency: Its blue/gray palette is elegant and unobtrusive; its cast is uniformly fine with occasional startling moments of brilliance.
Snyder's style is all about the iconography of rippling muscles and fights to the death; it's the down-to-earth elements of the Superman mythos that get short shrift here.
Wrath of the Titans is a testosterone fueled effects romp and proud of it.

Masterly by any measure.

A chaotically silly piece of insanity that had me laughing myself stupid for 70 minutes straight.
Timely and intriguing docu was the winner of the Directing and Audience Awards at the Sundance Film Fest.
"Funny man John Leguizamo gets in touch with his furious and fiery side in The Take, and that transitional extreme mood swing is surprisingly impressive."
It's a feel-good movie that happens to dress in drag.
"This world and the otherworldly embrace in riotous fashion as the wedding party grows more degenerate and destructive through the night. [D]ark seethes into the greater dark. The ordinary will get you, because the extraordinary is directly beneath it."
"...A good seafaring yarn, not romanticized like the cartoons or summer action pictures, but simply told with honesty and verisimilitude, the way it really must have happened."
"Just when so many ticket buyers ""of a certain age"" seem to have given up hope, here comes a delightful ""movie-movie"" that's most special of effects come from its flesh and blood, very human stars."

"Doomsaying about independent films... is this year's favorite kvetch, and yet movie hand grenades still manage to get tossed into our laps with astonishing regularity. Lynne Stopkewich's Kissed is a startling example."
A slick and suspenseful landing until it fails to stick the landing.
There's lots of interesting stuff to chew on...it's never less than compelling.
"With a simple but effective script and some fun visual experiments, KIMI is an entertaining conspiracy thriller set in (and very much about) the post-pandemic world."

"Judi Dench is not only a very talented actress, but also a very brave and versatile one."
"Most movies that try to crowd so much into an hour and a half end up looking like a shopping list, but Dreamscape works, maybe because it has a sense of humor."
"It's definitely of interest to the more-sensitive genre fan, one looking to feel something in the midst of their gore and goofs, and it's also for anyone who wants to celebrate the return of Maika Monroe to alt-superstardom."
"Endless is far from a masterpiece, but it largely works for what it is and is elevated as a whole by a wonderful central performance by Alexandra Shipp."
"Hustlers, it must be said, is hustle incarnate."
Conventionally made but extremely well-acted. It does what most stage-to-screen adaptations do not. It works.
It's films like Selma that remind us that behind every massive pivotal moment there are a thousands of smaller stories that come together like raindrops forming a ground-shaking thunderstorm.

"Araki has crafted an entertaining, violently funny movie that's amongst his best work yet."
"It's not pretty, and the humor is sometimes embarrassingly puerile, but for those with a passion for subversive trash, Troma Entertainment is still serving it on a bile-covered platter."

Each bottom feeding joke manages to be more side-splitting than the last.

"As a horror film, Hereditary delivers the goods, with crack pacing and a third act of sheer gothic madness."
Has its powerful moments.

Only the Brave might be the best movie ever made about firefighters.

Easily classifiable as one of the top ten films of all time.
Emasculation paranoia is alive and well.
"Refn is definitely a provocateur, but those audiences who enjoy being provoked should probably decide if they love it or hate it for themselves. We'll both be right."
"As good as the first two films were, as well as they redefined the action espionage thriller, the third film falls victim to its own innovation."
"[It's] a gleefully silly affair in the tradition of Dumb and Dumber. It's also a comedy where the old adage ""your mileage may vary"" holds a lot of weight."
"Everything that happens in the film feels ripped from reality and, as a result, it hits hard in a way that few films are able to manage."

"It does have one thing on its side: It's freakin' hilarious, man."
Everything works about this film except for a dubious ending that makes the couple look less sympathetic. A crowd-pleaser.

"Not many character-oriented thrillers like this get made, however, so it's nice to be able embrace the ones that do, if you can handle the eccentricities."
"It's just a little too jarring to be top notch, but it sure is powerful."
Um grande exercício de lógica e técnica narrativa.
"Perry sustains an infusion of tangy wit, as he mines the cultural and economic but primarily racial disconnects and divides of this nation. With a charmingly sweet and sour, more buoyant than boisterous Perry this time around, playfully at the helm."
Each of the actors smoulders with quiet strength.
It&#8217;s a truly great blockbuster&#44; one that surpasses the earlier theater release in every conceivable way&#46;

"In his debut, Barratier proves himself a capable director, one with a gift for handling those most mercurial and unreliable of actors, children."

"Mildly compelling and amusing, but somewhat uneven and dull. The sexy Trieste Kelly Dunn invigorates the film in a radiant, charismatic performance."
"Terrifically spooky and original, the film continues to feel completely modern despite being almost a quarter-century old."

"Paranormal Activity isn't an actor's film per se, but it wouldn't be as eerily effective without Featherston and Sloat's believable, lived in performances."

"Less a horror film than a valentine, from a daughter to a father, and a sweet portrait of a man going gently into that good night."
"Combines a few lovable Hollywood icons, an admittedly goofball plot, some sweet-natured romance, and brilliant rapid-fire exchanges of breathless comedic dialogue."

"""Love is making someone who is sad feel happy,"" one girl says, answering an interviewer's question. ""Blood Brother"" showed me that love. I doubt I'll be the only one."

The Jungle Book is everything it was expected to be and so much more.

"This movie is a time-filler, something you can have on in the background while you're doing something else, and can glance at whenever the shooting starts."

It feels human. It is human. And it's the best film of the year.

But something strange happens once Drew Barrymore shows up -- the movie starts getting good. Really good.

"Though there's nothing particularly new in the Hellboy narrative, it's easy to be captivated by del Toro's style and the film's overall panache."
"An intelligent, action-packed thriller, made on a modest budget with no mega stars? Phew! Didn't see that coming."

"Despite a predictable story and some awkward visuals, Giant Slayer is surprisingly entertaining - thanks to a hefty dose of well-timed humor and energetic performances."

The ending feels at odds with the rest of the film.
...a wonderful time warp movie with pace and style.
"Not content with a basic premise of crime and punishment, director Bong Joon Ho goes a step further, eventually corkscrewing off on a tangent that drags out the running time."
Turn your brain off and turn up the blood splatter.

"Farhadi is one of those filmmakers whose personal style is as steadfast as Marvel's: allowing for a few cosmetic tweaks and squeaks each time, you generally know what you're going to get. And generally, it's very good."
"Mr. Bertino, who also wrote the undercooked script, sets the scene effectively, using his leads to give the story a sense of normalcy that he dismantles trick by genre trick."

"An icily slick and funny Florida urban thriller in the style of Carl Hiaasen, carried with great deadpan style by Paige."
"A great role for a truly great talent, who just happens to be in her 70s. The movie is just under 90 minutes, but Tomlin delivers in that short time. Her wise-cracking one-liners are tempered by a real sense of loss and vulnerability."
People is an utterly fascinating watch.

"A delightful storyteller, Troche comes up with wholly unexpected and consistently effective bits of visual punctuation and she has a subtle way with sensuality and a secure touch with non-professional actors."
A violent movie about the routine as a safe place and how this one lack in our everyday life. [Full review in Spanish]
"Shooting in crisp black-and-white and with sparse dialogue (on title cards), Berger creates gorgeous scenes that evoke not only the silent era but early '30s horror (including a reference to Tod Browning's Freaks that's oddly endearing)."
"This seventh film in the Planet of the Apes series rises to such ridiculous heights, it's impossible not to laugh out loud -- in a good way, in appreciation."
"Though replete with amusing situations and clever lines, its strongest suit is the delicately pitched comic performances of its actors, most especially star Kevin Kline."
"Along With the Gods: The Two Worlds is an inquisition into human flaws, using Ja-hong as a vehicle to explore how they can be redeemed as such."
"""Catch Me"" feels capable of charming the masses with star power, a pop-induced score and sentimental moments that have become a Spielberg trademark."
"Chadwick Boseman is so formidable that, were the film itself just a bit better, he would eventually be basking in the same sort of year-end accolades that greeted Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles and Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash. Who knows, he may yet."
"It's a breathtakingly beautiful film, never mawkish, never less than vibrantly real and never more affecting than when it explores the nature of a love that 'dare not speak its name', not in Nazi Germany"

Hood knows how to crank the tension and a certain fury ticks under the story.

"""Try Harder!"" puts human faces on the college admissions fiasco, prompting viewers to empathize with overachievers unaccustomed to failure and whose self-worth is inextricably tied to which universities they get into."
"In spite of the pervasive melancholy, ""Stan & Ollie"" also carries a sweetness and dignity that ennobles its subjects. A lot of that has to do with the warm performances from Coogan and Reilly, who disappear into their roles."
One of the insights writer-director Johnson brings to the movie is a political and cultural awareness of what is going on in today's society - a denigration and suspicion of outsiders.

Brigsby Bear will reaffirm your belief in the positive powers of imagination.
A solid Christmas-themed dysfunctional family drama is enlivened by its superior cast of fine Latino stars.
"It's a very tasteful heart-tugger - a drama of disarmingly level-headed empathy that glides along with wit, assurance, and grace, and has something touching and resonant to say about the current climate of American bullying."
Beneath the viscera and grue is a tender and affecting tale of first love and discovery&#46; It&#8217;s as elegant as carnal and carnivorous&#44; and it&#8217;ll take a bite out of your heart if you let it&#46;
"Talk to Her is a sad falsetto ballad, holding onto hope like a dove cupped in two gentle hands in the midst of blood-splattered bullhorns and slow death."

"Fauci has an actual structural focus that's smartly considered and interesting, even if it left me with myriad questions."
Sean Penn does a great job.
"Equal parts sultry, humorous, and heartbreaking, Hustlers brings a needed female perspective to an industry poorly portrayed by Hollywood. Constance Wu and Jennifer Lopez are a lock for Oscar nominations."
An impressive action sequel that stays away from everything other than pure escapism&#46; And that&apos;s great&#33;
"Red Penguins is a wild and crazy story well told, especially in the first half, by Polsky, who is emerging as a gifted documentarian."
Matteo Garrone's stunning intertwining trilogy of macabre and peculiar fairy tales is brought to breathtaking life by a precise and painterly hand.
Sundown does lure one in and then keeps the audience on edge with a tight grasp all throughout the film's 83 minutes runtime.

Clever but manipulative.
"If you can get past the film's few potholes, it has the power to really make you squirm."
"[An] intelligent, thought-provoking political drama. Underpinning it all is classy filmmaking from Jason Reitman...who gets a fine ensemble cast moving to the same beat."
Google my words: it's a winner. It may not be as great as Wedding Crashers but this re-teaming of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson was worth the 8-year wait.

"Incredibly satisfying, because it feels like every moment in the first chapter eventually does pay off, some in quite emotional ways."

"Scott manages to fill in the finer brushstrokes of all those characters and still fit the kind of bravura action set pieces he's known for; the fight scenes are breathlessly, bone-crunchingly brutal."

"Death in Venice occasionally suffers from Visconti's artistic overindulgence, but the film's strengths are also paradoxically tied up in its helmer's unwavering eye for detail."
"Despite flaws (it's overlong and too theatrical, betraying its stage origins), this stylishly made cat-and-mouse thriller with strong social class overtones boasts great performances from Olivier and Michael Caine."
"What makes this such a moving family drama are the complicated characters that this talent cast creates, and the relationships between them it so effectively explores."
Anyone with a weakness for song-and-dance dementia on the level of Forbidden Zone and Cannibal! The Musical will find all this irresistible.

Hair High is the actually the artist's most cohesive 'story' to date...which means it's only about 35% weirder than any other sort of animation out there.
"This blue-collar ""Ocean's Eleven"" is a smooth-running, pleasantly familiar crime caper. In a movie full of cons, the greatest may be how deceptively easy Steven Soderbergh makes the whole enterprise seem."
"...basically just sits there for a good long hour before it picks up any sensible speed. Is it all worth it, though? In ways."

"While Caught won't abduct everyone's attention, it's a strange, unique, and intense indie that will be welcomed by both sci-fi and horror fans alike."
"Take it for what it is: An old guy who gives himself one last juicy role as the flawed, haunted anti-hero, an old guy who's done this so often that he isn't above making himself look silly as well as heroic (he even croons the title song over the ending c"
"It's a slow effort, painfully so at times, but the reward is a sharp psychological study that ends up being the most interesting conflict in the movie."
Boogie Nights for Gen Z...
"Parts of the film are frustrating, and downright suspenseful, because Marija earns our respect while no one else gives her any. Thanks to Jaktait&#279;'s bracing performance, we know she also internalizes this hard-earned truth."
"Very violent, mostly in comic-book terms."
The cast ... manages to give thoughtful performances that salvage the film's integrity.

A classic gets even better.
"In some ways, Coppola improves on the original film, but at the very least the different actors make for a different dynamic."
"Room 237 is a fascinating study of what fans of the film believe, and it's an entertaining look at that world-especially if you're not immersed it in it everyday."
"It's hard to resist a satire, even when it wobbles, that insists the most unbelievable parts are the most true."
Close to an XL for me. It's a sequel that uses a rehash of storylines and characters that still actually held up.
"I'd rank being stuck in a big quiet house at night as one of life's most easily unnerving experiences, and this movie capitalizes on it."
No franchise like Scream has to constantly reinvent itself with meta narratives while also keeping direct connections to its original installments&#46; Scream VI is a mean&#44; nasty&#44; rollicking good time at the movies&#44; just as Wes Craven always intended&#46;

"Captures a raw and honest look at the feeling of being trapped in a life you never asked for, wanting so desperately to get yourself out of it, but realizing that you're probably stuck there for good."
"A clever, enjoyable movie, with enough thrills and laughs to keep all ages entertained!"
"As freewheeling and irreverent as the man himself, Saint Misbehavin' is that rare documentary whose flaws seem appropriate for its subject matter."
a wickedly funny and stylish take on a childrens classic that conjures family fun with a typically dark Roald Dahl edge. 
"A collage of emotions, shifting through scenes that are happy, silly, angry, sexy, even sad."
I seriously love this movie.

"""Spider-Man: Far from Home"" isn't really a superhero movie. It's a wholesome teen comedy disguised as a superhero movie."
This all-too-familiar gloom and doom tale is depressing and feels longer than the 104-minute running time. The acting is top drawer from the powerhouse cast of respected thespians.

There are still good vampire movies being made. Like this one.

This place is less crossroads of the world than land of confusion.
"The impact of Peter Jackson's King Kong is as massive as the gigantic gorilla itself, a spectacle to marvel at, but most importantly, a story with which we can connect emotionally."
"The story, about a young soldier who is torn between leaving the army and loyalty to his brothers at arms, is affecting and well acted ..."
"The microcosm Delmer Daves creates here would make Billy Wilder pause, and the final five minutes are a masterstroke of nihilism."
Zombieland&#58; Double Tap is perfect for fans of the original&#44; especially in keeping its focus squarely on original characters but the film isn&apos;t perfect overall and it&apos;s hard to say it will pull in new fans&#46;
The scenery is beautiful and it is a fun ride along with Emily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson but it is no African Queen.

It may move you to tears -- you'll also bust a gut laughing at his dialogue-recording scenes from Aladdin and stage-show improvs -- but this important documentary about the last days of actor Robin Williams is must viewing.
"Wonder Woman ends with a sequel on the horizon, that will certainly get made if the movie inspires little girls to ditch their Disney Princess regalia and learn to scare off creeps with the raise of an eyebrow, the Gal Gadot way."
"It's a fascinating bundle of contradictions--authentic in a million details, deeply romanticized in others. Cool, calm and collected, this is more love story than gangster picture."
"It's a pleasure to see a movie about people in their 50s, assessing their lives as they deal with the long farewell of a parent."

"The film is a meticulously, perhaps even cynically crafted crowd-pleaser. Even those alive to its tactics might find themselves wiping away a tear or two."

"A total celebration of theatre, history and politics."
"In this summer of raunchy, hilarious R-rated comedies, Virgin fits right in--even if the one-joke premise gets a little stale towards the end."
"A crime of cinematic passion, a daring attempt at replicating a famed artist's visionary style in animated form, and a somewhat plodding detective story told in wheezy old narrative tropes that violate an often ravishing technique."
"Deadwyler gives a career-making performance as Mamie, perfectly poised between grief and strength. The film, which is dedicated to Mamie, ultimately belongs to her."
"Martin Scorsese's dbut feature has just the slightest bit of story line, but the movie is a fascinating portfolio piece: a black-and-white blueprint for ""Mean Streets."""
Mostly enjoyable and only slightly too long.

What's so lovely here is Manuel's warmth and humanity - the way he lives with regrets and disappointment.
The minute you hear the Downton Abbey theme it's like coming back home. Director Julian Fellowes out did himself with a marvelous transfer of the beloved series without skipping a beat on its essence. Maggie Smith's quick wit is absolutely fantabulous
"What's amazing is the mixture of willpower and uncertainty, mendacity and credulity, gracefulness and self-conscious posing that [DiCaprio] conveys, even before you see him speak."

It&#8217;s a traditional sci-fi horror picture that doesn&#8217;t break new ground outside of its slick advertising trick&#46; But is it really trying to break new ground&#63; I would argue it&#8217;s trying to make a fun&#44; intriguing &#8220;Cloverfield&#8221; installment&#46;
"24th Century Women is irreducible ... although certain adjectives and adverbs do leap to mind: generous, reflective, absolutely delightful."
A wild and wicked film that should make anyone think twice before grabbing that Egg McMuffin on the way to work or 'treating' their kids to a meal almost engineered to make them sick.

One of [Godard's] most entertaining movies is also one of his most timeless.

Any A- or B- list actress would jump at the chance to work with the [screenwriters].

"Director Dexter Fletcher paints Eddie's story in broad, bold strokes, never missing an opportunity to milk a suspenseful dramatic turn or go for the relatively easy laugh -- but it's a style well-suited to this wonderfully ridiculous story."
"It's bold, captivating cinema, with a soundtrack that threatens to never leave your head."
"In Nighy, the witty script leaps to life, in a tour-de-force of darkly downbeat comedic timing..."
"Seymour is intriguing, mainly because it brings together two uniquely talented artists -- Hawke and Bernstein -- and captures them in thought and ocasionally in conversation, sometimes together but more often on their own."

Eternals is messy but there is beauty in its parts if not necessarily the sum.
"By approaching Marshall as just another idealistic young trial lawyer, the film stands on its own as a compelling courtroom drama, complete with surprising revelations ..."

"It won't blow you away, but it remains a well-played and solidly entertaining family film."
"The story is good enough to tell itself, and the filmmakers should have let it."

"The Hunt for Planet B delivers a captivating viewing experience, showing the sometimes-thin line between science fiction and the true scientific future."

"Somehow, among the clichs and familiar story lines, the actors rise above the muck and make a movie that's entertaining to watch."

I admire this. Claire Denis is still directing thoughtful sci-fi.
It's a social and political commentary of a modern day industrial power and the polarisation and inequality prevalent in most developing nations.
Phoenix's performance overwhelms the slight story.
"Lighter and loopier than Bogdanovich's key '70s pics and naughtier and rather more cynical than his woofy What's Up, Doc?, She's Funny That Way is certainly amusing for the first and second acts."
"With its jittery stop-motion animation, exquisitely detailed shots, and outwardly self-aware characters,[it's] the epitome of artifice. It's also as bright and cheery a time as you'll have at the movies this year."
A powerful and atmospheric film that delivers a barrage of images and concepts of both sexual and philosophical natures.

"Like another Australian musical by a then young director, Gillian Armstrong's Starstruck from 1982, Bran Nue Dae carries the day with energy and self-belief."
City of Men does not have that piercing naturalistic horror and drive of its predecessor. But it stands on its own as a chronicle of enduring friendship in impossibly horrid circumstances.

"When 2014 Godzilla finally fully emerges from the deep like a gloriously meaty centerfold straight out of Bulk Reptile magazine -- a creation that's part performance capture, part computer stuff, thankfully looking nothing like a CG cartoon -- we cheer."
"The film overextends itself a little as twist piles upon twist and in terms of narrative it's not entirely successful, but as a masterclass in microbudget film-making this is well worth a look."
A touching film that perhaps spends a bit too much time digging in the wrong places.
Sexy and wry.

"Durham is a decent enough way to pass away a few hours on a weekend, especially if you love the game, but it ain't gonna change your life."

"It's a film that deserves to be seen, be discussed and win awards."
"Normally I'm not averse to time-shifting in movies, but in this case I found the device unhelpful. Individual scenes are superbly staged and the cast is flawless, making the film essential viewing for lovers of the book."

A tribute to how entrenched the Rugrats are in our hearts.

"Stirring film, capable of moving you even as it gives you a new perspective from the past on an issue that continues to plague us, here in the future."
"Rock's script isn't afraid to get raunchy, sometimes a little too much, but there is a bit of heart at the center. Dawson and Rock have the chemistry to make it work, even when it feels a little contrived."

... unnerving take on the home-invasion picture...
